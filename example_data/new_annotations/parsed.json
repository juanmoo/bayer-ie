The AUC and C max  of dehydro-\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant\nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole\ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of\nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh\nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole\noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to\nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon\ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased\nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g.\ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases\nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected."
