<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Quality aspects</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Introduction</head><p>The product comprises as active substance apixaban: a novel, orally active, selective, direct, reversible inhibitor of the coagulation factor Xa (FXa).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Active Substance</head><p>The INN name of the active substance is apixaban and it chemical name is 1-(4-Methoxyphenyl)-7oxo-6-[4-(2-oxopiperidin-1-yl)phenyl]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1Hpyrazolo <ref type="bibr">[3,4-c]</ref>pyridine-3-carboxamide. The molecular formula of the active substance is C 25 H 25 N 5 O 4 , its relative molecular mass 459.50 and its structural formula is shown below.</p><p>Apixaban appears as a white to pale yellow, non hygroscopic crystalline powder, with an aqueous solubility of 0.028 mg/ml at 24°C. Apixaban is a non-ionizable compound and its partition coefficient at 24°C is 44.7 (log Po/w = 1.65) at pH 7.4 (n-Octanol / aqueous buffer). The molecule has no chiral centres, therefore, no stereoisomers exist. It shows polymorphism and a number of hydrates and solvates were identified. However, only one form is consistently produced by the proposed synthetic process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacture</head><p>The commercial manufacturing process for the synthesis of apixaban involves a sequence of five reactions with two isolated intermediates. The quality by design (QbD) concept has been used during the development of the manufacturing process for Apixaban drug substance. The critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the drug substance were identified on the basis of their potential impact on the safety and efficacy of the drug product and thus to the patient. Based on risk assessment and development work, critical process parameters (CPPs) were identified for some of the process steps. Multivariate experimental design and mechanistic models were used to understand the effect of process parameters on those steps. The outcome of these studies is the proposed CPPs and proven acceptable ranges (PARs). The validity of the design space at commercial scale is supported by data from batches manufactured at pilot scale In-process controls for those steps where no critical process parameters were identified are applied and they are considered sufficient for their adequate control.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specification</head><p>The drug substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), colour (visual), identification (Raman/IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), heavy metals (ICP-MS) and particle size (laser light scattering). The control strategy in relation to potential genotoxic impurities was developed from a detailed process understanding of the fate of these impurities in the downstream process and a combination of data from historical batches and spiking and purging experiments to understand the process clearance capability of the impurities.</p><p>Page 9/62</p><p>All genotoxic materials are tested upstream and the proposed limits are sufficient to ensure that none of them is over the proposed limit in the final active substance. For those not tested, adequate supporting data have been provided. Batch data and results of experiments confirmed that the genotoxic impurities from the early process steps are not carried through to the drug substance. This has been confirmed on 14 batches of apixaban active substance. It was further confirmed there are no new genotoxic impurities introduced or formed at the final step of the manufacture of the active substance and therefore testing of the genotoxic impurities in the final active substance is not considered necessary in light of the supporting data provided. In relation to the genotoxic related substances of the genotoxic impurities, these follow the same fate in the downstream process as their respective parent compound and therefore, their contribution to the total concentration is practically negligible based on the ratio of input amounts (parent compound versus related substance) and residual levels observed for each of the parent compound. An overview of all batches used in clinical and toxicological studies, is provided. Batch analysis results were presented for eight commercial batches manufactured according to the commercial process all meeting the set requirements. The batch data provided is considered sufficient in support of the control of the active substance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability</head><p>Stability studies have been performed on three batches in line with ICH Guidelines under the following conditions long-term (5°C, 25°C/60%RH), intermediate (30°C/65%RH) and accelerated (40°C/75%RH). Stability data have been provided for 36 months under long-term conditions and for six months under accelerated conditions In addition results from studies under stress conditions (-20°C, 50°C, 40°C/75%RH open) for three batches and for photo-stability for one batch were also provided. There were no changes from initial values observed in the tested parameters at any condition. Based on the provided data the proposed re-test period and storage condition are justified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Finished Medicinal Product</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmaceutical Development</head><p>It is remarked that the formulation and manufacturing process for the apixaban tablets were designed to produce tablets with rapid disintegration and dissolution characteristics ensuring consistent and acceptable bioavailability. Apixaban is non-ionisable, and therefore, its aqueous solubility is not affected by changes in pH. It is highly soluble for doses up to 10 mg and is a low permeable compound since the fraction of oral dose absorbed is &lt; 90%. Thus, as per the Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS), it is classified as a Class III (high solubility/low permeability) compound. Information on different strengths that were used in the early stages of the clinical development was presented. However, only the 2.5 mg and 5 mg were selected for Phase 3 studies and commercialisation. Only the 2.5 mg tablet will be commercialised for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) which is the object of this application. Therefore, only the data related to the 2.5 mg strength is assessed on this assessment report. It is noted however, that both 2.5 and 5 mg tablets are manufactured from a common granulate. Development work included the evaluation of the different types of granulation and the use of a film coat for the tablets. It was found that tablets made using the dry granulation process have more consistent dissolution rates. Based on a relative bioavailability study results, the minimum dissolution requirement for apixaban was established. The film coat of the tablet is non-functional and has no impact on drug product performance. It has been optimised during development with regard to the aesthetic aspect. The actual changes between the Phase 3 and commercial tablets formulations are minor and comparative batch data including dissolution has been presented showing no significant differences in the results obtained. The particle size of the drug substance was identified as a critical factor based on its influence on the dissolution of the tablets. A study was conducted to establish the drug substance particle size requirement that would produce the required in-vitro drug release and appropriate limit has been set.</p><p>A drug-excipient compatibility study was conducted to screen potential excipients to be used in formulation development. No incompatibilities with any excipient tested were observed. These excipients are conventional and the amounts per tablet are within their typical levels of usage in solid dosage forms. The tablet excipients are of compendial grades. The individual components of the film-coating are of compendial grades too.</p><p>Page 10/62</p><p>The development of the dissolution method is adequately described and the discriminative ability of the dissolution method has been sufficiently demonstrated. To establish the design space and control strategy for the commercial manufacture, relationships between the input attributes and process parameters and the output attributes for each unit operation were evaluated. A study was conducted to determine the steps that would be required to ensure the production of a uniform blend. Process development studies for the remaining unit operations were also conducted for the development of a robust commercial manufacturing process for apixaban tablets. No additional process development was conducted for the film-coating process step as typical coating procedures are followed. It was recognized that because of the targeted low dose for apixaban, content uniformity of the final product becomes an important product attribute Since the drug substance is mixed with most of the excipients at the 1st blending step (preblending), a quantitative on-line NIR method was developed to monitor the mixing profile during the preblending unit operation, including the acceptance criteria for determining the blending endpoint. The proposed commercial manufacturing process uses process analytical technology (PAT), as well as conventional analytical tests, to control the in-process intermediates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adventitious agents</head><p>Lactose used in the manufacture of tablets is of animal origin (bovine milk). Statements from the suppliers attesting and finished product manufacturer in relation to the quality of lactose are provided. It is confirmed that all lactose used complies with EMEA/410/41/00/01 Rev.2 "Note for Guidance on Minimising Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents via Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacture of the product</head><p>The manufacturing process comprises the following main steps: blending, granulation, blending, tabletting, film-coating and packaging. The prospective process validation for Eliquis film coated tablets will be successfully completed prior to launch of the commercial product. The validation batches will be processed according to an approved manufacturing batch record and as per an approved Process Validation Protocol. During the validation study, process steps will be monitored and the results will be covered in a Process Validation Report. All validation sample testing, including all release testing, must meet predetermined acceptance criteria which will be based on the approved specification for release testing. Due to the initially proposed use of NIR (as PAT) and RTR for the manufacturing of the drug product, the proposed finished product manufacturing site has been inspected in relation to this application during the clock-stop period. Responses to observations have been received and found to be mostly adequate. An Inspection Report in relation to this product specific inspection has been produced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Product specification</head><p>The release and shelf-life specifications of the solvent include tests and limits for appearance (visual), identification (Raman, IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units/ content uniformity (Ph Eur), disintegration (Ph Eur), impurities/degradants (HPLC -stability only), dissolution (HPLC-stability only) and Microbial Limit Test (Ph Eur -not routinely). The elimination of dissolution testing for apixaban drug product is considered justified in view of (a) the established surrogate (drug substance particle size control) and (b) applying a comprehensive control strategy (design space on composition and process; upstream/in-process controls). Based on the evidence of stability of apixaban, the control of impurities in the drug substance is considered sufficient to ensure the quality of the drug product at release because the impurity content of the drug product comes only from process-related impurities contained in the drug substance. Thus, the proposal not to test for impurities/degradants for batch release is considered justified. Batch analysis data for five batches of the commercial formulation (from two sites (including the proposed one) have been presented. All results comply with the specifications and for these bathes.</p><p>Results from 8 batches of the Phase 3 formulation provided were also within specifications. In addition results from a number of batches of early development formulations were presented all within specifications.</p><p>Page 11/62</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability of the product</head><p>Stability studies are presented for three batches stored under long term conditions at 5°C, 25°C/60%RH and 30°C/65%RH up to 24 months and under accelerated conditions at 40°C/75%RH up to 6 months. An increase (approximately 1%-2%) in water content values was observed for the tablets packaged in PVC/PVDC blisters. However, there was no impact on any other attributes. All tested parameters are within the proposed specification. Additional data were presented from studies under stress conditions (50°C, 25°C/60% RH open, 40°C/75%RH open, photostability (as per ICH) and freeze-thaw cycling). The results indicate that the drug product is stable under all stress conditions employed and that any changes observed did not impact any critical quality attributes of the tablets such as appearance, potency, impurities or dissolution.</p><p>The overall data support the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4.">Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects</head><p>The quality of Eliquis film coated tablets is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The quality of the active substance is considered sufficiently described and adequately supported by data. Sufficient chemical and pharmaceutical documentation relating to development, manufacture and control of the drug product has been presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.5.">Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects</head><p>The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.</p><p>Stability tests indicate that the product under ICH guidelines conditions is chemically stable for the proposed shelf life.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Pharmacology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary pharmacodynamic studies</head><p>Apixaban inhibits free factor Xa (FXa) as well as thrombus-associated FXa and FXa within the prothrombinase complex. Unlike the direct inhibitors of FXa, apixaban does not require antithrombin III to inhibit FXa. By inhibiting FXa, apixaban reduces directly tissue factor-induced thrombin generation and indirectly thrombin-mediated platelet aggregation, suggesting that it may prevent and treat both venous as well as arterial thrombosis. The major circulating metabolite of apixaban, O-desmethyl apixaban sulfate, does not significantly inhibit human FXa.</p><p>In diabetic/obese mice, twice daily dosing of apixaban significantly decreased elevated levels of thrombotic biomarkers. In a broad range of experimental models of thrombosis in rabbits, rats, and dogs, apixaban demonstrated antithrombotic efficacy at doses that resulted in modest changes in standard coagulation assays. Substantial prevention of both venous and arterial thrombosis was achieved at apixaban doses that produced minor changes in bleeding times, while higher doses resulted in more pronounced increases in clotting times and bleeding times. In addition, apixaban also effectively inhibited the growth of a preformed intravascular thrombus, suggesting the potential opportunities for apixaban in the treatment of thrombosis.</p><p>In conclusion, the results showed that apixaban is a highly potent, selective, rapid and reversible inhibitor of the human coagulation factor Xa.</p><p>Page 12/62</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary pharmacodynamic studies</head><p>In the ligand binding and enzymatic assays, apixaban did not significantly alter ligand binding or activity (≥50% of control) in any of the assays, thereby suggesting high selectivity of apixaban for FXa. Next to these assays, no other secondary pharmacodynamic studies were performed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety pharmacology programme</head><p>Safety pharmacology studies were performed to examine the potential effects of apixaban on cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cardiovascular system</head><p>The potential effects of apixaban on the cardiovascular system were evaluated in in vitro and in vivo safety pharmacology and nonclinical toxicology studies, including the in vitro hERG and rabbit Purkinje fiber assay, 2 single-dose (oral and IV) cardiovascular telemetry studies in beagle dogs, an escalating IV dose cardiovascular study in mongrel dogs, a 3-month and 1-year oral toxicity study in dogs with cardiovascular assessment. In addition, the potential effect of the major metabolite, O-desmethyl apixaban sulfate, on the cardiovascular system was evaluated independently utilizing in vitro assays.</p><p>At concentrations highly exceeding the human recommended dose, apixaban and its metabolite had no significant effects in the hERG and Purkinje fiber assay, indicating a low probability for prolongation of the QT interval and the action potential duration. In anesthetised dogs, apixaban caused death and adverse cardiovascular effects. However, these adverse effects are most likely related to the combination of anaesthesia and the vehicle used to deliver apixaban, since no adverse effects were observed following administration of apixaban to conscious dogs at doses that induce higher Cmax values than those reached in the anesthetised dogs. All doses tested are highly exceeding the human recommended dose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Respiratory system</head><p>In repeat-dose toxicity studies that included assessment of respiratory rates, lung sounds (thoracic auscultation), and/or arterial oxygen saturation in dogs, apixaban caused no adverse findings at the highest doses tested (dog ≤ 20 mg/kg/day for up to 3 months, AUC is 41× the clinical AUC).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Central nervous system</head><p>Neurologic evaluations assessed mental state, gait, posture, cranial nerve function (assessed through menace response, pupillary light response, lid blink, eye retraction, gag reflex, eye position at rest, muscle palpation, and tongue examination) and peripheral nerve function (muscle tone, spinal reflexes, and postural reactions). In addition, body temperature was measured. In a 3-month repeated dose toxicity study in dogs, apixaban produced no neurologic changes indicative of CNS toxicity at AUC values 41× the clinical AUC.</p><p>In conclusion, at doses highly exceeding the human recommended dose, apixaban did not induce respiratory or CNS toxicity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacodynamic drug interactions</head><p>In rabbits, the combination apixaban with aspirin and/or clopidogrel significantly enhanced antithrombotic activity without excessive increases in bleeding time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Pharmacokinetics</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytical methods</head><p>The analytical methods used in the different pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic studies were welldescribed and properly validated. Results of interday precision, intraday precision,accuracy and stability were satisfactory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Absorption</head><p>Page 13/62</p><p>In vitro data with excised segments of rat duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon, showed that apixaban is absorbed throughout the rat intestinal tract. The permeability coefficient in the jejunum provided evidence for involvement of an intestinal efflux transport mechanism. A range of in vitro studies in monolayers of Caco-2 cells expressing a number of efflux transporters including P-gp and BCRP, porcine kidney-derived cells (LLC-PK1) transfected with P-gp transporters, canine kidney-derived (MDCKII) cells transfected with BCRP transporters, indicated that apixaban is a substrate for both P-gp and BCRP, and it is not transported by MRP or OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OATP2B1 transporters. These active transport mechanisms may play a role in the limited bioavailability after oral administration of apixaban. In addition, evidence was found for paracellular transport. Absorption may also be limited by dissolution rate (at high doses).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Single dose pharmacokinetics</head><p>In a comparative study elimination half-life in rats (2-3 hrs) was shorter than in dogs (5-6 hrs) and chimpanzees (5-7 hrs). Distribution volume is relatively low in rats (0.31 L/kg), dogs (0.30 L/kg) and chimpanzees (0.17 L/kg). Clearance (rat 4.3 ml/min/kg, dog 0.87 ml/min/kg, chimpanzee 0.30 ml/min/kg) is low (10, 2 and 1% respectively) compared to hepatic blood flow.</p><p>The toxicokinetic data show that exposure increases less than dose-proportional. In particular at high doses and in the dietary studies exposure hardly increased with increasing dose. There is no evidence of sex-related differences. In some studies exposure increases somewhat with prolonged administration, but this is not consistently found in all studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distribution</head><p>Plasma to blood ratios of about one in dog and human blood indicate uniform distribution between plasma and red blood cells and thus no specific distribution to red blood cells.</p><p>Protein binding differs between the species. The unbound fraction at concentrations of 1-10 µM is about 13% in human vs about 4% in rats and 8% in dogs. At the tested concentrations there was no effect of concentration or gender. In mice protein binding is much lower, with 44-67 % unbound, dependent on the tested concentration (range 100 -2000 ng apixaban/ml). These differences between the species used in the toxicological studies and humans should be taken into account in interpreting the toxicology studies.</p><p>Two single dose radiolabel distribution studies were provided in rats. The data show a wide distribution, with the highest values in excretory organs (liver, kidney, urinary bladder (and contents), bile) and intestinal tract (and contents). After a dose of 20 mg/kg in male Long-Evans rats also relatively high Cmax and AUC were found in adrenals, lungs, thyroid gland, but after a dose of 5 mg/kg in Sprague Dawley rats (both sexes) these organs showed Cmax similar to most other organs and tissues. There was no qualitative difference in distribution between male and female rats, but the female rats showed higher Cmax values in the intestinal tract.</p><p>Distribution in pregnant rats/fetuses: Cmax in amnion was high. Significant concentrations were found in placenta and fetal blood, kidney and liver. Toxicokinetic data collected in the reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in rats, mice and rabbits showed that generally fetal plasma concentrations of apixaban were lower than those in the dams. Distribution to rat milk: Pregnant rats showed a high Cmax in mammary gland. Concentrations of apixaban in rat milk exceed those in blood and plasma. The high concentration in milk vs plasma (at the plasma Tmax (0.5 hr) 8.5 fold, AUC in milk was about 30 fold plasma AUC) suggests involvement of active transport (possibly BCRP transporter). Elimination half life from rat milk, blood and plasma was similar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metabolism</head><p>Apixaban is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4/5 with conjugation via SULT1A1, but several other CYP and SULT isozymes are also involved. No apixaban metabolites were found to have pharmacological activity and there were no unique human metabolites.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Excretion</head><p>After single oral administration of radiolabelled apixaban to intact male mice, male rats, female rabbits or male dogs, most of the dose was excreted in faeces (in mice about 70% in the first 12 hrs, in rats and dogs about 70% in the first 48 hrs, and in female rabbits about 55 % in the first 48 hrs) and most of the remainder of the dose in urine (mice about 14% in the first 12 hrs, rats 11-13% in 48 hrs, dogs about 8.5% in 48 hrs, and female rabbits much less : 2% in 48hrs). Bile-duct cannulated rats showed that part of the dose was eliminated by the biliary route (about 3% over a 48 hr period after oral gavage). After intravenous infusion intact male rats or female rabbits excreted a larger part into urine Page 14/62 (male rats 21% and female rabbits 23% in 24 hrs). Intravenously treated bile-duct cannulated rats excreted even more into urine (47% in 24 hrs) and also a large part into bile (23% in 24 hrs). Most of the faecally and urinary eliminated material consists of parent compound. A large part of the faecally cleared material is probably unabsorbed apixaban. Furthermore, there is evidence for secretion of apixaban and metabolites into the intestine which is mostly likely caused by excretion via Pglycoprotein. The rabbit data showed a much larger extent of biotransformation (larger role of metabolic clearance) in this species compared to the other species.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacokinetic interactions</head><p>Apixaban is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP; inhibition was only observed at concentrations 25 times the maximal observed human plasma concentrations. In addition, apixaban does not affect the absorption of drugs that are P-glycoprotein substrates. Since apixaban is a substrate for CYP3A4/5, BCRP, and P-glycoprotein, co-administration of drugs that modulate their activities could affect the absorption and disposition of apixaban. However, the relatively low dependence of apixaban on metabolic clearance for its elimination and the multiple pathways available for apixaban elimination (renal and biliary clearance and, possibly, intestinal secretion) suggests that any such effects are likely to be of relatively low magnitude. Since apixaban is a substrate for the P-glycoprotein transporter, its absorption may be affected by P-glycoprotein inhibitors. The SmPC advises caution when coadministering apixaban with strong inhibitors and inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein.</p><p>Other pharmacokinetics studies In fasted beagle dogs, bioavailability of apixaban was reduced (up to 50%) by active charcoal treatment, given 0.25 -3 hrs after the oral apixaban dose. The highest reduction was found when activated charcoal was administered 3 hrs after the apixaban dose (1 hour before Tmax).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.4.">Toxicology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Single dose toxicity</head><p>Single dose oral studies in mice (up to 4000 mg/kg), rats (up to 4510 mg/kg), dogs (up to 1500 mg/kg) and cynomolgus monkeys (up to 300 mg/kg) revealed no other drug-related effects than those related to the pharmacodynamic action of apixaban. In particular some monkeys died due to excessive bleeding after blood sampling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeat dose toxicity</head><p>In the repeated dose studies, up to 6 months with a recovery phase in rats (doses up to 600 mg/kg/day, AUC up to apixaban up to 30 times human AUC at a dose of 2.5 mg BID) and to 1 year in dogs (doses up to 100 mg/kg/day, AUC up to &gt; 80 times human AUC at a dose of 2.5 mg BID), apixaban showed no significant toxicity. The major observed effects were those on blood coagulation parameters: PT and aPTT and, sometimes, fibrinogen and/or bleeding time. In some studies, minor effects on blood cells and/or on serum K, Na and/or Cl and/or evidence of subclinical haemorrhage was observed. Exposure to the major metabolite O-demethyl apixaban sulfate was not measured in the pivotal long term repeated dose studies. However, based on separate 7-day repeated dose pharmacokinetics studies in rats and dogs, systemic exposure to the metabolite was lower than in humans in the rat study and about similar to that in humans in the dog study. It is concluded that the metabolite has been tested in the pivotal studies, but that these studies reveal no exposure margin for the metabolite. Since conjugates are usually not more toxic than the unconjugated compounds, and in addition to the toxicity studies with limited exposure there were data showing the absence of effects of the metabolite in pharmacodynamic and safety pharmacology studies, no further toxicity data were deemed necessary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genotoxicity</head><p>Based on a battery of four genotoxicity assays (gene mutations in bacteria, chromosomal aberrations in vitro in CHO cells and in two in vivo assays in rat bone marrow (micronucleus assay) and rat peripheral blood lymphocytes) there was no evidence for genotoxicity of apixaban under the conditions of the assays.</p><p>Page 15/62</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Carcinogenicity</head><p>Two 2 year carcinogenicity studies were provided. In both studies apixaban was administered via the dietary route, up to a dose of 1500 mg/kg/day in male mice and 3000 mg/kg/day in female mice and up to a dose of 600 mg/kg in rats. Sufficient toxicokinetic data were provided. Both the mouse and the rat carcinogenicity study suggest a slight increase of tumours (benign -increased endometrial polypsin the mice, malignant -lymphoma -in the rats) at the highest dose level, however, with incidences still within the range of historical controls. Taking into account the provided historical data, the negative genotoxicity results and the absence of non-genotoxic toxicity which might lead to epigenetic tumour induction at high doses, it is concluded that it is most likely that the results are due to normal variability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reproduction Toxicity</head><p>In an oral fertility/early embryonic development study no effects on male or female fertility or on early embryonic development was found at tested doses of 0, 50, 200 and 600 mg apixaban/kg/day (from 2 weeks before mating through GD7 (females) or sacrifice (males)). The NOAEL was 600 mg/kg/day (AUC 28 µg.h/ml in males and 36 µg.h/ml in females). Embryo-foetal developmental studies were done in rats (doses 100-3000 mg/kg/day), mice (doses 600-1500 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (oral : 60 -1500 mg/kg/day, intravenous : 1.25 -5 mg/kg/day). In rats systemic exposure was confirmed, but no AUC was determined. However, based on limited measurements of plasma apixaban concentrations in the embryo-foetal developmental study and the exposure data from other rat studies it is plausible that exposure has been high enough. In mice, the AUC was &gt; 13 times human AUC at a dose of 2.5 mg BID. In the rabbit study, exposure after oral (AUC &lt; human AUC) as well as intravenous (AUC 2.5 times human AUC) administration remained low. The mouse study was added because of the low exposure in the rabbit study. In all three species, fetal plasma apixaban concentrations were lower than in the dam. The only observed effect during these studies consisted of red perivaginal substance in the rat study, presumably due to hemorrhage caused by the pharmacodynamic action of apixaban. In a rat pre/postnatal development study at doses of 0, 25, 200 and 1000 mg apixaban/kg/day from GD6 -post partum day 20, the only effects found in dams in addition to expected increases of PT and aPTT were increased incidence of red liquid/mucoid vaginal discharge. The only observed effects on the offspring were a slightly reduced mating and fertility indices in the F1 females. Although considered drug related the values were within the historical control range. In the absence of other changes on reproduction or development, the relevance of this finding for the clinical practice is doubtful. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity, and F1 male development was 1000 mg/kg/day (AUC 39 times human AUC) and for F1 female reproduction 25 mg/kg/day (AUC 9.75 times human AUC).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other toxicity studies</head><p>Juvenile toxicity study An exploratory juvenile rat toxicity study was done, in which cross-fostered rat pups were treated from postnatal day (PND) 4 to PND 23. Tested doses were 0, 25, 200 and 1000 mg/kg/day. On PND 23 the animals were sacrificed. No adverse effects were found. Toxicokinetic data show a relatively high systemic exposure on PND 10 with plasma concentrations at expected Tmax about 3-6 times the Cmax at PND23. This age-related systemic exposure is considered to reflect metabolic maturation of juvenile rats between PND 4 and 23. The AUC at the highest tested dose at PND 23 was about 50 times the human AUC. According to the non-clinical overview a definitive 90-day study (with 1 months recovery phase) in juvenile rats dosed from PND4 to 90 is currently ongoing with doses of 10, 50, and 600 mg/kg/day to support potential pediatric use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impurities</head><p>Since there are no impurities above the ICH qualification threshold of 0.15%, no further toxicity data of impurities are required. All potential genotoxic impurities are below the level of 150 ppm, resulting in a maximum exposure to below the TTC as defined in the Guideline on the limits of genotoxic impurities (EMEA/CHMP/QWP/251344/2006) and the Q&amp;A document of this guideline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phototoxicity</head><p>Based on an in vitro photoxicity test (3T3 NRU PT) in Balb/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts there is no evidence for phototoxic potential of apixaban. The appropriate studies have been conducted according to existing guidelines and have been found valid for use in the risk assessment. Based on the results of the Applicants' Phase II Tier A assessment, no adverse effects of apixaban are expected for the STP, surface water and groundwater compartment. Based on the results of the Applicants' Phase II Tier B assessment, no adverse effects of apixaban are expected for the sediment compartment. The overall conclusion is that no adverse effects on the environment are expected for apixaban.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.6.">Discussion on non-clinical aspects</head><p>Pharmacological and pharmacokinetic documentation were clear and satisfactory.</p><p>With regard to toxicology, the issues below were raised during assessment for further clarification.</p><p>1) The exposure to the major human metabolite O-desmethyl apixaban sulfate was relatively low in all animal toxicity studies, due to low formation in the animal species in spite of very high exposure to the parent compound. As a consequence the value of the toxicity studies for the safety assessment of this metabolite is very limited and additional data on the toxicity of this metabolite, e.g. by administering the metabolite instead of the parent compound, or for justification of not providing such data was further requested during assessment.</p><p>Based on the additional documentation submitted, it was concluded that Ο-desmethyl apixaban sulfate is not pharmacologically active and showed no significant activity in in vitro cardiovascular safety studies. However exposure at the highest dose levels in the repeated dose studies is not high enough to justify any margin of exposure for the toxicity studies. Since conjugates are usually not more toxic than the unconjugated compounds, and because some results from pharmacodynamic and safety pharmacology studies were available in addition to the toxicity studies with limited exposure, no further toxicity data are requested.</p><p>Page 18/62</p><p>2) In spite of very high systemic exposure, the toxicity studies hardly showed any toxicity related to the anticoagulatory effect of apixaban. Therefore, the applicant was asked to discuss the sensitivity of the animal species for the pharmacodynamic effect compared to humans for the interpretation of the non-clinical results, which suggest little risk of bleeding, even at overdose, e.g. around parturition.</p><p>Based on the additional documentation provided, the CHMP concluded that based on Cmax values there is about a factor 3 -5 between the highest values obtained in the long-term toxicity studies in rats and dogs and the lowest values at which significant pharmacodynamic effects were found. This is consistent with a difference in sensitivity between the tested species and humans. The low bleeding tendency found in toxicity studies should be interpreted with caution when extrapolating to humans. The point can be acceptable, provided that the following sentence is added to section 5.3. of the SMPC: "In the toxicity studies little to no increase of bleeding tendency was found. However, since this may be due to a lower sensitivity of the non-clinical species compared to humans, this result should be interpreted with caution when extrapolating to humans."</p><p>The CHMP raised the issue of potential hepatotoxicity referring to existing data in dogs at a dose of 30 mg/kg suggesting hepatotoxicity at a systemic exposure of 171 μg x hr/ml. The MAH provided further clarification on the results. It was concluded by the CHMP that the way of reporting the results of the two different histopathological assessments of the liver had caused confusion that needed to be further explained. After further review of the histopathological results of the other repeated dose studies, the CHMP agreed with the applicant that overall there was no evidence of hepatotoxicity.</p><p>The GLP status of some laboratories which carried out pivotal toxicity studies was further clarified and solved during the assessment. All pivotal safety studies were GLP-compliant, according to the study reports.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.7.">Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects</head><p>Overall preclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, fertility and embryo-foetal development. In the offspring of pregnant rats treated with apixaban there were decreases in mating and fertility. These effects were minimal and observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use.</p><p>The major observed effects in the repeated dose toxicity studies were those related to the pharmacodynamic action of apixaban on blood coagulation parameters. In the toxicity studies little to no increase of bleeding tendency was found.</p><p>However, since this may be due to a lower sensitivity of the non-clinical species compared to humans, this result should be interpreted with caution when extrapolating to human. This is highlighted in the SmPC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Clinical aspects</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.1.">Introduction</head><p>The clinical pharmacology profile of apixaban has been characterized based on the results of 26 clinical pharmacology studies. To support the current proposed indication four additional studies were conducted (1 phase II, 3 phase III). There are 6 ongoing Phase III and 1 ongoing Phase II randomized, controlled apixaban studies that will evaluate efficacy and safety in other indications (prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in AF, VTE treatment, secondary prevention of acute coronary syndrome and VTE prevention in subjects with acute medical illness).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GCP</head><p>The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. Page 19/62</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.2.">Pharmacokinetics</head><p>Apixaban is an orally active, direct, selective inhibitor of the coagulation factor Xa (FXa) that reversibly binds directly to the active site of FXa. The proposed dose in adults for prevention of VTE is 2.5 mg administered orally twice daily. The clinical pharmacology profile of apixaban has been characterized based on the results of 26 clinical pharmacology studies as well as population PK and exposureresponse analyses that incorporated data from Phase 1 and Phase 2/3 studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytical methods</head><p>All analytical methods fulfilled all current requirements and recommendations regarding linearity, precision, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Validation and analytical reports were submitted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Absorption</head><p> bioavailability</p><p>The C max of apixaban is reached approximately 3 to 4 h after dose administration. The absolute bioavailability of orally administered apixaban is approximately 52%. Apixaban appears to be absorbed primarily from the upper GI tract, proximal to the colon. Apixaban bioavailability was altered in the presence of CYP3A4 and P-gp modulators (see below). Apixaban was found to be a substrate for efflux transport proteins, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in vitro.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head> Bioequivalence</head><p>The comparative bioavailability study (CV185024) was conducted to further understand the performance of the Phase 2 wet-granulation tablet with respect to the Phase 3 dry-granulation tablet. It was shown that the results with the phase II tablets can be extrapolated to the phase III and commercial products. Additionally it was shown that small changes in dissolution rate seem not to affect the overall extent of absorption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Food interaction</head><p>The food interaction studies showed sufficiently that the apixaban phase II tablet has no clinical significant food interaction. Consistent with these results, apixaban is proposed for administration without regard to food.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distribution</head><p>Following an IV bolus dose, mean steady-state volume of distribution for apixaban was ~ 21 L. In human serum, in vitro protein binding was 87% at 0.46 g/mL, while protein binding in serum taken from humans following apixaban administration (apixaban concentrations of 0.068 to 0.22 g/mL) was ~93%. In vitro, binding of apixaban to 1-acid glycoprotein (9%) was less than its degree of binding to human serum albumin (66%). It is unlikely that saturation of binding or drug-drug interactions mediated by 1-acid glycoprotein binding will occur. The concentration of apixaban-related compounds in erythrocytes was less than that in plasma (blood:plasma ratio of 0.7 to 0.8).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Elimination and metabolism</head><p>Apixaban is eliminated by multiple pathways including metabolism, renal clearance and biliary clearance; nonclinical data suggest that direct intestinal secretion may also be involved. The mean total cumulative recovery over the 9-day period was approximately 77%. Of the TRA recovered in the urine, approximately 85% was apixaban parent and ~80% was recovered within 24 h after dosing. Recovery of TRA in the urine paralleled the disappearance of apixaban from plasma for that period. The TRA recovered in the faeces, concerned for the major part unchanged parent (~34%). Biliary excretion contributed to the elimination of apixaban and several metabolites. The radioactivity identified in biliary excreta during the 5-h collection window (approximately 5% of TRA recovery) suggested that fecal recovery consisted of both absorbed and unabsorbed drug since the fecal recovery of TRA was larger than that seen in bile. O-desmethyl apixaban sulfate (M1) was the major circulating metabolite. O-desmethyl apixaban sulfate does not have meaningful pharmacologic activity. Additional metabolites identified in plasma Page 20/62 included: O-desmethyl apixaban (M2), 3-hydroxy apixaban (M7), and hydroxylated O-desmethyl apixaban sulfate-1 (M10). The total radioactivity in circulation attributed to all 3 metabolites together was less than 3%. Metabolites accounted for approximately 25% of recovered TRA. The in vitro formation of O-desmethyl apixaban was primarily mediated by CYP3A4 and 3A5 with relatively minor contributions of CYP1A2 and CYP2J2; a low level of formation was catalyzed by CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Sulfate conjugation was mediated primarily by SULT1A1 with minor activity observed for SULT1A3, SULT1E1, and SULT2A1. The pharmacokinetics of O-desmethyl apixaban sulfate (M1), the major metabolite of apixaban was difficult to establish due to the low concentrations. The M1:apixaban ratio was consistent across dose groups ranging from 13 to 16%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dose proportionality and time dependencies</head><p>Apixaban exhibits linear PK dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg for the tablet formulation in healthy volunteers. Apixaban AUC(INF) increased in proportion to increases in IV dose from 0.5 to 5 mg. There was no indication of time-dependent pharmacokinetics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variability</head><p>Within-subject variability of apixaban PK parameters was approximately 20%. The between-subject variability in the exposure of apixaban was 30% to 40% for AUC parameters and independent of dose.</p><p>Inter-individual variability in PK parameters is slightly higher in patients (~40% CV).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers and patients</head><p>Based on pooled analysis of PO doses between 2.5 and 10 mg, the terminal T-half of apixaban is approximately 8-13 h. The shorter T-half observed following administration of PO doses &lt;2.5 mg may reflect the inability to fully characterize the terminal phase with an assay LLOQ of 1 ng/mL. No pharmacokinetics were measured in patients using full pharmacokinetic sampling. Apixaban PK in subjects who received apixaban for VTEp following TKR or THR are described by the population PK analysis. In general, the effect of intrinsic factors (age, gender, body weight, renal function) characterized in Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies accounted for the differences in exposure observed between the Phase 1 and Phase 2/3 study participants. In addition, surgery accounted for a transient 24% reduction in apixaban CLT/F in the first 3 days following surgery.</p><p>To date, apixaban has not been studied in pregnant or lactating women. The effects of smoking, diet composition, herbal products and alcohol use on the PK of apixaban have not been specifically studied in the apixaban development program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intrinsic factors</head><p>Mild to moderate hepatic impairment had no effect on apixaban PK or PD. However, representation of patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (based on Child-Pugh classification) in study CV185025 is limited, which is reflected in the SmPC. Higher apixaban exposures, up to approximately 30%, were observed for intrinsic factors such as age, female gender, or low body weight ( 50 kg).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacokinetic interaction studies</head><p>Based on nonclinical data, the potential for other drugs to affect apixaban exposure appear to be primarily related to the inhibition or induction of CYP3A4 and 3A5 metabolism and/or P-gp mediated efflux and represented the greatest potential for drug interactions involving apixaban.</p><p>Ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp) had the largest effect on apixaban PK (approximately 2-fold increase in exposure). Co-administration of apixaban with such agents is not recommended. Diltiazem, a less potent CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor, resulted in a 40% increase in apixaban exposure. Naproxen, an inhibitor of P-gp, resulted in an approximately 60% increase in apixaban exposure. Naproxen appeared to affect apixaban bioavailability via inhibition of P-gp mediated transport. Rifampin (a strong CYP inducer and P-gp inducer) reduced apixaban exposure by ~40% after IV administration and ~ 50% after PO administration; bioavailability was reduced 25% by rifampin. In light of the decrease in exposure following induction, care should be taken when administering apixaban with strong inducers of CYP enzymes or P-gp.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Page 21/62</head><p>Famotidine had no effect on apixaban pharmacokinetics. This indicates that apixaban PK are not likely to be altered by alterations in gastric pH or coadministration with organic cation transporter (OCT) inhibitors. Coadministration of enoxaparin with apixaban had no clinical significant effect on apixaban exposure.</p><p>Apixaban has little potential to affect the PK of other P-gp substrates based on the lack of effect on digoxin exposure, a commonly used P-gp substrate. In addition, in vitro data indicate that apixaban is not likely to alter the metabolism of other drugs. Apixaban did not influence pharmacokinetics of naproxen or atenolol. Based on a phase I study, no significant interaction between apixaban and aspirin or clopidogrel were seen on some bleeding parameters (see later for clinical experience). Therefore, the potential for apixaban to affect the PK of concomitantly administered medications seems to be low. Apixaban was found to be a substrate for efflux transport proteins P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). P-gp is also called ABCB1, ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1, and MDR1.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanism of action</head><p>Apixaban is an orally active, direct, selective inhibitor of coagulation factor Xa (FXa) that reversibly binds directly to the active site of FXa, and exerts anticoagulant and antithrombotic effects by diminishing the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig PD1)</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary and Secondary pharmacology</head><p>The PD effects of apixaban include inhibitory effects on FXa activity, the prolongation of clotting tests such as PT/INR, aPTT, and mPT, as well as ex vivo thrombin generation. The effect of apixaban on anti-Xa activity was assessed in multiple clinical trials with the Rotachrom® Heparin assay, covering a range of 2.5 to 20 mg. Concentration-related increases in anti-Xa activity were observed following administration of apixaban ( <ref type="figure">fig PD2)</ref>.</p><p>Page 22/62</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure PD2: Anti-Xa Activity vs Apixaban Plasma Concentration</head><p>Although apixaban does not require monitoring, the Rotachrom® Heparin assay is one available method to measure anti-Xa. The feasibility of this assay in clinical practice is discussed in the clinical section. Following administration of apixaban single PO doses of 2.5 to 50 mg, dose-related increases in International Normalised Ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) were observed.</p><p>Single doses of apixaban produced transient, dose-related changes in parameters of the thrombin generation curve, consistent with a direct factor Xa inhibitor. Such activity was evident over a 12 h dosing interval in line with the proposed dosing. Apixaban has no direct effect on platelet aggregation. The actual clinical implications when apixaban is co-administered with platelet aggregation inhibitors will be further discussed under safety.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary Pharmacology</head><p>Study CV185031 investigated the QT prolongation potential of apixaban in a thorough QT/QTc study. This is an appropriately designed study where administered doses were much higher than those proposed in the current indication (up to 50 mg compared to the proposed 2.5 mg BID).</p><p>The lower bound of the 95% CI for the placebo-adjusted change in QTcF after treatment with moxifloxacin was &gt;5 msec, confirming assay sensitivity. The upper bound of the 95% CI for the placebo-adjusted differences for both apixaban doses were &lt; 10 msec, indicating that apixaban had no relevant effect on the QTcF interval in contrast to moxifloxacin. This is further supported by pre-clinical studies showing that apixaban and Ο-desmethyl apixaban sulfate had negligible effects in the human related gene (hERG) and Purkinje-fiber assays (IC50 values &gt;30 μM), indicating a low probability for QT prolongation. Available data support that apixaban has no relevant effect on the QTc interval at concentrations exceeding those anticipated in patients who receive apixaban for VTEp following TKR or THR.</p></div>

Twice daily administration (2.5 mg BID) appears to be associated with a trend of better efficacy and lesser major bleeding events (0% versus 2.6% with the once daily administration of 5 mg) when exposure (AUC)-response is taken into account.</p><p>The administration of the first dose of apixaban post surgery (12-24 hours post-surgery) is not in line with the schedule of enoxaparin administration in EU, where the first dose is administered pre-surgery. On one hand the motivations for post-surgery application appear logical: observation of residual surgery-related bleedings before starting the anti-coagulant, also allows time for removal of indwelling epidural catheters used for neuraxial anesthesia. Both dabigatran (treatment should be initiated orally within 1 -4 hours of completed surgery with a single capsule and continuing with 2 capsules once daily thereafter) and rivaroxaban (6 to 10 hours after surgery) are also approved for post-surgery administration; but now apixaban allows even more delayed initiation. The possible implications of this delayed administration are further discussed under the results of the phase III studies.</p><p>Page 26/62</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.2.">Main studies</head><p>Three phase III studies are submitted to support the indication. Two of these studies CV185035 and CV185047 are considered the pivotal studies to support the VTEp in THR and TKR indications respectively, as they employed the EU regimen of enoxaparin (40 mg QD). The third study CV185034 is considered supportive as it employed the US regimen of enoxaparin (30 mg BID).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pivotal Studies</head><p> CV185035 and CV185047</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives</head><p>To compare the effect of apixaban 2.5 mg BID PO vs. enoxaparin 40 mg QD SC on the composite endpoint of adjudicated asymptomatic and symptomatic DVT, non-fatal PE, and all cause death at the end of the double-blind intended treatment period in subjects undergoing elective THR (CV185035) or TKR (CV185047).</p><p>The key secondary objective was to compare the effect of apixaban vs. enoxaparin on the composite endpoint of adjudicated proximal DVT, nonfatal PE, and VTE-related death (major VTE) at the end of the double-blind intended treatment period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p>The design of the clinical studies was comparable and is depicted in figure E4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure E4: Study Design -CV185035 and CV185047</head><p>This design is in line with studies previously submitted for the approval of other drugs for the same indications. The comparator enoxaparin is administered in the EU approved dose for VTEp both in TKR and THR, of 40 mg QD. The duration of prophylaxis of 35 and 12 days for the THR and TKR respectively is also in line with common practice guidelines. The direct comparator used in the trial is enoxaparin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study participants</head><p>The stated inclusion/exclusion criteria appear appropriate. The recruited populations in both studies suffered from some symptoms of CV co-morbidity, mainly hypertension. Around 20% of the patients had repeat surgery. Patients with previous VTE/PE were less represented (around 2%), which is acceptable. Differences in co-morbidity can be seen between the two pivotal studies, reflecting the older age group of the TKR study. Importantly, the distribution is balanced between the treatment groups in each study. Both ASA &gt; 165 mg/day as well as NSAIDs were not permitted pre-operatively.</p><p>Page 27/62</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcomes/endpoints</head><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of all adjudicated VTE (PE, symptomatic DVT, asymptomatic DVT) and all-cause death during the intended treatment period in subjects undergoing elective THR surgery (period includes first day of randomization and for treated subjects, the period ended at the later of a) 2 days after last dose of study drug or b) 38 days (THR) and 14 days (TKR) after the first dose (pre-or post-surgery) of study drug.</p><p>The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the composite of adjudicated asymptomatic and symptomatic proximal DVT, non-fatal PE, and VTE-related death during the intended treatment period in subjects undergoing elective THR/TKR surgeries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diagnosis:</head><p>For subjects with suspected symptomatic DVT during the treatment period, a physical examination and an ultrasound assessment of the symptomatic leg were performed. If diagnosis is positive, the study medication was discontinued and the subject was treated per the investigator's standard of care. If the ultrasound was inconclusive, bilateral ascending contrast venography was performed. If this was positive, the subject was managed as noted above. If the ultrasound and venogram were normal or indeterminate, the study medication and study schedule were continued. Bilateral ascending contrast venography at the end of study medication treatment was used to assess subjects who were asymptomatic for DVT. All VTE (DVT and PE) events and events leading to death were adjudicated by one independent, expert panel of physicians, for all 4 studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conduct of the studies</head><p>In study CV185035, the most important amendment was Amendment 4. The study sample size was subsequently increased from 4022 to 5406 to provide adequate power for the NI test for the primary efficacy endpoint (see before).</p><p>In study CV185047: After the results of CV185034 were known, the primary objective in CV185047 was changed from a superiority assessment to a NI assessment (prior to un-blinding) (amendment 5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Randomisation</head><p>Study Populations. In both studies, 8,464 subjects (4,236 on apixaban and 4,228 on enoxaparin) were randomized. Within each study, a similar proportion of randomized subjects completed the protocolspecified treatment period in both treatment groups <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(table E3)</ref>. The majority (61.6%) of randomized subjects in CV185035 and CV185047 were enrolled in Europe. The countries with the greatest proportions of randomized subjects were Russia (10.1%) and Ukraine (9.4%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baseline data</head><p>The subjects randomized in each study were representative of the population encountered in clinical practice. Both randomized groups appear well matched in each study. Most of the patients were white, with Asian representation more apparent in the TKR study. Patients &gt;75 are well represented in the TKR indication (around 19%), but less so in the THR study (around 12%), which probably also reflects the distribution in the target population. Patients with BMI ≥ 33 kg/m 2 were also adequately recruited (around 400 patients per treatment group in THR and more than 300 patients in TKR).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recruitment</head><p>It is not possible to classify the recruited patients based on the Child-Pugh classification of hepatic impairment as some parameters were not measured at baseline (albumin or Prothrombin Time). Spinal and general anaesthesia were used to a comparable extent in the THR and TKR studies. The proposed apixaban regimen is applicable for both types of anaesthesia. Post-operative utilization of NSAIDs in the main studies ranged from 52% till 71% and of ASA from 5.5% till 17.6%; comparable to previous studies in THR and TKR.</p><p>In study CV185035, apixaban was administered within 12 hours in around 10% of the patients, and within 12-24 hours in 85%. The corresponding figures in the TKR study were 6% and 89%. As mentioned earlier, the proposed timing of administration of apixaban is more delayed compared to the recently approved oral anti-coagulants. This is further discussed later.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Results</head><p>In both studies, apixaban resulted in significantly lower incidence of the primary efficacy endpoint (THR: 1.39%; TKR: 15.06%) compared to enoxaparin (THR: 3.86% and TKR: 24.37%) as shown in table (E5). In study CV185035, the upper bound of the 95% CI for RR was well below 1.25 (the NI margin for the risk ratio); therefore, the Non Inferiority (NI) criterion for the primary efficacy endpoint was met. In study CV185047, the upper bound of the 95% CI for risk difference was below 5.6% (the NI margin for the risk difference), and the upper bound of the 95% CI for RR was below 1.25 (the NI margin for the risk ratio); therefore, the NI criteria for the primary efficacy endpoint were met. The corresponding 1-sided p-values for both NI tests were &lt; 0.0001 <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(table E5)</ref>.</p><p>Page 29/62 In study CV185035 (THR), the event rates were 0.45% for apixaban and 1.14% for enoxaparin <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(table E6)</ref>. The observed RRR of apixaban vs. enoxaparin for the key secondary efficacy endpoint was 60%. In study CV185047, the event rates were 1.09% for apixaban and 2.17% for enoxaparin. The observed RRR of apixaban vs. enoxaparin for the key secondary efficacy endpoint was 50%.</p><p>In both studies, as NI for the key secondary efficacy endpoint was demonstrated, superiority of apixaban vs. enoxaparin on the primary efficacy endpoint was then assessed. The upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the RR was &lt; 1; therefore, superiority for the primary efficacy endpoint was demonstrated <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(table E6)</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intended Follow-up Period</head><p>Event rates for individual efficacy endpoints were low for both apixaban and enoxaparin during this 60day period. In study CV185035, no subject had a PE in the apixaban group vs. 4 subjects (0.16%) in the enoxaparin group. There were 2 deaths (0.08%) in apixaban and 1 death (0.04%) in enoxaparin group. In study CV185047, three subjects (0.21%) had a PE in the apixaban group (1 was a fatal PE) vs. 1 subject (0.07%) in the enoxaparin group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deaths and PE</head><p>Study CV185035. There were 5 deaths in the apixaban group and 2 deaths in the enoxaparin group during the entire study duration; the cause of death is as follows:</p><p>Apixaban -Intended Treatment Period: 3 deaths (1 VTE-related, 1 due to abdominal compartment syndrome, and 1 due to colonic neoplasm) -Intended Follow-up Period: 2 deaths (1 due to ileal perforation and 1 due to pancreatic cancer)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Enoxaparin</head><p>-Intended Treatment Period: 1 death (fat embolism) -Intended Follow-up Period: 1 death (stroke). The number of observed PE events (fatal and non-fatal) was smaller for the apixaban group (3) than the enoxaparin group (9) during the Intended Treatment and Follow-up Periods.</p><p>The one case of VTE-related death reported in the apixaban during the intended treatment period concerns a 73 years old Asian male. The patient died on day 9 with PE as the adjudicated cause of death. No diagnostic procedures were performed due to the rapidity of the subject's demise. No autopsy was performed. Per protocol all deaths including this one are adjudicated independently. The adjudication committee ruled this as a VTE-related death, since acute PE could not be excluded and the subject is included in the primary analysis. In the CSR, the efficacy listing reports the result of adjudication and therefore includes this subject as having had a VTE-related death; the listing of SAEs with outcome of death reports the SAE that led to death per investigator assessment and therefore includes this subject as having had a non-VTE related cause of death.</p><p>Study CV185047. There were 3 deaths in the apixaban group and 1 death in the enoxaparin group during the entire study duration; the cause of death is as follows:</p><p>Page 32/62</p><p>Apixaban.</p><p>-Intended Treatment Period: 2 deaths (1 VTE-related and 1 due to hepatitis, hyponatremia, aspiration of vomitus, and atrial fibrillation) -Intended Follow-up Period: 1 death (VTE-related)</p><p>Enoxaparin.</p><p>-Intended Treatment Period: none -Intended Follow-up Period: 1 death (major bleed <ref type="bibr">[retroperitoneal]</ref>). The number of observed PE events (fatal and non-fatal) was higher for the apixaban group (7) than the enoxaparin group (1) for the Intended Treatment and Follow-up Periods. However, the small number of events does not allow for a meaningful assessment of the effect of apixaban relative to enoxaparin on PE alone.</p><p>The one case of VTE-related death reported in the apixaban group during the intended treatment period concerns a 64 years old white female with history of ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure (CHF), and hypertension. She received her first dose of apixaban the day after surgery. The day after, she was diagnosed with cardio-pulmonary arrest with unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The autopsy revealed a right pulmonary artery embolism and a right lower extremity DVT. The subject had been fully compliant with study medication prior to the event.</p><p>The one case of VTE-related death reported in the apixaban group during the intended follow-up period concerns an 85 years old white female, with PE as the adjudicated cause of death. The subject died at home approximately 1 month after her last dose of study medication. No autopsy was performed.</p><p>In the THR (CV185035) study, results of the main secondary endpoints are mainly driven by the favorable results of proximal DVT (7 vs 20 cases in the apixaban and enoxaparin respectively). There is a numerical reduction in the events of non-fatal PE (2 vs 5 in the apixaban and enoxaparin respectively) but there was also one case of VTE-related death in the apixaban arm. Furthermore, in the follow-up period, PE and symptomatic proximal DVT were still recorded in numerically higher numbers in the enoxaparin (4 and 3 cases respectively) compared to none in the apixaban group. Considering the clinical importance of these endpoints, the benefit of apixaban in THR is considered demonstrated.</p><p>In the TKR (CV185047) study, analysis of the clinically significant endpoints represented in major VTE confirmed apixaban superiority, with the benefit mainly driven by the lower incidence of proximal DVT events (0.76% and 2.17% respectively). There is a numerically higher incidence of PE in the apixaban group (3 vs 0 respectively) in addition to one VTE-related death versus no events with enoxaparin. Results of the follow-up period show one extra case of VTE-related death, 2 cases of PE and 2 cases of symptomatic proximal VTE, versus 0, 1 and 1 case for enoxaparin respectively.</p><p>The duration of administration of apixaban in the TKR studies is in line with that used in other studies and in the relevant CHMP guideline. These recommendations are based on several clinical reviews investigating the benefit/risk of extended thromboprophylaxis in different orthopedic surgeries. In one meta-analysis, it was shown that patients who underwent THR tended to derive greater protection from symptomatic VTE using extended thromboprophylaxis (pooled OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.56; NNT, 62) than patients who underwent TKR (pooled OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.26 to 2.15; NNT, 250). Accordingly, the ACCP guideline <ref type="bibr">(Geerts et al., 2008)</ref> clearly recommends the extension of thromboprophylaxis beyond 10 days and up to 35 days after surgery in cases of THR (Grade 1A). However for patients undergoing TKR, the evidence of recommendation for the same extended duration is graded 2B.</p><p>In study CV185047, an equal number of patients (n=4) with PE were observed during each of the treatment periods and the follow-up periods (4:0 and 3:1 in the apixaban and enoxaparin groups respectively). The figures do not support that the duration of apixaban thromboprophylaxis was too short compared to enoxaparin. In summary, based on data from the apixaban dossier, it appears that the duration of administration of apixaban was adequate compared to enoxaparin for the recruited patients in these studies.</p><p>The missing or non-evaluable venograms rate recorded in the studies are on the higher limit recorded in previous studies, but are within the assumed rate in the statistical plan. Missing venograms were mainly due to subject refusal, however, another category "others" accounting for 13% of the missing cases was observed. The most frequent reason was due to discontinuation from the study or due to a Page 33/62 medical event (i.e. an adverse event not specified to be related to VTE, bleeding, stroke, or myocardial infarction). Importantly, these reasons appear balanced between the treatment groups.</p><p>Sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoints supports the robustness of the results. However, for the superiority of the secondary endpoints, sensitivity analysis is less robust, which can be attributed to the few events, as noted by the applicant. Subgroup analysis generally supported the overall results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supportive study</head><p>Study CV185034 was the first conducted phase III study in the indication of VTEp in the TKR. It follows the general design and endpoints of the previously presented pivotal studies, but can be considered only as supportive taking into account that the comparator enoxaparin was administered in a different dose regimen than that employed in EU. That is a dose of 30 mg BID starting 12-24 hours post-surgery, whereas in EU, it is administered as 40 mg QD with the first dose administered before surgery. So actually in this study, almost double the dose of enoxaparin is administered.</p><p>Results. The observed event rate for the primary efficacy endpoint for apixaban 2.5 mg BID (8.99%) was similar to that of enoxaparin 30 mg BID (8.85%) ( <ref type="table">Table E9</ref>). The study did not achieve the predefined statistical criteria for NI based on the CI for RR (RR = 1.02 with 95% CI of 0.78 to 1.32). The pre-specified NI criterion was based on meeting two conditions: (1) the upper bound of the 95% CI for the RR must not have exceeded 1.25 and (2) the upper bound of the 95% CI for the difference between event rates must not have exceeded 5.6%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table E9: Summary of Primary Efficacy Endpoint (Composite of All VTE/All-cause Death) During the Intended Treatment Period -Primary Efficacy Population</head><p>The applicant attributes this inability to show NI of apixaban to enoxaparin to the unexpectedly low event rate of enoxaparin. The sample size of the study was based on an event rate of total VTE/all cause death around 16% (reported in the phase II study CV185010 table E2), whereas the currently reported rate in the study was 8.85%. The applicant argues that this was the lowest recorded event rate for enoxaparin. This argument is accepted as in the study RE.MOBILIZE comparing dabigatran to enoxaparin 30 mg BID, results of enoxaparin on total VTE/all cause death were reported to be 25.3%, were higher than that reported in either TKR studies currently presented. Admittedly the standard of care could have improved through the time, but does not account alone for such a decrease in event rates.</p><p>The observed event rate for the key secondary efficacy endpoint was higher for apixaban (2.05%) than enoxaparin 30 mg BID (1.64%), but was not significant (p-value = 0.44)(   It should be noted that these are numerical increases and should be considered with caution. Of note, data submitted in previous regulatory submissions for other products, in the RE-MOBILIZE study, the approved dose of dabigatran was associated with 6 cases of PE (1%) versus 0 cases for the lower dose and 5 cases (0.7%) with enoxaparin. Also one case of VTE-related death was reported with dabigatran (0.2%) versus no cases reported with the lower dose or enoxaparin.</p><p>The applicant submitted a thorough analysis investigating the possible contributing factors to this higher incidence of PE in the apixaban group. The applicant did not specifically address the issue of duration of hospitalization. It can be agreed with the applicant that for the investigated risk factors in patient characteristics none can be identified that could be specifically attributed to this higher incidence of PE. The applicant did not specifically address the issue of duration of hospitalization. There was a higher incidence of total VTE reported in Russia/Ukraine which was attributed to the longer hospitalization period in these countries. However, this explanation can not hold when comparing the hospitalization period between studies CV185047 (mean 11 days) and showing a lower incidence of VTE events, compared to study CV185034 (mean 6 days). So, it can be concluded that duration of hospitalization does not per se play a major role in the incidence of VTE events.Regarding geographic location and medical practice, it can be agreed with the applicant that a higher diagnostic workup in US/Canada may have contributed to the higher reported incidence of PE in study CV185034 as shown in the table below.</p><p>Page 35/62</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment of Ascertainment Bias for PE -Randomized Subjects (Pooled CV185035, CV185047, CV185034 and CV185010)</head><p>However, this can not explain the imbalance noticed between the apixaban and enoxaparin arms, as it is a randomized study. In addition, the applicant brought forward a hypothesis that these early cases of PE could have been cases of fat emboli misdiagnosed as PE. This hypothesis is not supported, as these cases are supposedly adjudicated and the diagnosis is not solely based on the radiological findings.</p><p>Deaths: There were 3 deaths in the apixaban group and 6 deaths in the enoxaparin group during the entire study duration; the cause of death is as follows: Apixaban -Intended Treatment Period: 3 deaths (2 VTE-related, 1 due to myocardial infarction) -Intended Follow-up Period: none Enoxaparin -Intended Treatment Period: 3 deaths (1 bleeding, 1 atrial fibrillation, and 1 due to unknown cause) -Intended Follow-up Period: 3 deaths (2 VTE-related and 1 due to myocardial infarction).</p><p>The first case of VTE-related death concerns a 65 years old white female without history of cardiovascular disease randomized to apixaban 2.5mg BID. She had no apparent VTE risk factors other than the current orthopedic procedure. On the day after surgery, three hours after the first dose of study drug, she became hypotensive, hypoxemic and required mechanical respiratory support. She was diagnosed with cardiac arrest. Resuscitative measures were unsuccessful. An autopsy was performed and it revealed a PE.</p><p>The second case concerns a 66 years old white male, with PE as the adjudicated cause of death. Prior to the first dose of study medication, the subject became diaphoretic, short of breath, and hypotensive and was given volume resuscitation. The study drug was administered more than 24 hours after surgery. The PE event occurred the day after surgery (Day 1) and was confirmed by lung scan. The patient developed cardiopulmonary arrest and death occurred later the same day. No autopsy was performed.</p><p>Two cases of death were reported with enoxaparin during the intended follow-up period. One subject was a 72-year-old white female randomized to enoxaparin 30 mg q12h. She had a medical history of hypertension and a prior cerebrovascular accident and had BMI of 36 kg/m2. On study Day 1 (the day after surgery) she experienced hypoxemia, hypotension and respiratory difficulties leading to cardio-respiratory arrest. Blinded study drug was discontinued after this SAE. She was successfully resuscitated but had multiple complications including hypoxic encephalopathy and urosepsis. These complications led to a prolonged hospital course resulting in her death on Day 41. An autopsy was not done. The case was adjudicated as a VTE-related death since PE could not be excluded. The clinical presentation prior to death could also have been caused by other conditions such as fat embolism or cardiac arrest due to another cause. The other subject was a 78-year-old white female without significant cardiovascular disease history. She experienced a cardio respiratory arrest on study Day 1 (the day after surgery). Blinded study drug was discontinued after this SAE. During the event, she was hypotensive, hypoxemic and required endotracheal intubation due to respiratory failure. The etiology of the event was attributed to a PE, confirmed by spiral CT scan. The subject remained hospitalized. Her clinical course was complicated by septic shock, aspiration pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute renal failure (ARF). On Day 21, the subject had a second PE and died of its complications. The case was adjudicated per protocol and a VTE event resulting in death was confirmed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.3.">Discussion on clinical efficacy</head><p>Venous thromboembolism VTE is a common cause of morbidity and mortality following total hip replacement or total knee replacement surgeries. These events, which include distal deep venous thrombosis DVT, proximal DVT, clinical pulmonary embolism PE, and fatal PE, occur in 40%-80%, 10%-20%, 4%-10%, and 0.2%-5% of patients, respectively, when thromboprophylaxis is not used <ref type="bibr">(Geerts et al., 2008)</ref>. 1 PE is not the only serious consequence of DVT. Any episode of DVT significantly increases the risk of further VTE, and may also lead to a post-thrombotic syndrome that includes venous ulceration, debilitating pain, and intractable edema. Most clots that cause PE originate in the large veins of the legs. This is supported by the effectiveness of vena cava filters in the reduction of the incidence of PE in patients who have had recurrent VTE, but have contraindications for anticoagulation. PE is difficult to diagnose, expensive to treat, and often fatal. Therefore, the prevention of DVT represents the best strategy to decrease the morbidity and mortality of PE. The most effective methods for prevention of VTEp involve the use of anticoagulants in patients at risk. Several of the clinical situations that result in the highest risk of VTE are transient, such as those associated with major orthopedic or other surgeries or hospitalization for acute medical illnesses. For these situations, guidelines recommend short-term VTE prophylaxis that is most often achieved with parenteral anticoagulants. These agents include heparin, low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), and fondaparinux.</p><p>The most commonly used agents for VTEp are still the parenteral agents. These can be associated with local injection site hematomas. In addition, heparin and LMWH carry a low, but serious, risk of Page 42/62 thrombocytopenia. By their very nature, parenteral agents are less likely to be used properly after hospital discharge than simple PO regimens. Thus, there exists an unmet medical need for safe and effective agents that can be administered PO. In the setting of orthopaedic surgery, not all patients currently receive appropriate thromboprophylaxis because surgeons are concerned about the bleeding risks of available agents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choice of Endpoints</head><p>The chosen primary endpoint of the pivotal studies is not in line with the current CHMP guideline (CPMP/EWP/707/98 Rev.1 corr), whereas the key secondary endpoint is in fact the recommended primary endpoint in the CHMP guideline. All-cause death can also be part of the primary endpoint. It should be noted that the relevant CHMP guideline has itself undergone several changes in the past few years. The last revisions were meant to restrict the primary efficacy endpoint to the more clinically relevant DVT that is the proximal variety only (symptomatic or asymptomatic). However, this was later changed to the possibility to include distal symptomatic DVT as well. Thus, whereas the chosen primary endpoint can be considered too liberal as it includes asymptomatic distal DVT, the chosen secondary endpoint is conservative, as it excludes symptomatic distal DVT and asymptomatic distal DVT.</p><p>According to the applicant, aiming to show non-inferiority to enoxaparin based on the incidence of major VTE endpoint (excluding all distal DVT) would require large studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical methods</head><p>In study CV185035, initial sample size calculations over estimated the event rates (3.85% and 5.5% for apixaban and enoxaparin). Based on the results of the dabigatran studies, these estimations appeared realistic (event rates recorded of around 5%), though overestimated compared to rivaroxaban (1.1% to 3.7% respectively). A blinded event rate estimation of study CV185035 showed lower events rates, which necessitated increasing study sample size to provide adequate power for NI. This is accepted, as the estimation was blinded and was not made to detect efficacy. An estimated event rate of around 1% for secondary endpoints appears to be on the lower side (dabigatran study had an event rate of around 4%, while rivaroxaban had a range from 0.2% to 2%). The justification of the choice of the NI margin for both the primary endpoint and the main secondary endpoint is acceptable clinically.</p><p>In study CV185047, sample size calculations were based on event rates reported in study CV185010 (16% and 11 % for enoxaparin and apixaban respectively), which eventually appear to have been under-estimated (24% and 15 % respectively). The NI margin for the primary endpoint in the TKR studies appears appropriate. Setting a NI with another criterion based on the absolute risk difference is also conservative considering the possible difference in the event rates. Calculation of NI margin of 1.5 for the major secondary endpoint also appears clinically relevant and it is in line with that previously accepted for rivaroxaban.</p><p>Efficacy results shown in the THR (CV185035) study are mainly driven by the favorable results of clinically relevant endpoint. There is a numerical reduction in the events of non-fatal PE but there was also one case of VTE-related death in the apixaban arm. Furthermore, in the follow-up period PE and symptomatic proximal DVT were still recorded in numerically higher number in the enoxaparin compared to none in the apixaban group.</p><p>Benefit in VTE-p TKR is mainly based on study CV185047. Analysis of the clinically significant endpoints represented in major VTE confirmed apixaban superiority, with the benefit mainly driven by the lower incidence of proximal DVT events (0.76% and 2.17% respectively). However, this was associated with more numbers of PE cases in the apixaban group (n=4, with one fatal in intended treatment period and 3 in the intended follow-up period) compared to the enoxaparin group (0 in intended treatment period and 1 in the intended follow-up period). Thorough analysis of these cases did not show that any specific patient characteristic could have contributed to this higher incidence. The later initiation of either apixaban or enoxaparin was shown to be associated with a higher probability of total VTE, but not major VTE, but no robust conclusions can be made about the optimal timing of initiation; which should best be individualized. The posology also appears optimal.</p><p>In the supportive TKR study CV185034, the incidence of PE was even higher in the apixaban group. The only relevant explanation given about the higher threshold of clinical suspicion in US/Canada can only explain the higher diagnosis of PE in this study, but can not explain the higher incidence of PE in the apixaban group as it is a randomized study. By historical comparisons with the results of recently approved anti-coagulants, it could be observed that apixaban had higher incidences of PE and VT-related death. Enoxaparin on the other hand faired the best in the apixaban studies. This supports that these PE were chance findings. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Event Rates for PE and Symptomatic VTE During the Intended Treatment Period in Recent TKR Pivotal Trials with the EU Regimen of Enoxaparin as Comparator</head><p>In support that the higher PE incidence in the US study can be coincidental is that there was no associated higher incidence of all DVT in the apixaban group compared to enoxaparin (7.8% vs 8.2% respectively). Also the incidence of PE in the enoxaparin arm in the US study was higher (n=7; 0.44 %) than that in the EU study (0). In summary, apixaban results in VTE-related deaths in TKR are numerically higher compared historically to other anti-coagulants, whereas the results of enoxaparin are comparatively better.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient population</head><p>The pivotal studies excluded patients with severe renal impairment; this limited clinical experience is reflected in the SmPC. Based on PK data, the expected increase in exposure is not associated with an increased risk of bleeding.</p><p>Page 44/62</p><p>The excluded patients in the VTEp clinical program (patients with ALT/AST &gt; 2x ULN or total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x ULN) are reflected in the SmPC and eliquis should be used with caution in this population together with the need to measure ALT before apixaban administration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time of administration</head><p>Timing of initiation of apixaban administration which is more delayed compared to other oral agents was further investigated. Using a cut off of 18 hours from surgery, results show that the incidence rate of major VTE/all cause death is slightly lower in patients administered apixaban less than 18 hours after surgery (1.07%) compared to those administered apixaban more than 18 hours after surgery (1.21%). This difference is even more marked in the enoxaparin group (0.91% vs 2.65%) and even more exaggerated if incidence of all VTE is considered. Based on another analytical approach, it is shown that time from surgery to dose of apixaban was a significant independent predictor of the risk for All VTE and that for every additional hour from surgery to dose the odds of having All VTE increase by a factor of 1.027. This argues on one hand for the early use of the anticoagulant. On the other hand, the same analysis also showed that time from surgery to dose was not a significant predictor of the risk for major VTE/all-cause death which is the most relevant endpoint. This analysis applies for both apixaban and enoxaparin, therefore, can not explain the observed imbalance in PE. In the current ACCP guideline <ref type="bibr">(Geerts et al., 2008)</ref>, the advantages of pre-operative initiation of anti-coagulant therapy is even debated (current EU enoxaparin regimen). The applicant submitted further analysis of the VTE events in patients administered apixaban earlier than 12 hours after surgery. However, the numbers of these patients are too limited to draw any conclusions. Overall, these results support the general recommendations of initiating apixaban 12-24 hours after surgery. However considering the wide time frame of 12-24 hours and the potential impact between the benefits of delayed initiation (less bleeding) and the risks (thrombosis), it is considered useful to alert the physicians that the exact time of initiation should be individualized. This is implemented in the SmPC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.4.">Conclusions on the clinical efficacy</head><p>The benefit of apixaban in VTEp in patients undergoing THR and TKR is considered acceptable. No explanation can be given for the higher incidence of PE reported in the TKR studies, even after thorough analysis of possible patient characteristics or posology that could have contributed to this observation. Based on the current data analysis and compared to results of other anti-coagulants, it can be concluded that these PE were probably chance finding and they are mentioned in the SmPC section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">Clinical safety</head><p>Available safety information related to apixaban 2.5 mg BID in the indication of VTEp is based mainly on studies CV185035, CV185047, CV185034 and CV185010 (VTEp). Reference will also be made in certain sections to the available safety data from apixaban investigated in other indications (VTE treatment, secondary prevention in ACS, VTEp in metastatic cancer patients and AF). Exposure of patients in the ongoing studies CV185030, CV185048 and CV185036 is 14,456 (apixaban/warfarin), 4,592 (apixaban/aspirin) and 3382 (apixaban/enoxaparin) in the indications stroke-p in AF for the first 2 studies and VTEp in medically ill subjects in the third study respectively is high. Although this can add valuable safety information, its value is limited as the data is blinded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient exposure</head><p>The total number of subjects who received at least one dose of any double-blind study drug in the four VTEp studies was 12,742. Of these, 11,828 subjects received apixaban 2.5 mg BID (5,924) or enoxaparin 40 mg QD (4,167) or enoxaparin 30 mg BID (1,737). This exposure is considered adequate to characterize the safety profile of apixaban in this indication. The extent of exposure was similar in the apixaban and enoxaparin groups, both in the overall population and within subgroups. There were no treatment differences judged to be clinically relevant to the safety comparisons. The duration of exposure was bimodal due to the different target treatment durations by operative site (12 days for TKR and 35 days for THR). Approximately half of the subjects (46%) received study drug for 10 to 14 days, as per protocol for the 12-day studies in TKR, while 38% received study drug for 32 to 38 days, as per protocol for the 35-day study in THR.</p><p>Pooled data for all 4 studies, as well as for the pivotal studies is presented. Pooling of the 4 studies is considered acceptable considering that the same dose of apixaban was used. However, for comparative purposes with enoxaparin, such pooling may not always be appropriate considering that in the two Page 45/62 pivotal studies, enoxaparin was administered as 40 mg QD, and as 30 mg BID in the other studies. For brevity, only selected data will be presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse events</head><p>In the four pooled VTEp studies, the frequency of common AEs (reported for &gt; 1% of subjects in either treatment group) was similar in the apixaban and enoxaparin groups (apixaban 3812 [64%], enoxaparin 3936 [66.7%]) <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">(Table S3</ref>). AEs reported for &gt; 5% of subjects in the apixaban group were nausea (13.9% vs 15.5%), constipation (10.7% vs 12%), pyrexia (7.9% vs 8.2%), procedural pain (7.8% vs 8.1%), vomiting (6.7% vs 7.9%), peripheral edema (6.3% vs 6.5%), hypotension (5.7% for both), and dizziness (5.4% vs 4.7%) reported in the apixaban and enoxaparin groups respectively.

No SAE was reported for &gt; 1% of subjects in either treatment group.</p><p>During the treatment period, event numbers and rates of SAEs of DVT and PE in the apixaban vs. enoxaparin groups in each of the individual studies were as follows:</p><p>-CV185035: DVT 8 (0.3%) vs. 18 (0.7%); PE 3 (0.1%) vs. 7 (0.3%) -CV185047: DVT 11 (0.7%) vs. 22 (1.5%); PE 5 (0.3%) vs. 1 (&lt; 0.1%) -CV185034: DVT 6 (0.4%) vs. 10 (0.6%); PE 19 (1.2%) vs. 9 (0.6%) -CV185010: DVT 3 (1.9%) vs. 3 (2.0%); PE 2 (1.3%) vs. 2 (1.3%). During the follow-up period, serious events of DVT and PE were reported for 2 (&lt; 0.1%) subjects in the apixaban group and 8 [0.1%] subjects in the enoxaparin group. SAEs of DVT with onset during the follow-up period were reported for none of the subjects in the apixaban group and 5 (&lt; 0.1%) subjects in the enoxaparin group. SAEs of PE with onset during the follow-up period were reported for 2 (&lt; 0.1%) subjects in the apixaban group and 3 (&lt; 0.1%) subjects in the enoxaparin group. These SAE are previously discussed under efficacy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deaths:</head><p>Overall event rates for deaths in the pooled analysis of the four studies were low in both treatment groups with only numerical differences between treatment groups during the treatment period (apixaban 10/5924 [0.17%], enoxaparin 7/5904 [0.12%]). The event rates for death in the Page 46/62 apixaban group are consistent with rates reported during the treatment period in published reports of enoxaparin-controlled joint replacement studies (ranging from 0 to 0.3%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SAEs of PE with the outcome of death</head><p>were reported by the investigators for 5 (0.08%) subjects in the apixaban group and 1 (0.02%) subject in the enoxaparin group <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">(table S4)</ref>.

For other causes of death, the rate appears comparable between the treatment groups. Of these cases, 2 cases are considered relevant to the assessment of the benefit risk of apixaban. This includes one case of hepatitis, discussed below. The other 2 cases occurred in the enoxaparin group secondary to bleeding. The first case concerns a case of intracranial hemorrhage reported during the treatment period (TKR study: CV185034), the other concerns a case of retroperitoneal bleeding observed during the follow-up period (TKR study: CV185047).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table S7: Summary of Bleeding Endpoints During the Treatment Period -Treated Subjects (CV185035, CV185047 and CV185034)</head><p>No major bleeding events occurred in the apixaban 2.5 mg BID group or enoxaparin group in the Phase 2 study CV185010.</p><p>There was a comparable risk of bleeding during both the treatment and follow-up periods in the two pivotal studies CV185035/ CV185047 between apixaban and enoxaparin administered in the lower dose of 40 mg QD. Regarding major bleeding, in the THR study, major bleeding events were slightly higher in the apixaban group (0.82%) than the enoxaparin group (0.68%), in the TKR study, the opposite trend was observed (apixaban 0.6% and enoxaparin 0.98%). In study CV185034, in which enoxaparin was administered as 30 mg BID, the rates of major bleeding and the rates of the composite endpoint of major plus clinically relevant non-major bleeding were lower for apixaban than enoxaparin. For the major bleeding endpoint the 95% CI for the difference in event rates is &lt;0 but the p-value is &gt; 5%. This is due to the fact that different statistics were used to calculate the 95% CI and the p-value. The Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by type of surgery was used to calculate the p-value. The inverse variance or harmonic means method was used to calculate the 95% CI for the difference in event rates. These methods were pre-specified in the statistical methodology section.</p><p>Two fatal bleeding cases were reported in the enoxaparin group as discussed above. The bleeding profile of apixaban appears to be better compared to enoxaparin in the TKR studies. Analysis of causes of major bleeding in the three main studies revealed that most of the cases could be attributed to decrease in haemoglobin and transfusion of ≥ 2 units of packed red blood cells. Importantly bleeding hemarthrosis in operated joint resulting in re-operation or intervention was a rare event, with comparable incidence between apixaban and enoxaparin.</p><p>There is no general need to monitor apixaban. Routine monitoring is not considered feasible because both the efficacy and bleeding response curves are shallow across the range of exposures following 2.5 mg BID dosing. In addition, only one dose was investigated in the clinical studies and no dose adjustments are currently recommended in case of higher exposures. In cases of suspected overdose Page 51/62 or emergency surgery the commercially available Rotachrom anti-FXa assay may be useful to monitor bleeding.</p><p>During the assessment preliminary safety information of the Appraise II study was submitted. Clarification of the relevance of the safety bleeding events in Appraise II to the currently proposed indications was requested. APPRAISE II was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of Apixaban 5 mg BID compared to placebo in patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). Most patients (~80%) were administered apixaban on top of both ASA and clopidogrel. The study was prematurely stopped because of a higher bleeding risk observed in the Apixaban arm compared to the placebo arm (any bleeding of 17.4% vs. 7.6%). The bleeding risk difference was less noticeable in patients administered mono-antiplatelet therapy (9.7% vs 4.8%) and more in patients on dual anti-platelet therapy (19.4% vs. 9.3%). The additive effect of the three different agents on the bleeding risk is anticipated, but the exaggerated differences compared to the placebo support the decision to stop the study, especially because apixaban would usually be prescribed on top of the other agents in the ACS indication. The submitted preliminary data identified three factors that in particular increase this bleeding risk: age of the subjects (&gt;65 years), creatinine clearance (CrCL) at baseline (&lt; 60 ml/min), and type of antiplatelet therapy. It can be agreed with the applicant that the general results of APPRAISE 2 may not be directly relevant to the currently assessed application for VTEp, considering the doses used (5 mg BID vs 2.5 mg BID respectively). Also dual anti-platelet therapy administration is not expected to be as extensive, in the current indication. However, particularly relevant to the VTEp indication are the patients administered apixaban 2.5 mg BID because of reduced renal impairment (Cr CL &lt; 40 ml/min). The presented analysis included Cr Cl with a cut-off &lt;60 ml/min as a risk factor for increased bleeding; it is not clear in how many of these patients dose reductions were implemented and whether this had actually minimized the risk of bleeding. For clarity, only patients administered 2.5 mg BID are relevant to the current indication; for the group with identified higher risk= Cr Cl &lt;60 ml/min and those with Cr Cl between 40-60 ml/min did not have dose reductions and accordingly not directly relevant to the VTEp indication. However, the clinical experience in the VTEp studies in patients with severe renal impairment is limited.</p><p>In addition, as there is a much higher bleeding risk in patients &gt;65 years administered apixaban (20.7% vs 9.6% in placebo), it could have been informative to know if there was an associated renal impairment in these patients and if dose reductions were accordingly implemented. This analysis is recommended when final results of the APPRAISE II study will be submitted. Current results from this application indicate that elderly patients are a particularly high risk subpopulation, although it should be emphasized that this risk is mostly shown when co-administered with other anti-platelet agents. This high risk population is reflected in the current SMPC. It can be agreed with the applicant that monitoring anti-Xa activity would not have helped prevent the bleeding events in the study as this bleeding risk is a pharmacodynamic interaction; anti-Xa activity is not expected to be increased or to be able to predict a higher risk.</p><p>AEs of special Interest: Liver safety, MI, stroke, thrombocytopenia, and neurologic AEs.</p><p>Liver Safety. Thirteen cases of concurrent elevations of ALT &gt; 3 x Upper Limit Normal (ULN) and total bilirubin &gt; 2 x ULN are reported in the 4 placebo-controlled studies. Of the 8 cases reported with apixaban, causality was assessed as possible only in 2 cases (in another case, causality is not available). In two cases (including the one with causality not available) treatment was continued. In the third case, the outcome was fatal. The causality of the drug in this fatal case is possible, but the contribution of other concomitantly administered drugs can not be excluded.</p><p>In the 5 patients with reported SAE related to LFT, 4 were reported with apixaban, of which 3 causality is assessed as possible. One is the case of death reported above. In the second case, already an SAE of Grade II elevation of liver enzymes was reported prior to apixaban administration and no treatment was required. This precludes a firm conclusion regarding the relationship between further elevation of LFT and apixaban administration. The LFT elevations were reversible. In the third case, the possible cause of the LFT elevation is not clear; the causation by apixaban can not be excluded either. However, there was no concomitant bilirubin elevation; apixaban was not discontinued and the case was reversible without treatment. Hepatic safety data from 4 completed clinical studies in other indications (n=2547) showed a single case of concurrent elevations of ALT &gt; 3 x ULN and total bilirubin &gt; 2 x ULN reported with apixaban 20 mg QD group in study CV185027. This subject had underlying pancreatic cancer and a stent in the Page 52/62 common bile duct developed severe bacteremia leading to treatment interruption. Later apixaban was restarted and LFT decreased to within normal ranges while the subject was still on study drug. Blinded data from ongoing studies were also submitted (14,456 subjects have received apixaban 2.5 mg BID or warfarin for a mean of 41.3 weeks and 4,592 subjects received blinded apixaban 5 mg BID or aspirin for a mean of 31.4 weeks). Although of limited value as data is blinded the large patient exposure may still help in identifying potential toxicity.</p><p>Concerns were raised regarding an apparent imbalance in the pooled results of the European studies ADVANCE-2 and ADVANCE-3 for total bilirubin BRB &gt; 2xULN and also for the combination of AT &gt;3xULN plus BRB &gt; 2xULN (data based on the published clinical studies): • BRB &gt; 2xULN: Apixaban 1.02% (42 of 4136) vs. Enoxaparin 0.51% (21 of 4126); RR = 2.00 (95%CI: 1.19 to 3.35). • AT &gt;3xULN plus BRB &gt; 2xULN: Apixaban 0.31% (13 of 4136) vs. Enoxaparin 0.12% (5 of 4126); RR = 2.59 (95%CI: 0.96 to 6.98). The North-American ADVANCE-1 study showed the opposite trend in favour of apixaban. Only pooled data on AT &gt;3xULN plus BRB &gt; 2xULN were submitted without any discussion on the different rate of bilirubin elevations in the European and North-American studies. The main problem of pooling the safety data is that one can fail to detect heterogeneity in clinically important events between different trials that could be of clinical relevance. Clarification regarding this heterogeneity between the European studies (2-fold increase in bilirubin elevations x2ULN) and the North-American study (no increase) was further requested with clarification regarding baseline characteristics (i.e.: age, gender, race, renal or hepatic function) or pattern of concomitant medications or surgical/anaesthetic procedures that could explain the apparent higher risk of bilirubin elevations with apixaban in the European studies ADVANCE-2 and 3 compared with the North-American study ADVANCE-1. The submitted analysis shows that the observed imbalance was mainly an artifact due to the counting of cases of elevated LFT even before apixaban was administered.</p><p>Regarding the hepatotoxic potential of apixaban, the Hy's law which is the most acceptable method to identify drug induced liver damage was used. This identifies three criteria: a 3 fold or greater increase in ALT/AST compared to control drug or placebo, accompanied with elevations in TOTAL BRB to &gt;2xULN, without initial findings of cholestasis and after excluding other causes that could increase LFT. Based on these criteria, it can be concluded that there is no imbalance between apixaban and enoxaparin in the EU or the North American studies, during the post-surgery period and follow-up period: 3 vs 4 cases and 1 vs 1 respectively, whereas in the North American study, only one case was reported with enoxaparin. Additionally, applying Hy's law to clinical studies conducted with apixaban in other indications: CV185048 (exposure ~ 2700 patients to apixaban) and CV185023 (exposure ~ 1000 patients to apixaban), point to the same conclusions. In conclusion, it is considered that the above data do not support a hepatotoxic potential for apixaban.</p><p>Upon CHMP request, the applicant submitted also the narrative of the case: CV185030-836-9443, which is still blinded and no conclusions can be inferred. The applicant has committed to submit the information on the study medication of this patient as soon as it becomes available. (see letter of Undertaking).</p><p>Based on the above, the SmPC clearly identifies the limitations of the clinical studies and the recruited populations. As requested by the CHMP, the applicant included "transient elevation of liver tests" as an Identified Risk in the RMP, and will closely monitor "hepatotoxicity" in the post marketing period.</p><p>Regarding the risk of rebound thrombosis, during the treatment period, the incidence of MI appears balanced in the studies between the treatment groups. However, specifically in study CV185035, more cases of MI were observed in the apixaban group compared to enoxaparin during the treatment period (5 vs 3) and follow-up period (4 vs 1). However, there is no increase in MI during the Follow-up Period as compared to the Treatment Period for apixaban in this study CV185035 (4 MI and 5 MIs respectively) or in the combined CV185035, CV185047, CV185034 studies (7 MIs in the Treatment Period vs 5 in the Follow-up). The absence of an increase in MI during the Follow-up Period (which is a longer observation period) indicates that there is no evidence of either a rebound effect of anticoagulant discontinuation or the removal of effective antithrombotic therapy during a persisting sate of hypercoagulability. Accordingly, this is probably a chance finding. Results of Study CV185023 (a phase II study in patients with ACS) also provide reassuring data, as apixaban was even shown to reduce the risk of coronary artery thrombotic events. The risk of stroke or thrombocytopenia appears comparable between apixaban and enoxaparin.</p><p>Page 53/62</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neurologic AEs</head><p>Clinical neurological events became events of interest for apixaban after SAE reports were received for 1 case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 1 case of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) in the apixaban arm in a Phase 2 study for VTE prevention. Since then additional four cases of GBS and two cases of ALS have been reported in the programme with an exposure amounting to around 50,000 patients (apixaban/placebo/comparator). All cases of ALS had disease onset before starting study drug. Although the causality of apixaban to the reported cases of GBS and ALS did not appear likely (assessment confirmed by external neurology consultants), applicant was requested to unblind the cases reported with GBS or ALS in the ongoing development program of apixaban to allow adequate assessment of the benefit-risk balance.</p><p>The cases of GBS and ALS were distributed in both arms; there is no class alert or structural association between Factor Xa inhibitors and neurological disorders; the preclinical safety assessment did not show any evidence of toxicity in central or peripheral nervous system; therefore there is no evidence that these cases are associated to the study treatment and the cases more likely occurred at random. All the same, enhanced surveillance is ongoing across the Phase 3 apixaban clinical program for neurological adverse events, and the applicant will have to provide cumulative reviews of GBS and ALS cases in PSURs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety in special populations</head><p>No clinically relevant differences were noted in the event rates for bleeding between apixaban and enoxaparin groups within subgroups in the 2 pivotal studies. Neither intrinsic factors (age, gender, weight, BMI, level of renal impairment, number of risk factors for VTE, or type of surgery [unilateral or bilateral THR or TKR]), nor extrinsic factors (geographic region) appeared to have an impact on the bleeding profile of apixaban relative to enoxaparin observed overall in these studies.</p><p>Results from studies in other indications (study CV185068 in ACS) showed an increased bleeding risk in patients co-administered apixaban, ASA and clopidogrel. This risk was more in elderly patients &gt;65 years and patients with CrCL&gt; 60 ml/min. Most of the recruited patients were White (~86%) or Asian (~10%). Additional discussion on the efficacy and safety in different races groups was provided and did not raise any concerns. However since this is limited information from other ethnic groups (black ~ 2%); no firm conclusions about efficacy and safety in these groups can be drawn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions</head><p>Post-operative utilization of NSAIDs in the main studies ranged from 52% till 71% and of ASA from 5.5% till 17.6%, comparable to previous studies in THR and TKR. Results suggest a comparable bleeding risk of co-administration of apixaban compared to enoxaparin, sometimes even more favourable. Regarding the combined administration of aspirin, clopidogrel and apixaban, the available PK data did not show a relevant increase in template bleeding time, platelet aggregation, or clotting tests (PT, INR, and aPTT) compared to administration of these antiplatelet agents without apixaban. However, results from clinical experience in phase II and III studies in ACS patientsshow that a higher bleeding risk in such patients can not be excluded. The use of apixaban also is not recommended in patients receiving concomittant systemic treatment with strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp. These interactions are reported in the SmPC. </p></div>

The duration of exposure is also in line with the specified guidelines.</p><p>Overall, results indicate that the adverse events and the treatment related adverse events profile of apixaban are comparable to that of enoxaparin.</p><p>The overall frequency of serious adverse events with onset during the treatment period and the followup period in the four pooled VTEp studies was similar in the apixaban and enoxaparin groups. No SAE was reported for &gt; 1% of subjects in either treatment group. The most frequently reported SAEs in both groups were DVT and PE, which are further discussed under efficacy.</p><p>Overall event rates for deaths were low in both treatment groups with only numerical differences between treatment groups during the treatment period. The event rates for death in the apixaban group are consistent with rates reported during the treatment period in published reports of enoxaparin-controlled joint replacement studies (ranging from 0 to 0.3%).</p><p>Adjudicated cases of PE and fatal PE are discussed under efficacy. Death related to other causes with onset during the treatment period or the follow-up periods was reported in comparable distribution between apixaban and enoxaparin groups.</p><p>The bleeding profile of apixaban in both THR and TKR is considered acceptable. There was a numerical increase in major bleeding in the apixaban arm in the THR and the opposite trend in the TKR study. Compared to the higher dose of enoxaparin, a trend of lower risk of major bleeding was observed in favor of apixaban and a significant reduction in the risk of the composite of major/(clinically relevant non major (CRNM) bleeding. Two fatal bleeding cases were reported in the enoxaparin group.</p><p>Current clinical data do not support a hepatotoxic potential of apixaban. There is numerical increase of LFT compared to enoxaparin, and causality was assessed as possible in 2 cases, one of them was fatal. The causality of the drug in this fatal case is possible, but the contribution of other concomitantly administered drugs can not be excluded. Data from 4 completed clinical studies in other indications (n=2547) revealed another case of elevated LFT, which could be confounded by multiple co-morbidities. Blinded data from ongoing studies suggest that apixaban is unlikely to be hepatotoxic. Clarification was provided regarding imbalance between EU and US studies which did not support a hepatotoxic potential for apixaban at present. The SmPC clearly identifies the limitations of the clinical studies and the recruited populations. Furthermore, "Transient elevation of liver tests" are included as an Identified Risk in the RMP and "hepatotoxicity" will be closely monitored in the post marketing period.</p><p>No clinically meaningful differences were noted in the frequencies of clinical laboratory test results for the apixaban and enoxaparin groups in any of the analysis periods.</p><p>No clinically relevant differences were noted in the event rates for bleeding between apixaban and enoxaparin groups within patients subgroups. There is limited experience in patients with severe renal impairment which is reflected in the SmPC. Analysis based on different degrees of hepatic impairment is not submitted as some parameters of the Child-Pugh scale were not measured as baseline. A cautionary remark is included about the exclusion of patients with elevated liver enzymes, and the need to perform ALT prior to administration for adequate risk management. Based on PK data, bleeding parameters appear not be significantly affected in patients concomitantly administered apixaban and other drugs especially platelet aggregation inhibitors and NSAIDs. However, clinical experience is different and is reflected in the SmPC.</p><p>Preliminary results from study CV185048 (stroke prevention in AF patients) which was prematurely discontinued because of efficacy were submitted upon CHMP request. The event rates for bleeding are higher for apixaban than ASA but these are based on a pool analysis of mixed doses of apixiban (5 mg BID and 2.5BID) and ASA <ref type="bibr">(81,</ref><ref type="bibr">162,</ref><ref type="bibr">243</ref> or 324 mg QD).</p><p>Additional information received from cases of GBS and ALS did not show evidence of neurotoxicity since they were equally distributed in both arms and additional predisposing risk factors for GBS/ALS in the underlying medical/surgical conditions were present. There is no class alert or structural association between Factor Xa inhibitors and neurological disorders and the preclinical safety assessment did not show any evidence of central or peripheral neurotoxicity.</p><p>Page 55/62</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.2.">Conclusions on clinical safety</head><p>Safety profile of apixaban in VTE-p in THR and TKR appears to be comparable to that of enoxaparin, with a bleeding profile that appears favourable compared to the higher dose of enoxaparin. The most frequent observed adverse reactions are anaemia, haemorrhage, nausea and contusion.</p><p>Based on the current clinical and pre-clinical data, the hepatotoxic potential of apixaban is not supported. Because "Transient elevation of liver tests" were reported, this is included as an Identified Risk in the RMP and "hepatotoxicity" will be closely monitored in the post marketing period.</p><p>The SmPC clearly identifies the limitations of the clinical studies and the recruited populations: ELIQUIS is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk (see section 4.3). It is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections <ref type="bibr">4.4. and 5.2)</ref>.</p><p>It should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment <ref type="bibr">(Child Pugh A or B)</ref>. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).</p><p>Patients with elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST &gt;2 x ULN) or total bilirubin ≥1.5 x ULN were excluded in clinical trials. Therefore Eliquis should be used with caution in this population (see sections <ref type="bibr">4.4 and 5.2)</ref>. ALT should be measured as part of the standard pre-operative evaluation (see section 4.4).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefits</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Beneficial effects</head><p>In Total Hip Replacement (THR) study (CV185035), apixaban demonstrated a significant superiority to enoxaparin for the primary efficacy endpoint (composite endpoint of all VTE/all-cause death). The point estimate was 1.39% vs. 3.86%; p &lt; 0.0001, relative risk reduction [RRR]: 64% -95% CI = 0.22, 0.54). More importantly, this superiority was demonstrated also on major VTE (proximal DVT, nonfatal PE and VTE-related death). Reported event rates were 0.45% vs. 1.14%; p=0.0107, RRR: 60% -95% CI = 0.15, 0.80. Results of the main secondary endpoints are mainly driven by the favorable results of proximal DVT (7 vs 20 cases in the apixaban and enoxaparin groups respectively). There is a reduction in the events of non-fatal PE (apixaban(2) and enoxaparin <ref type="formula">(5)</ref>) but there was one case of VTE-related death in the apixaban arm. In the follow-up period, PE and symptomatic proximal DVT were recorded in higher numbers in the enoxaparin (4 and 3 cases respectively) compared to none in the apixaban group. A benefit of apixaban in THR over the standard comparator was considered adequately proven.</p><p>In Total Knee Replacement (TKR) study (CV185047), superiority of apixaban was also shown over enoxaparin in the primary endpoint (15.06% vs. 24.37%; 2-sided p-value &lt;0.0001, RRR: 38%; 95% CI = 0.51, 0.74) as well as the secondary endpoint (1.09% vs. 2.17%; p-value=0.0373, RRR: 50% -95% CI = 0.26, 0.97). This superiority is not only driven by the incidence of distal DVTs (14.52 % and 23.9% respectively), but also the clinically relevant proximal DVT events (0.76% and 2.17% respectively).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects</head><p>The superiority demonstrated by apixaban over enoxaparin in TKR was associated with an increase in PE (3 vs 0 respectively) and one VTE-related death versus no events with enoxaparin. Results of the follow-up period show one additional case of VTE-related death, 2 cases of PE and 2 cases of symptomatic proximal VTE in apixaban arm versus 0, one and one case for enoxaparin respectively.</p><p>In the TKR supportive US study, in which enoxaparin was administered as 30 mg BID, non-inferiority of apixaban against enoxaparin was not reached. Importantly, here also an increase in PE in the apixaban group (n=14; 0.88%) was observed compared to the enoxaparin group (n=7; 0.44%).</p><p>There was an increase in VTE-related deaths in the apixaban arm in TKR (1 and 2 cases in the EU and US studies respectively) compared to none with enoxaparin. Three major issues were explored as possible contributory factors to the higher incidence of events above described: patient characteristics, timing of initiation of apixaban and the posology. Patient characteristics (risk factors, compliance, coadministration of other drugs) were balanced and where not considered by the CHMP as influential. Geographical location/medical practice probably had an effect on the higher incidence of PE reported in the US/Canada study compared to the EU study, but could not explain the higher incidence of PE in the apixaban compared to enoxaparin in the same study. Duration of hospital stay was also longer in the EU study than in the US, with better results in the EU study, precluding the duration of hospital stay to be of importance in the current assessment. The duration of thromboprophylaxis used in the TKR studies are in line with previously performed studies and CHMP guideline. However, in some patients an extension of prophylaxis beyond 14 days could have been beneficial to prevent the cases of PE reported in the follow up period. This is also in line with the most recent ACCP guideline <ref type="bibr">(2008)</ref> and applies also to all other antithrombotics. The time of initiation of apixaban is more delayed than other anti-coagulants. Presented data suggest that for both apixaban and enoxaparin delayed initiation of administration is associated with higher risk for total VTE, but not major VTE. The advantages of delayed initiation should probably be individually balanced against the VTE risk per agent used.</p><p>Page 59/62</p><p>In conclusion, the CHMP was of the opinion that this increase of PE events was probably chance findings. This can be further supported by the observation that this increase of PE was isolated, without a comparable increase in the incidence of DVT. This is not a likely event, considering that most PE events originate from the leg veins. In addition, the reported incidence of PE in the enoxaparin arm in the EU study was lower (0.07%) than the US study (0.44%), which is counterintuitive, considering the doses of enoxaparin used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risks</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unfavourable effects</head><p>Available safety information related to apixaban 2.5 mg BID in the indication of VTEp was considered adequate (n=5,924) to characterize the safety profile of apixaban in this indication. The duration of exposure is also relevant to the indication.</p><p>Overall, results indicate that the adverse events and treatment emergent adverse events profile of apixaban was similar to that of enoxaparin. The overall frequency of SAEs with onset during the treatment period and the follow-up period in the four pooled VTEp studies was similar in the apixaban and enoxaparin groups (392 [6.6%] and 396 [6.7%], respectively in the treatment period and in the follow-up period: 46 [0.8%] and 49 [0.9%] respectively. No SAE was reported for &gt; 1% of subjects in either treatment group. The most frequently reported serious adverse events were deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.</p><p>Overall event rates for deaths were low in both treatment groups with only numerical differences between treatment groups during the treatment period (apixaban 10/5924 [0.17%], enoxaparin 7/5904 [0.12%]). The event rates for death in the apixaban group were consistent with rates reported during the treatment period in published reports of enoxaparin-controlled joint replacement studies (ranging from 0 to 0.3%).</p><p>Fatal PE was reported by the investigators for 5 (0.08%) subjects in the apixaban group and 1 (0.02%) subject in the enoxaparin group. Of these deaths, 4 events in the apixaban group and 1 event in the enoxaparin group were confirmed by adjudication.</p><p>The rate of death related to other causes was comparable between the treatment groups during the treatment period (apixaban 5, enoxaparin 6) and the follow-up period [apixaban 3 and enoxaparin 2].</p><p>There was a comparable risk of bleeding during both the treatment and the follow-up periods in the two pivotal studies between apixaban and enoxaparin administered in the lower dose of 40 mg QD, with major bleeding events slightly higher in the apixaban group in the THR study (0.82% vs 0.68%) and slightly lower in the TKR (0.6% vs 0.98%). In study CV185034, in which enoxaparin was administered as 30 mg BID a trend of lower risk of major bleeding was observed in favor of apixaban (adjusted difference of event rates -0.81%; p: 0.0533) and a significant reduction in the risk of the composite of major/clinically relevant non major bleeding (-1.46%; p=0.0338). Two fatal bleeding cases were reported in the enoxaparin group. The bleeding profile of apixaban appears to be better compared to enoxaparin in the TKR studies.</p><p>No clinically meaningful differences were noted in the frequencies of clinical laboratory test results for the apixaban and enoxaparin groups in any of the analysis periods.</p><p>No clinically relevant differences were noted in the event rates for bleeding between apixaban and enoxaparin groups within patients subgroups. Results suggest a comparable bleeding risk of coadministration of apixaban with NSAIDs compared to enoxaparin, sometimes even more favourable.</p><p>The rate of discontinuation due to AEs from the clinical studies was comparable between the treatment groups in the 4 studies (apixaban 200 [3.4%], enoxaparin 217 [3.7%]), with DVT and PE as the most common AEs leading to discontinuation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects</head><p>Analysis of clinical and pre-clinical data did not support a hepatotoxic potential of apixaban. Actual representation of patients with different degrees of hepatic impairment in the current studies was not known, but patients with elevated liver enzymes were excluded in the clinical trials. This was clearly identified in the SmPC together with the need to measure ALT before administration. The incidence of Page 60/62 concurrent elevations of ALT &gt; 3 x ULN and total bilirubin &gt; 2 x ULN was numerically higher with apixaban (n=8) than that reported with enoxaparin (n=5), and causality was assessed as possible in 2 apixaban cases, one of them was fatal. The causality of the drug in this fatal case was possible, but the contribution of other concomitantly administered drugs could not be excluded. Data from four completed clinical studies in other indications (n=2547) revealed one case of ALT &gt; 3 x ULN and total bilirubin &gt; 2 x ULN, which can be confounded by multiple co-morbidities. Blinded data from ongoing studies suggested that apixaban is unlikely to be hepatotoxic. "Transient elevation of liver tests" was included as an Identified Risk in the RMP, and "hepatotoxicity" will be closely monitored in the post marketing period.</p><p>Apixaban, clopidogrel and ASA were co-administered in clinical studies in patients with ACS. Results show an increased bleeding risk in these patients, particularly in elderly patients and patients with CrCl &lt; 60 ml/min. These risks were reflected in the SmPC.</p><p>Routine monitoring of apixaban is not needed. However, in cases of overdose or emergency surgery, the commercially available Rotachrom assay can be used. This was reflected in the SmPC.</p><p>Further safety data from the completed/ongoing studies should be submitted to facilitate the assessment of the safety profile of apixaban.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Balance</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects</head><p>In the indication of VTEp in THR, apixaban showed favourable results that were considered by the CHMP both statistically significant as well as clinically relevant compared to enoxaparin.</p><p>The risk of bleeding was considered comparable to that of enoxaparin, with a slightly higher number of major bleedings</p><p>In the indication VTEp in TKR, apixaban also showed favourable results against enoxaparin in the pivotal study. In the supportive study, non-inferiority NI against enoxaparin was not achieved. The favourable results in the pivotal study were considered more relevant to the EU population, in particular taking into account the dose of enoxaparin used.</p><p>The higher incidence of PE and to a lesser extent VTE-related death in the apixaban group, could not be explained based on the explored patient characteristics or apixaban posology. Based on the current knowledge and compared to other studies, this higher PE incidence was considered by the CHMP to be probably a chance finding.</p><p>Bleeding risk appeared to be comparable if not better than enoxaparin. In the pivotal study, there were fewer major bleeding events in the apixaban group compared to enoxaparin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit-risk balance</head><p>Based on the above data, the beneficial effects of apixaban outweigh the unfavourable results in VTEp in both THR and TKR. Apixaban administration was associated with better efficacy in terms of superior reduction of the clinically relevant events of VTE compared with enoxaparin. This was accompanied with a comparable bleeding risk (main results are depicted in the figure below).</p></div>

Further analysis did not show that patient characteristics or apixaban posology could have significantly contributed to these cases. Comparing the current results with those of other anti-coagulants, from previously conducted studies, this higher PE incidence could be considered by the CHMP to be a chance finding and this was reflected in the SmPC. Time of initiation of apixaban is delayed compared to other agents, which probably ensures a better bleeding profile, however this advice could be better individualized. Current data did not point to a hepatotoxic potential for apixaban. Safety data from the ongoing studies should be submitted to facilitate further assessment of the safety profile for apixaban.</p></div>

The SmPC currently contains adequate warnings for subgroups who may have higher risk for bleeding due to PK or PD interactions, in particular patients administered strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, or platelet inhibitors, patients with moderate and severe renal impairment and elderly patients.
