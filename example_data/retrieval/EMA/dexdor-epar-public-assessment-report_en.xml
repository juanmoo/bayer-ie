<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Introduction</head><p>Dexdor is a concentrate for solution for infusion and contains 118 µg /ml of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride equivalent to 100 micrograms/ml of dexmedetomidine. Three presentations of the finished product are available: 200 µg/2 ml ampoules, 400 µg/4 ml and 1000 µg/10 ml single-use vials. The container closure system for 2 ml nominal fill volume is type I colourless glass ampoules.</p><p>The other containers (4 ml and 10 ml nominal fill volumes) are type I colourless glass vials with two alternative fluoropolymer coated bromobutyl rubber stoppers (omniflex plus and ETFE), sealed with aluminium seals and polypropylene flip-off caps.</p><p>The other ingredients of this medicine are water for injections and sodium chloride.</p><p>Dexdor must be administered only as a diluted intravenous infusion using a controlled infusion device.</p><p>Compatible admixture fluids and administration devices/bags have been investigated and use-times and storage conditions for diluted solutions for infusion have been established.</p><p>Dexdor can be diluted in glucose 50 mg/ml (5%), Ringers, mannitol 200 mg/ml (20%) or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to achieve the required concentration of 4 micrograms/ml prior to administration. Dexdor has been shown to be compatible when administered with the following intravenous fluids and medicinal products: Lactated Ringers, 5% glucose solution, sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection, mannitol 200 mg/ml (20%), thiopental sodium, etomidate, vecuronium bromide, pancuronium bromide, succinylcholine, atracurium besylate, mivacurium chloride, rocuronium bromide, glycopyrrolate bromide, phenylephrine HCl, atropine sulphate, dopamine, noradrenaline, dobutamine, midazolam, morphine sulphate, fentanyl citrate, and a plasma-substitute.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Active Substance</head><p>The chemical names of dexmedetomidine are 1H-imidazole, 4-[1-(2,3-dimethylphenyl)ethyl]-, (S)-, hydrochloride, or (+)-4-[(S)-α,2,3-trimethylbenzyl]-imidazole hydrochloride, corresponding to the molecular formula C 13 H 16 N 2 .HCl. The structure of this active substance is described in figure 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1: Dexmedetomidine hydrochloride</head><p>It appears as an almost white, or white, crystalline powder that is freely soluble in water, chloroform, ethanol and methanol; slightly soluble in acetonitrile and practically soluble in ethe. Dexmedetomidine has one chiral centre and is therefore optically active. During the synthesis only one (S)-enantiomer is manufactured and used in the manufacture of the finished product. There are two recognised </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.2.3.1.</head><p>polymorphic forms of dexmedetomidine: anhydrous (form A) and monohydrate (form B). Form A is consistently obtained during synthesis and is used in the manufacture of the finished product.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacture</head><p>The Active Substance Master File (ASMF) procedure was followed for the active substance. The manufacturing process of dexmedetomidine is a three step synthesis followed by purification (filtration and crystallisation). A full description of the synthetic route was provided in the restricted part of the ASMF. Adequate controls of critical steps and intermediates are in place to ensure the quality of the active substance, and adequate specifications for starting materials, reagents, and solvents have been provided. The purified active substance is packed in white polyethylene containers that are sealed within aluminium laminate bags. Statements from the Qualified Persons of the finished product manufacturers confirming that the manufacturing of the active substance is performed in compliance with current EU GMP or ICH Q7A were provided. The chemical structure of the active substance has been confirmed by spectroscopy (IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, UV and MS). In addition the molecular weight was determined by elemental analysis and the absolute configuration and crystal structure was determined by X-ray diffraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specification</head><p>The active substance specification as tested by the finished product manufacturer includes tests for appearance (visual), identification (IR, chlorides and HPLC), loss on drying (Ph.Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph.Eur.), heavy metals (Ph.Eur.), pH, colour of solution (Ph.Eur.), clarity of solution (Ph.Eur.), optical purity (Ph.Eur.), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), assay (HPLC) and microbiological purity (Ph.Eur.). A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Full method validation data was provided for the in-house analytical methods and are in accordance with the relevant ICH guidelines. In general, the analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the active substance. The impurity limits are acceptable and there is no concern from the point of view of safety.</p><p>Batch analysis data have been provided and show compliance with the predefined active substance specification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability</head><p>The stability results from long-term (25°C/60%RH) for 6 production scale batches and accelerated studies (40°C/75%RH) for five production scale batches were completed according to ICH guidelines demonstrated adequate stability of the active substance. The following parameters were monitored during the stability studies: appearance (visual), loss on drying, assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC) and optical purity (HPLC), employing the test methods applied as used for release of the active substance.</p><p>It can be concluded that the proposed re-test is justified based on the stability results when the active substance is stored in the original packaging material.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmaceutical Development</head><p>All information regarding the choice of the drug substance characteristics and the excipients are sufficiently justified. The excipients selected for this formulation are commonly used in pharmaceutical formulations and are described in the European Pharmacopeia. The main objective was to develop a stable, sterile, aqueous solution of dexmedetomidine hydrocloride for intravenous administration. Since it is freely soluble in water at room temperature, it was possible to develop a final formulation of a homogenous solution at the proposed concentration (100 µg/ml). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.2.3.4.</head><p>product was considered and studied during drug development. The vials are sealed with coated butyl rubber stoppers. Since the product is intended for single use only, no preservative system has been considered. The manufacturing process employed is simple and has not changed significantly during product development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacture of the product</head><p>This Manufacturing process consists of the following steps: mixing and dissolution of ingredients, filtration, filing, terminal sterilization, inspection of ampoules/vials, assembly process (labeling and packaging).The critical steps of this particular manufacturing process have been identified and optimised during drug development.</p><p>Satisfactory process validation data have been provided for the major steps of the manufacturing process. The batch analysis results show that the medicinal product can be manufactured reproducibly according to the agreed finished product.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Product specification</head><p>The product specification is standard for concentrate for solution for infusion and contains tests with suitable limits for colour of solution (Ph.Eur), clarity of solution (Ph.Eur), particulate matter (Ph.Eur), extractable volume (Ph.Eur), pH (Ph.Eur), identification of dexmedetomidine (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), optical purity, impurities (HPLC), assay of sodium chloride, test for sterility (Ph.Eur) and</p><p>bacterial endotoxins (Ph.Eur). Impurities and degradation products have been evaluated and found to be acceptable from the point of view of safety. All analytical procedures that were used for testing the finished product were properly described and satisfactorily validated in accordance with the relevant ICH guidelines. The batch analysis data for 5 production scale batches confirm that the concentrate for solution for infusion can be manufactured reproducibly according to the agreed finished product specifications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability of the product</head><p>Stability studies under ICH long-term and accelerated conditions (i.e. 25°C/60% RH and 40°C/75% RH) have been carried out for pilot and production batches covering all three proposed presentations (200 µg/2 ml, 400 µg/4 ml and 1000 µg/10 ml).</p><p>The results of the following tests were submitted: appearance (colour and clarity of solution), impurities, assay, pH, microbiological purity (Ph.Eur) and optical purity. The analytical methods used for the stability studies are identical with the methods proposed for routine testing of the finished product. During the stability studies the product did not show any significant change in its quality. All the results remained well within the specification limits during all the stability studies.</p><p>A Photostability testing program was conducted in accordance with the recommendations of ICH guideline Q1B. The results were found to meet the specifications and the finished product does not require any special light protection.</p><p>The stability of Dexmedetomidine 100 μg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion has been evaluated on repeated freezing and thawing. The freeze-thaw study of Dexmedetomidine 100 μg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion was carried out by storing 2 ml ampoules in a freezer at approximately -20 °C at least for 24 hours. Freezing and thawing was carried out four times. All results complied with the specification confirming that repeated freezing and thawing does not have an impact on the quality and stability of the finished product.</p><p>Dexdor Assessment report Page 11/79</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.2.4.1.</head><p>During the development work the stability and compatibility studies of the diluted solutions of Dexmedetomidine 100 μg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion in different infusion solutions have been investigated. Stability of the drug product after dilution in 0.9 % sodium chloride infusion solution to concentration 4 μg/ml has been demonstrated for 48 hours. Drug product has also been studied to be stable in dilutions with 5 % glucose (dextrose), 0.9 % sodium chloride solution, ringers solution and 20 % mannitol as the concentration of 1 and 50 μg/ml for 24 hours.</p><p>The stability of the diluted solutions of Dexmedetomidine 100 μg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion has been repeated at the end of shelf life in different infusion solutions in syringes after storage of 24 hours at ambient room temperature and at 2 to 8ºC. All results complied with the specification confirming that the dilution does not have an impact on the quality and stability of the finished product. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the diluted finished product is stable for 24</p><p>hours. In accordance with this study Dexmedetomidine 100 μg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion is compatible with sodium chloride, glucose, Ringer-acetate and mannitol infusion solutions as a concentration 4 μg/ml for 24 hours at ambient room temperature and at 2 to 8ºC.</p><p>Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are acceptable.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Non-clinical aspects</head><p>All main safety pharmacology and pivotal toxicology studies were performed according to Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), as stated by the applicant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Introduction</head><p>Dexmedetomidine has been evaluated in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies to characterise its mechanism of action and sedative, anaesthetic-sparing, analgesic, anxiolytic effects. Effects on noradrenaline release and intracellular signalling were also studied.</p><p>In vivo secondary pharmacodynamic studies were also performed to investigate the effects on cardiovascular function (e.g on blood pressure/flow, heart rate, vascular resistance/contractility), cerebral vascular system and nerve cells.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is the dextro-enantiomer of medetomidine, a compound marketed as sedative/analgesic for veterinary use in several countries in the European Union.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Pharmacology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary pharmacodynamic studies</head><p>Dexmedetomidine has shown to be a potent and selective α2-adrenoceptor agonist. It is not selective for any specific α2-adrenoceptor subtype and has very low affinity for α1 adrenoceptors with a α2/α1 ratio of 1300/1. Similar pharmacological profiles for dexmedetomidine and the racemate, medetomidine were observed; however, the levo-rotatory enantiomer was shown to be pharmacologically inactive.</p><p>The principal human metabolites, H3 (imidazole oxidation product) and G-Dex (mixture of two N-glucuronide isomers) were &gt;183 and &gt;745-fold less potent at the α2-adrenoceptors, respectively and were not considered to have a significant contribution to the pharmacological effects of the compound.</p><p>In rats, dexmedetomidine caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of noradrenaline release (EC 50 :4 nM) in locus coeruleus cells. At dose &gt;30 g/kg, it caused a dose-dependent decrease in the levels of the principal noradrenaline metabolite and increased the levels of noradrenaline. Inhibition of noradrenaline turnover was observed at low doses (30 g/kg) with a maximal effects at 100 and 300 g/kg. Dexmedetomidine also reduced the turnover of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and dopamine at &gt;30 g/kg and &gt;100 g/kg, respectively. The sympathoinhibitory effect of dexmedetomidine was also observed in dogs at 0.25-20 g/kg resulting in a significant, dose-dependent decrease in the plasma levels of noradrenaline and/or adrenaline.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine has also shown to inhibit adenylate cyclase (possibly via activation of the G i protein) causing a decrease in the levels of cAMP. Studies also suggested inwardly-rectifying activation of potassium channels causing hyperpolarisation of the cell membrane and subsequent inhibition of neuronal cell firing rate. In addition, there is also evidence to suggest that dexmedetomidine causes a decrease in intracellular calcium via inhibition of N-type calcium channels, which in turn inhibits neurotransmitter release.</p><p>Similarly to all α2-adrenoceptor agonists, dexmedetomidine has sedative, analgesic and anxiolytic activity, the latter only being apparent at sub-sedative doses. Dexmedetomidine has been shown to produce dose dependent sedative and hypnotic effects in rats, dogs and in a variety of other species.</p><p>These effects are likely to be mediated by α2-adrenoceptors located in the locus coeruleus. After chronic subcutaneous administration (1-10 g/kg/h for 7 days), desensitization to the sedative and Dexdor Assessment report Page 13/79 2.3.2.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.3.2.3.</head><p>hypnotic/anaesthetic effects were observed in rats, although tolerance did not appear to develop for the sympatholytic or anaesthetic-sparing effects in clinical settting. Dexmedetomidine has also anxiolytic activity in the rat. The analgesic and antinociceptive effects, both after systemic and intrathecal administration, have been shown in a number of species. These effects are likely to be mediated by the activation of both pre-and postsynaptic α2-adrenoceptors that have a central as well as a spinal component.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary pharmacodynamic studies</head><p>The cardiovascular effects of dexmedetomidine have been extensively studied in a variety of species, in both the conscious and anaesthetised states. Intravenous (iv) administration of dexmedetomidine can be expected to produce transient hypertension and coronary vasoconstriction (peripheral postsynaptic effects), which will be dependent of the dose and rate of delivery, followed by hypotension and bradycardia (central and peripheral pre-synaptic sympatholytic effects and increased vagal tone).</p><p>Depressed cardiac function was also characterised by an increase in left ventricular end diastolic pressure that have been observed in dogs after iv dexmedetomidine (2.5 and 5 μg/kg). In general, no adverse effects were observed on cardiac function as cardiac oxygen demand was reduced as a result of the reduced heart rate, contractility and cardiac output. It should be noted however, that the depressive effects on contractility might be deleterious in heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction.</p><p>In some studies, anti-steal (reversal of abnormal myocardial blood flow) and anti-ischemic effects of dextemetomidine were also suggested.</p><p>Other secondary effects have been identified. In dogs, reduced cerebral blood flow was observed after concomitant administration of a number of anaesthetics. In rabbits and rats, some neuroprotective effects were observed and thought to be mediated via the  2A -receptors.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine was also shown to inhibit in vitro human platelet adenylate cyclase via  2A -receptors and effects on platelet (human) aggregation have been noted at 3 μM. Dexmedetomidine did not cause a full aggregatory response alone and is considered to act as partial agonist.</p><p>In rats, intraperitoneally administered dexmedetomidine (10-300 g/kg) increased growth hormone and prolactin release and these effects appear to be mediated via the  2 -receptor.</p><p>In dogs, no effect was observed on cortisol response after chronic administration dexmedetomidine (50 g/kg/day) as a 6-hour infusion. A slightly lower response was seen at higher dose (100 g/kg/day).</p><p>Dexmedetomidine (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) caused a significant reduction in insulin secretion, an increase in plasma glucose, but had no effect on the serum levels of free fatty acids.</p><p>In mouse and rat models of sepsis, dexmedetomidine (40 g/kg i.p. and 2.5-10 g/kg i.v., respectively) was suggested to improve survival and attenuate the plasma levels of inflammatory mediators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety pharmacology programme</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Central nervous system</head><p>In rats, dexmedetomidine has shown anticonvulsant activity against kainic acid-induced and amygdala kindled seizures at 3-5 g/kg s.c., bupivacaine and levobupivacaine-induced seizures at 3.6 g/kg/h i.v. and cocaine induced seizures at 20 g/kg/h followed by 1 g/kg/h i.v. Intraperitoneal administration of up to 300 g/kg, had no effect on pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions in mice;</p><p>however, high intravenous doses (100 and 500 g/kg) reduced the pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure threshold in rats.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dexdor</head><p>Assessment report Page 14/79</p><p>In rhesus monkeys, dexmedetomidine (0.25 and 1 g/kg/infusion) demonstrated high rates of self-administration that were comparable to pentazocine (125 and 250 g/kg/infusion). In rats, cessation of repeated-intravenous administration of dexmedetomidine (hourly injections of 8 and 16 g/kg for 3-7 days) was associated with reduced weight gain and behavioural withdrawal signs (including hyperreactivity and piloerection); however, the degree of physical dependence was substantially less than that observed with morphine. Dexmedetomidine caused a dose-dependent decrease in body temperature in both rats and dogs. In dogs, cessation of a 7-day dexmedetomidine infusion (10 g/kg/h s.c.) was also associated with tachycardia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cardiovascular system</head><p>Dexmedetomidine and its primary metabolites (H-3, G-Dex-1 and G-Dex-2) inhibited the hERG channel current at high concentrations in human embryonic kidney cells (IC 50 values &gt; 10-30 M) No significant binding/affinity to L-Ca 2+ , K ATP + , voltage gated K + or Na + and chloride channels were observed with dexmedetomidine and its H-3 metabolite (1 M).</p><p>No effects on cardiac conduction were observed in dogs and rabbits at 0.01 M and 0.03-3 M, respectively. At higher doses (0.1 and 1 M), a small dose-dependent increase in action potential was observed in dog Purkinje fibres. At higher supra-therapeutic concentration of 10 M, a decrease in action potential duration was noted that was associated with a decrease in the maximal rate of depolarisation. Early or delayed afterdepolarisations were not observed. In anaesthetised guinea pigs, cumulative intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine at 9, 27 and 90 g/kg/h at 20 min intervals did not induce any effects on the duration of ventricular repolarisation. In dogs, a number of studies were performed suggesting that observed QT prolongations were caused by hypothermia rather than torsadogenic effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Respiratory system</head><p>Respiratory depressive effects were observed in a number of studied species. In rats, dexmedetomidine decreased minute ventilation and respiratory frequency after i.p administration of 250 g/kg followed by 0.5 g/kg/h i.v. In dogs, respiratory rate was reduced at iv dose of &lt; 2.5 g/kg while a dose dependent increase in respiratory depression was observed at 10-100 g/kg. Moderate respiratory depression has also been noted in conscious rabbits and monkeys following intravenous and subcutaneous administration at &gt; 80 g/kg and &gt; 3 g/kg, respectively. In sheep and goats, dexmedetomidine significantly increased respiratory resistance and induced arterial hypoxia and pulmonary oedema, particularly after rapid bolus administration (2 g/kg). Significant increase in respiratory resistance was also observed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other systems</head><p>In mice, dexmedetomidine (1-100 g/kg/s.c) caused a transient (&lt;3 hours) dose-dependent reduction in intestinal motility. In rats, inhibition of gastrointestinal transit (ED 50 value: 40 g/kg) and gastric emptying (slightly) was observed after i.p administration.</p><p>In rats, dexmedetomidine (10 and 30 g/kg/s.c) caused diuresis, naturesis and kaliuresis. These effects are thought to be partly mediated via reduced arginine vasopressin-stimulated water and sodium transport.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine (3 g/kg s.c.), when administered as a bolus alone or bolus dose plus infusion also reduced renal impairment in rat models of renal ischaemia and reperfusion. These effects appear to be mediated via preservation of blood flow within the outer medulla.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.4.">Pharmacodynamic drug interactions</head><p>Dexmedetomidine acts synergistically when given in combination with midazolam, diazepam and fentanyl. In rats and dogs, it enhanced the anxiolytic, sedative and hypnotic effects of benzodiazepines and the antinociceptive effects of opioids. It reduced the anaesthetic requirements by up to 90%. In guinea pigs, it prolonged the spinal anaesthesia induced by levobupivacaine and enhanced the local anaesthetic action of lidocaine.</p><p>In dogs, dexmedetomidine (10-50 g/kg p.o or 10 g/kg i.v) counteracted the increased heart rate, rate of increase of left ventricular pressure at 50 mmHg (dP/dt 50) , rate-pressure product and/or cardiac output caused by ketamine and attenuated the decrease in mean arterial blood pressure caused by halothane and isofluorane. In addition, dexmedetomidine prevented the increased heart rate and blood pressure observed during emergence from enfluorane anaesthesia with enfluorane and the loss of baroceptor reflex that occurs with halothane anaesthesia.</p><p>In several species (rats, cats and dogs), anti-cholinergics such as atropine and glycopyrrolate inhibited the reduced heart rate observed with dexmedetomidine and also increased the myocardial oxygen consumption and the severity and duration of hypertension. Dexmedetomidine had no effect on the neuromuscular blocking actions of pancuronium, vecuronium or suxamethonium in rats.</p><p>Effects of calcium channel blockers on dexmedetomidine were noted. Isradipine attenuated dexmedetomidine-induced (0.1-10 g/kg i.v.) decrease in heart rate/cardiac output and increase in blood pressure without any effect on the decreased plasma levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline.</p><p>Nifedipine normalised all dexmedetomidine-induced (20 g/kg i.v.) haemodynamic changes observed during isoflurane anaesthesia, without decreasing its anaesthetic sparing activity. Nifedipine also enhanced the dexmedetomidine-induced (300 mg/kg) hypnosis, anaesthesia and diuresis.</p><p>In ethanol-fed rats, dexmedetomidine (10 mg/kg s.c.) has shown to relieve withdrawal reactions (rigidity, tremor, irritability) and prevent overactivity and degeneration of catecholaminergic neurons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Pharmacokinetics</head><p>The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of dexmedetomidine were predominantly investigated in rats and dogs following different routes of administration (subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal and epidural). Additional studied species were also referred to (e.g rabbits, cats and sheeps).</p><p>Dexmedetomidine was readily absorbed following subcutaneous or intramuscular administration in rats and dogs. Cmax was reached within less than an hour and the half-life of elimination was up to approximately 2 hours after single administration. In these species, the pharmacokinetics was nonlinear with C max and AUC increasing with the dose in a supra-proportional manner. No evidence of accumulation was observed upon repeated-dosing.</p><p>The radioactive drug was rapidly and widely distributed over the body. The apparent volume of distribution ranged from 0.8-2.16 L/kg in the studied species. Tissue concentrations were higher than plasma in the liver, adrenal glands, kidneys, lungs, intestine, stomach, pancreas and eyes. Some binding to melanin was evidenced in eyes. Radioactivity in plasma and most tissues had decreased substantially within 72 hours with the exception of adrenals. Low binding to red blood cells was observed. Dexmedetomidine-related radioactivity crossed the placenta barrier in pregnant rats, with highest fetal levels in blood, liver and kidneys. Foetal levels of dexmedetomidine were similar to maternal plasma levels. It was also excreted into the milk of lactating rats and the plasma/milk ratios were less than 1 at all time points. The plasma protein binding was 88% in rats, 95% in mice, 93% in dogs, 90% in cats and about 85% in monkeys.</p></div>

Carboxy metabolite, hydroxy metabolite, its corresponding glucuronide and sulphate conjugates as well as unidentified metabolites were detected in rats and dogs plasma. The main metabolite was the 3-hydroxyderivative. This metabolite is present in human and is not pharmacologically active. The patterns of plasma and urinary metabolites were very similar in rats and dogs and different from humans. Elimination seemed to be relatively rapid with half lives ranging from 0.6 in dogs to 2.6 hours in humans, the urine being the major route of excretion. In rats, total excretion of radiolabelled material was 93% of the dose in 72 hours and the majority was excreted during the first 24 hours (52-74% in urine and 14-27% in faeces).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.4.">Toxicology</head><p>The studies were conducted with dexmedetomidine hydrochloride and were performed predominantly in rats and dogs, using different routes of administration (intravenous: i.v, subcutaneous: s.c, intramuscular: i.m and intrathecal: i.t). In addition, studies were performed in the mice, guinea pigs and rabbits. The toxicity profiles of the 4 major (human) metabolites and the impurity, levomedetomidine, were also investigated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Single dose toxicity</head><p>Acute toxicity studies were performed in mice, rats and dogs using subcutaneous or intravenous routes. The lowest lethal dose (LLD) for acute toxicity of dexmetomidine in mice was 5 mg/kg for males and 10 mg/kg for females using the intravenous route and 20 mg/kg or greater (for females only) using the subcutaneous route. . The LLD for acute toxicity in rats was 5 mg/kg for both routes of administration for females and 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg for males for intravenous and subcutaneous routes, respectively. The main findings were dose dependent clinical signs consistent with the pharmacology of dexmedetomidine including sedation, piloerection, exophthalmos, tachypnoea, clonic convulsion, salivation, muscle twitching, decreased body temperature and tremors. The cause of death in rats (doses of &gt;5 mg/kg) and dogs (doses of 2 mg/kg) were related to congestive heart failure, hyperpyrexia or gastrointestinal atony.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeat dose toxicity</head><p>Repeated-dose toxicity studies of up to 4 weeks were performed in rats and dogs by i.v., s.c. and i.m. , i.t. routes of administration. Dose ranges tested in these studies were 20-500 μg/kg/day (rats, s.c. and i.m.), 10-1250 μg/kg/day (rat, i.v.) and 10-250 μg/kg/day (dogs, i.m. and i.v.), 2-80 μg/kg/day (dogs, i.t.). Dose-related sedation and piloerection were seen at all doses in both species. Rats also presented exophthalmos, while dogs showed signs of sporadic muscle twitches and irregular respiration rate.</p><p>Atrioventricular block were also observed in dogs and considered to be related to the pharmacological profile of dexmedetomidine. The corneal keratitis/opacity observed in both species were considered to be due to a reduction in the tear film and the blink reflex during sedation.</p><p>In lungs of rats, the presence of hemosiderin-laden macrophages was observed after chronic administration using different routes and were reversible over time. After iv bolus administration, changes in the levels of alkaline phosphatase and other hepatic enzymes, were noted in both species and liver weight and hepatocytes changes (i.e eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions) were also observed in rats and dogs, respectively. These laboratory and histological changes were not observed using iv 6 hour infusion.</p><p>In addition, a juvenile animal study was performed in dogs using a 6 hour infusion/day. noted at all dose levels and the depth of sedation increased with dose. Induction and reversal of sedation occurred rapidly following the onset and termination of dexmedetomidine infusion, respectively. Decreased body temperature was noted during infusion at all doses, Decreased heart rate was observed during infusion for all dose groups, which was accompanied by a prolonged QT interval;</p><p>both effects resolved within 1-2 hours after the completion of daily dosing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genotoxicity</head><p>The mutagenicity and clastogenicity of dexmedetomidine was evaluated using the standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests: Ames test, DNA repair test, gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells, mouse micronucleus test. All of these studies had negative results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Carcinogenicity</head><p>No carcinogenicity studies were performed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reproduction Toxicity</head><p>The effect of dexmedetomidine on fertility and early embryonic development was assessed in male and female rats and in female rabbits using s.c or i.v administration. Dexmedetomidine had no effect on male or female fertility at all tested doses up to 54 μg/kg/s.c. Maternal and foetal toxicity (including embryo-foetal deaths) were observed in most studies with the exception of the teratogenicity study performed in rabbits. In rats, 200 μg/kg/day/s.c caused an increase in embryofetal death and reduced the fetal body weight. This was associated with clear maternal toxicity. Reduced fetal body weight also was noted in rats at dose 18 μg/kg/day/s.c and was accompanied with delayed ossification at dose 54 μg/kg/day/s.c.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Toxicokinetic data</head><p>Toxicokinetic data on dexmedetomidine and metabolites were collected from pharmacokinetic or toxicology studies previously described. In rats and dogs, kinetics were non-linear, with C max and AUC increasing with dose in a supra proportional manner. No evidence of accumulation was observed upon repeated-dosing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Local Tolerance</head><p>Dexmedetomidine has shown some haemolytic potential and local arterial/intramuscular irritancy.</p><p>Perivascular fibrosis was also noted at the injections sites in previous described toxicology studies performed in rats and dogs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other toxicity studies</head><p>Dexmedetomidine did not absord light at ≥ 290 nm. No specific photoxicity study has been performed.</p><p>It did not cause any sign of anaphylaxis and/or hypersensitivity in guinea pigs. Other findings related to dependence have been previously described in the safety pharmacology studies.</p><p>The toxicity profiles of a number of metabolites were studied and did not show any relevant findings.</p><p>Although levometedomidine was found pharmacologically inactive, similar toxicity profile has been observed as compared to dexmedetomidine.</p><p>Dexdor Assessment report Page 18/79</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.5.">Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment</head><p>The results are summarised in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 1</ref>. Dexmedetomidine PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 g/L. and is not a PBT substance as log Kow does not exceed 4.5.Therefore dexmedetomidine is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.6.">Discussion on non-clinical aspects</head><p>The pharmacological studies adequately characterised the properties and principal effects of dexmedetomidine as well as potential harmful effects on vital organ systems. Receptor binding and functional studies in several in vitro and in vivo models demonstrated that dexmedetomidine acts as a potent and selective α2 adrenoceptor agonist. Sedative, analgesic and hypnotic effects were demonstrated in animals. Sedation and hypnotic effects were dose-dependent and enhanced by benzodiazepines and opioids. Anxiolytic effect appeared at sub sedative doses. Tolerance to the sedative and hypnotic effects was evidenced. The cardiovascular effects depend on the dose; with lower infusion rates the central effects dominate leading to decrease in heart rate and blood pressure.</p><p>With higher doses, peripheral vasoconstriction prevailed leading to an increase in systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure, while bradycardia is further emphasised.</p><p>The safety pharmacology identified mainly drug dependence and cardiac effects as possible targets for dexmedetomidine regarding potential adverse effects in man. Warnings related to abuse potential and withdrawal reactions and effect on seizures have been added in the SmPC to address the issue on drug dependence. Cardiovascular risk is also further discussed under the clinical safety 2.6. Respiratory depressive effects were observed in a number of studied species. The significant findings related to glucose metabolism were considered clinically manageable and not observed in clinical setting.</p><p>The results of pharmacokinetic studies in animals showed: rapid absorption; extensive tissue distribution (crossed the blood brain and placenta barriers), high protein binding and rapid elimination.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine drug related material is excreted both in urine and faeces and notably in milk.</p><p>However, while the patterns of plasma and urinary metabolites were very similar in rats and dogs, it substantially differs from the human pattern. On this basis, extrapolation from animal data to man was considered limited.</p><p>However, further investigation on the potential for drug interactions with drug products that either inhibit or induce the levels of CYP2A6, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 and on whether dexmedetomidine is a substrate or an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein transport pathway was required.</p><p>This is discussed under the clinical pharmacokinetics 2.4.2.</p><p>The majority of the findings in the repeated dose toxicity studies were related to the pharmacological activity of dexmedetomidine. Liver and cornea were identified as additional target organs in animals. In Dexdor Assessment report Page 19/79 these studies, the plasma concentrations observed at the No-Observe Adverse Effect Levels (NOAELs) in rats and dogs were higher (1.9 to 7.8 fold) than the proposed clinical plasma concentration of 2.5 ng/ml. Considering the intended clinical use, these safety margins were considered at an acceptable level.</p><p>In addition, a juvenile animal toxicity study was performed in dogs using a 6 hour infusion/day and show similar findings than those observed in adults.</p><p>There was no evidence of genotoxicity in a standard package of tests.</p><p>No carcinogenicity studies were performed and this can be considered acceptable in view of the proposed and anticipated maximum duration of treatment (14 days).</p><p>Dexmedetomidine had no effect on male or female fertility and no teratogenic effects were observed in animals. However, maternal and foetal toxicity (including embryo-foetal deaths) were noted. As a result, dexmedetomidine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. The potential effect of dexmedetomidine on foetal heart rate was discussed. There is currently no evidence to suggest such effect with dexmedetomidine.</p><p>Appropriate recommendations concerning pregnancy, lactation and breastfeeding are included in the</p><p>SmPC.</p><p>An ERA according to CHMP guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, June 2006) was submitted. The physiochemical properties of dexmedetomidine are: Molecular mass: 236.7 and freely soluble in water. Based its intended ICU use and maximum treatment duration of 14 days, the predicted environmental concentration in surface water was 0.00012738 μg/L (&lt; 0.01 μg/L). No Phase II studies were performed. However, basis for the refined of Fpen and Log D determination were questioned by the CHMP prior to any conclusion on the persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) properties of dexmedetomidine and its risk for the environment. Following clarifications provided by the applicant, the CHMP considered that a risk for the environment due to the intended use of dexmedetomidine in ICU patients is not expected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.7.">Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects</head><p>Overall, the non-clinical aspects of dexmedetomidine have been adequately documented and meet the requirements to support this application.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.1.">Introduction</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GCP</head><p>The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.</p><p>The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.2.">Pharmacokinetics</head><p>Pharmacokinetic <ref type="formula">(</ref> isoflurane:n=9, esmolol:n=11/12). The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile of dexmedetomidine was also investigated in some specific studies.</p><p>Concentrations of dexmedetomidine and its analysed metabolites were measured in plasma and urine using both GC/MS and HPLC-MS/MS methods in the PK studies. Dexmedetomidine and metabolites were also measured in faeces by radiolabel detection. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using non compartmental models. In addition, population PK analyses using nonlinear mixed effects modeling methodology (NONMEM) were also performed including data from patients at the highest infusion rate (1.4 μg/kg/h) and also following infusion rate duration exceeding 24 hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Absorption</head><p>No bioavailability, bioequivalence and food interaction studies were performed. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP considering the proposed formulation is a clear, colourless solution containing dexmedetomidine, sodium chloride and water for injection and is intended for intravenous infusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distribution</head><p>Dexmedetomidine exhibits a rapid distribution phase with a central estimate of the distribution half-life of about 6 minutes. The mean estimate of the Vss is approximately 1.16 to to 2.16 l/kg (90 to 151 litres). Dexmedetomidine is highly bound (94%) to human plasma proteins including α1-acid glycoprotein and albumin, the latter being the major binding protein. No apparent concentration dependency or sex related differences were observed in the range of 0.85-85 ng/ml. Up to 1 % decrease in the protein binding for dexmedetomidine was noted with lidocaine, for the other substances (fentanyl, ketorolac, theophylline and digoxin), the decrease in protein binding was between 0.13-0.30 %. Displacement of other medicinal products (phenytoin, warfarin, ibuprofen, propranolol, theophylline and digoxin) by dexmedetomidine was not observed. In a concentration range of 1-100 ng/ml, the total plasma protein bound fraction was 83 % the metabolite H-3. The free fraction of H-3 in plasma is observed to be three times higher than for dexmedetomidine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Elimination</head><p>Dexmedetomidine is primarily eliminated by metabolism. Direct glucuronidation (main pathway), Nmethylation and oxidation occurred. In a mass balance study, the majority of the radioactive dose was mainly recovered in urine (about 94%) with a dose identified for approximately 66%. Approximately 6 % of the radioactivity was not identified in plasma. Unchanged parent drug was not observed in urine and only trace amounts were noted in faeces. The radioactivity declined over a period of 9 days, traces were still present up to 24 days. The majority of the total radioactivity in plasma constituted of After intravenous infusion, the mean estimate of the elimination t1/2 is approximately 1.9 to 2.5 hours (min 1.35 h and max 3.68 h) and total plasma clearance, the PK parameter interrelating i.v. infusion rate with steady-state plasma concentration, has mean estimated values of 0.46 to 0.73 l/h/kg (35.7 to 51.1 l/h). In healthy volunteers, the clearance values observed suggested that dexmedetomidine was a medium to high extraction ratio substance.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">dexmedetomidine (14.7 %), G-Dex-1 (35 %), G-Dex-2 (6%),</formula><p>Dexdor Assessment report Page 21/79 2.4.2.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.4.2.5.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dose proportionality and time dependencies</head><p>Although clearance appeared to be higher at 2.5 μg/kg/h, dose proportionality has been shown for dexmetomidine up to this dose covering thus the therapeutic dose range of interest, i;e 0.2-1.4 μg/kg/h. No convincing time dependency has been observed in dexmetomidine PK while high interindividual variability has been noted: 57% to 63% for clearance and 60-68% for volume of distribution. This is suggested to be mainly due to the differences in the severity of the disease in ICU patients and is considered manageable given dexmetomidine is dosed to its effects and administered under close surveillance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special populations</head><p>Specific phases I studies evaluating renal and hepatic functions, paediatric population, effects of race and age were conducted. Other data related to age, gender and weight were derived from population PK analyses.</p><p>A specific study was conducted in subjects with stable severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min) after a single 10-minute i.v. infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.6 μg/kg. The pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine in these subjects was not altered relative to healthy subjects (creatinine clearance &gt;80 ml/min).</p><p>A specific study was conducted in subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment based on Child-Pugh classification (sum Child Pugh scores of 5-6, 7-9 and 10-15) after a single 10-minute i.v.</p><p>infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.6 μg/kg. Dexmedetomidine plasma protein binding is decreased in subjects with hepatic impairment compared with healthy subjects. The mean percentage of unbound dexmedetomidine in plasma ranged from 8.5% in healthy subjects to 17.9% in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. Subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment had decreased hepatic clearance of dexmedetomidine and prolonged plasma elimination t 1/2 . The mean plasma clearance values of unbound dexmedetomidine for subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment were 59%, 51% and 32% of those observed in the normal healthy subjects, respectively. The mean t 1/2 for the subjects with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment was prolonged to 3.9, 5.4, and 7.4 hours, respectively.</p><p>Single and multiple dose studies were conducted in children and adolescent including 24 pediatric subjects (age 2.3-11.5 years of age) and 36 paediatric subjects (12 patients in the age range of 2 to &lt;6 months, 17 patients in the age range 6 to &lt;12 months and 7 patients in the range of 12 to 20 months), respectively. Dexmedetomidine half life appears similar to that seen in adults. In the age groups 2-20 months and 2-6 years, body weight-adjusted plasma clearance appeared higher (1.2 and 1.0 l/h/kg, respectively) but decreased in older children (0.8 l/h/kg) to be comparable to adults (0.5-0.6 l/h/kg).</p><p>A specific study was conducted to evaluate the effect of age after a single 10-minute i.v. infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.6 μg/kg and included 20 subjects &gt;65 years. Nine subjects out of 20 were 74 years or older (up to 83 years). The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores for sedation indicated a higher sensitivity in young subjects, and also females had a tendency to report higher level of sedation than males during the infusion and immediately after. Age did not appear to influence on the pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine.</p><p>Population pharmacokinetic analyses did not reveal any significant effect of age. In these analyses, there was a tendency to increased sedation in female subjects. Although variability was large, a relationship between weight and both clearance and volume of distribution of dexmetomidine was also noted. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.4.3.2.</head><p>Specific studies were conducted in Caucasian, South Korean and Japanese subjects to evaluate the effect of race. There were no significant differences observed between these populations after multiple dosing. The population PK analyses provided no further information with respect to race, since the major proportion of subjects in these analyses were Caucasians.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacokinetic interaction studies</head><p>In vitro studies suggested that the oxidative metabolism of dexmetomidine is mediated by several enzymes (CYP2A6, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19) with no apparent predominant pathways.</p><p>Dexmetomidine has shown strongest properties for inhibition of CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Thus, interaction potential in vivo may exist between dexmedetomidine and substrates with dominant CYP2B6 metabolism. Inducing properties were also shown for dexmetomidine on CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Induction in vivo cannot be excluded although the clinical significance is unknown. Studied metabolites (H-1 analogue and H-3) appeared to inhibit CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 to a level suggesting a limited interaction potential in vivo. In addition, In vitro studies indicated that dexmetomidine was not regulated via the p-glycoprotein pathway.</p><p>The potential interactions were studied in humans for the following drugs: isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil, midazolam. Although no pharmacokinetic interactions were observed with these drugs, coadministration led to an enhancement of the pharmacodynamic effects.</p><p>Furthermore, a slight increase in the concentrations of rocuronium after administration of dexmedetomidine was initiated, likely due to steady state concentration of rocuronium that was not reached (t ½ between 66-80 minutes). The infusion rate was higher than the anticipated elimination rate, and a higher than targeted dexmedetomidine concentration was therefore observed.</p><p>Co-administration with esmolol suggested modest enhancement of hypotensive and bradycardic effects.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanism of action</head><p>Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-2 receptor agonist with a broad range of pharmacological</p><p>properties. It has a sympatholytic effect through decrease of the release of noradrenaline in sympathetic nerve endings. Unlike other sedative agents used in standard of care and acting as GABA receptor antagonists (e.g midazolam, propofol), its effects are claimed to be mediated through decreased firing of locus coeruleus, the predominant noradrenergic nucleus, situated in the brainstem conferring a mechanism of arousal and different form of sedation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary and Secondary pharmacology</head><p>Pharmacodynamic effects of dexmedetomidine were studied on haemodynamic variables, respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract and endocrine systems. Sedative and analgesic effects were also investigated. Mechanistical studies covering the effects of dexmedetomidine on the function of the sympathetic nervous system were done to characterise pharmacological mechanisms underlying the observed pharmacodynamic effects of dexmedetomidine. Some of these studies were previously discussed in relation to the pharmacokinetic profile of dexmedetomidine.</p><p>Dexdor Assessment report Page 23/79</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sedative Effects</head><p>Following a two-stage dexmedetomidine infusion continued for up to 24 h, after an initial loading dose, dexmedetomidine-treated subjects consistently exhibited greater average sedation than placebotreated subjects. In one study, VAS sedation scores revealed no statistically significant difference between 0.6 ng/mL and 1.25 ng/mL dexmedetomidine groups. The percentage of time at Ramsay sedation scale (RSS) scores of 3, 4, or 5 revealed a dose-response among dexmedetomidine-treated subjects, with 0.6 ng/mL and 1.25 ng/mL groups exhibiting a longer duration of sedation than the 0.3 ng/mL group during the 12-and 24-hour infusions. Results on Critical Flicker Fusion Treshold (CFFT)</p><p>suggested an arousal effect easily achieved with dexmetomidine as no differences were observed as compared to placebo. Overall, the rate of development of sedation (measured by the median time to a RSS score of 4 or higher within the first hour) was rapid during dexmedetomidine administration when the infusion was initiated with a rapid loading dose, ranging from a median of 15 minutes (0.6 ng/ml group) to 33 minutes (0.3 ng/ml group) after the start of the infusion. Sedation in the 1.25 ng/ml group developed at a slower rate than in 0.6 ng/ml group possibly due to the loading dose infused at a slower rate. The rate of onset of sedation in the absence of a loading dose has not been studied. The mean RSS score of 3 or higher was constantly rated starting from a dexmedetomidine plasma concentration range of 0.2 to 0.3 ng/ml. It also appears that a plateau in the level of sedation was achieved between 0.7 ng/ml and 1.25ng/ml target concentration for dexmedetomidine groups, corresponding to maintenance infusion rates between 0.337-0.7µg/kg/hr, and sedation did not increase further at higher dexmedetomidine concentration ranges. In another study including Japanese subjects, mean VAS sedation scores were statistically significantly greater than placebo at all targeted concentrations (ranging from 0.3-1.25 ng/ml) except 0.1 ng/ml. Only the 1.25 ng/ml concentration differed significantly from placebo, suggesting that treated subjects were easily arousable and able to complete the test. The four highest dose groups spent most of the treatment period with RSS score of 3, 4 or 5. No statistically significant differences were seen between active or placebo groups with regard to RSS scores of 6 (i.e. asleep) suggesting that patients although sedated, were not rendered unconscious with the active treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Haemodynamic, cardiovascular effects</head><p>Several cases of bradycardia and sinus pauses have been reported after dexmedetomidine administration in healthy volunteers. The reported sinus pauses have lasted up to 30 seconds. Some of the reported sinus pauses have been associated with unconsciousness, convulsions, collapse and bradycardia, but all reported sinus pauses have resolved without sequelae.</p><p>A biphasic change on blood pressure has been observed with dexmedetomidine, with decreases at the low concentrations, followed by a return to baseline, and increases over the mean baseline level when the plasma concentration of dexmedetomidine was &gt; 3.2 ng/ml. Heart Rate (HR) decreased until the actual mean plasma concentration of dexmedetomidine ranged from 3.2 to 5.1 ng/ml, after which HR reached a plateau.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine administration caused dose-related decreases in cardiac output (CO) of approximately 20% to 30% at dexmedetomidine plasma concentrations of 2 to 4 ng/ml, but at higher concentrations no further decrease in CO was observed. Decreases in CO have been associated with reduced hepatic elimination clearance of dexmedetomidine and decreased cerebral blood flow velocity.</p><p>The safety of dexmedetomidine has not studied in patients requiring maintenance of normal cerebral blood flow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Respiratory effects</head><p>Dexdor Assessment report Page 24/79</p><p>Dexmedetomidine has caused a modest reduction in respiratory rate (RR) and/or ventilation in several clinical pharmacology studies, and in some cases supplementary oxygen has been administered to maintain blood oxygen saturation levels. There are also several reports of apnoea and abnormal breathing pattern associated with dexmedetomidine administrations, but no ventilatory support has been needed. However, results on respiratory effects are not consistent throughout all clinical pharmacology studies, e.g. low saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2) values observed after dexmedetomidine in some studies have been attributed to upper airway obstruction during sedation rather than to direct effects on respiratory system. Dexmedetomidine has potentiated the respiration depressant effect of alfentanil, when the drugs were given concomitantly,. Dexmedetomidine did not cause significant respiratory depression when compared to remifentanil in healthy volunteers, despite clearly deeper sedation <ref type="bibr">(Hsu Y et al., 2004)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analgesic effects</head><p>In human pharmacology, a decrease of pain perception has been generally observed with an increase of dexmedetomidine concentration ranging from 0.7-8.4 ng/ml.</p><p>In an interaction study with alfentanil, dexmedetomidine was analgesic at the target plasma concentrations of 0.3 and 0.6 ng/ml, which effect was additive with the analgesic action of alfentanil.</p><p>In addition, dexmedetomidine has not shown to be as effective analgesic as some opioids (e.g fentanyl, remifentanil) reaching a maximal analgesic effect after an injected dose of 0.50 μg/kg.</p><p>However, some literature data suggest that no analgesic effect is observed with dexmedetomidine as compared with placebo <ref type="bibr">(Angst MS et al., 2004)</ref>, others indicate that dexmedetomidine reduced consumption of other analgesic drugs postoperatively <ref type="bibr">(Cicek M et al., 2006</ref><ref type="bibr">, Gunes Y et al., 2008</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect on Noradrenaline (NA)</head><p>In a study using dexmetomidine as a 0.375 µg/kg bolus over 1 minute, followed immediately by a 0.375 µg/kg/h infusion, the concentration of NA in plasma decreased to about 0.1-0.2 nmol/l in all 4 healthy subjects from a baseline concentration of 1.62±0.45 nmol/l. Maximal effects were noted about 2 hours after the beginning of the infusion. After termination of the infusion, NA levels gradually increased, although they were still below baseline 2 hours after termination of the infusion.</p><p>In another study using three different doses of dexmetomidine (0.10, 0.30 and 0.60 µg/kg), a dosedependent decrease in NA concentrations was observed. After the highest dexmedetomidine dose (0.6 ug/kg), average peak drug concentrations were 1.068 ng/mL, which were associated with a decline in the NA concentrations from a baseline value of 0.11 ng/mL to 0.04 ng/mL at 0.25 hours postdosing.</p><p>Effects at the 0.1 ug/kg dose level were minimal.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.4.">Discussion on clinical pharmacology</head><p>The pharmacokinetic profile (absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination) of dexmedetomidine has been studied following short term IV administration in healthy volunteers and long term infusion in ICU population.</p><p>The pharmacokinetic profile dexmedetomidine in stable severe renal impaired subjects was not altered relative to healthy subjects (creatinine clearance &gt;80 ml/min) and therefore no dose adjustment is required in case of renal impairment.</p><p>Changes in the pharmacokinetic profile of dexmedetomidine in patients with various degrees of hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B, or C) were observed as compared to healthy subjects.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine plasma protein binding is decreased in subjects with hepatic impairment.The mean percentage of unbound dexmedetomidine in plasma ranged from 8.5% in healthy subjects to 17.9% in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. Subjects had also decreased hepatic clearance of dexmedetomidine and prolonged plasma elimination t 1/2 . On this basis, section 4.2 of the SmPC recommends that dexmedetomidine should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment and that a dose reduction may be considered in this population. At the CHMP request, a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC was also added on severe hepatic impairment and possible excessive dosing that may lead to over sedation and increase risk of adverse reactions.</p><p>There are limited data in children and adolescents from 2 month to 17 years of age. Dexmedetomidine half life appears similar to that seen in adults. In the age groups 2-20 months and 2-6 years, body weight-adjusted plasma clearance appeared higher (1.2 and 1.0 l/h/kg, respectively) but decreased in older children (0.8 l/h/kg) to be comparable to adults (0.5-0.6 l/h/kg). At the CHMP request, this information has been reflected in the SmPC and a statement was also included to reflect that plasma clearance may be lower in children &lt; 2 months due to immaturity. However, the safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine in children and adolescents has not been established (see clinical safety 2.6.9). Effect of age was specifically investigated and 20 subjects &gt;65 years were studied. Nine subjects out of 20 were 74 years or older (up to 83 years). Age did not appear to influence on the pharmacokinetic profile of dexmedetomidine and therefore no dose adjustment is required in elderly population.</p><p>There were no significant PK differences between Caucasian South Korean and Japanese subjects.</p><p>Additional population PK analyses did not provide further information as the majority of the subjects were Caucasians.</p><p>Population pharmacokinetic analyses did not reveal any significant effect of age. In these analyses, there was a tendency to increased sedation in female subjects. Although variability was large, a relationship between weight and both clearance and volume of distribution of dexmetomidine was also noted.</p><p>Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. Co-administration of dexmedetomidine with anaesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics, and opioids is likely to lead to an enhancement of effects. Specific studies have confirmed these effects with isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil, and midazolam. No pharmacokinetic interactions between dexmedetomidine and isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil and midazolam have been observed. A modest enhancement of hypotensive and bradycardic effect was observed with esmolol. In vitro study suggests that interaction potential in vivo exists between dexmedetomidine and substrates with dominant CYP2B6 metabolism while induction in vivo cannot be excluded on CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. This information has been considered relevant and reflected in the SmPC.</p><p>No relevant changes in the pharmacokinetic profile of rocuronium were noted when co-administered with dexmedetomidine.</p><p>Specific pharmacodynamic studies and literature data confirmed the effects of dexmedetomidine as typical of an alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist in humans. The moderate sedative effects accompanied by analgesic properties are of benefits for its intended clinical use in the post surgical, intensive care setting. Dexmedetomidine can be considered relatively free from respiratory depressive effects in humans. Nevertheless, a plateau effect was observed between 0.7 ng/ml and 1.25ng/ml target concentration for dexmedetomidine, corresponding to maintenance infusion rates between 0.337-0.7µg/kg/hr, and sedation did not increase further at higher dexmedetomidine concentration ranges.</p><p>On this basis, further analyses on the relationship between the infusion rate and the target plasma concentration/effect were provided to support the proposed dose range of 0.2-1.4 µg/kg/hr and were considered satisfactory (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 2</ref>, Figures 2,3 and 4).</p><p>In line with pre clinical findings, effects on haemodynamic, cardiovascular systems were observed.</p><p>Following administration of dexmedetomidine, a dose dependent reduction in plasma noradrenaline level was also shown accompanied by significant reductions in cardiac output and mean arterial pressure. A number of warnings had been initially included in the SmPC regarding these effects.</p><p>However, considering the clinical intended use in ICU setting, the CHMP was concerned about the haemodynamic changes observed with dexmedetomidine and the high risk population (e.g with cardiovascular conditions or requiring stable cerebral blood flow). Contraindications in patients with advanced heart block (grade 2 or 3) unless paced, uncontrolled hypotension and acute cerebrovascular conditions were subsequently added and reinforcement of the warnings were made. These changes were considered sufficient to ensure safe use of the product in the intended ICU setting.</p><p>On the basis of available literature data, the CHMP questioned the observed lack of effect on cortisol suppression in humans and required further discussion on this finding. This is reported under the clinical safety 2.6.</p><p>Dexdor Assessment report Page 29/79 2.5.2.1.</p></div>

In part I, all subjects remained successfully sedated through intubation and post extubation. The mean hourly RSS score was 3.9 (by AUC) and the mean (±SD) dose of dexmedetomidine was 5.4 (±1.58) µg/kg over mean duration of 13.8 (±1.48) h.</p><p>One patient received midazolam 0.00057 mg/h as an infusion for additional sedation. In part II , the 6 dexmedetomidine patients required no additional midazolam (0.00 mg/kg/h) whereas 5 of the 6 placebo patients required midazolam (0.18 (±0.005) mg/kg/h); p = 0.010). The mean hourly RSS scores were similar (dexmedetomidine 3.5, placebo 3.4). The total dose of morphine used was higher in the placebo (0.008mg/kg/h) group than in the dexmedetomidine group (0.001 mg/kg/h); p = 0.040.

A total of 5 patients in the dexmedetomidine group and 3 patients in the placebo group were prematurely withdrawn. There was a significant difference in the primary efficacy variable; the results showed that 85.5% (47/55) of the patients in the dexmedetomidine treated group, compared with 37.5% (21/56) in the placebo treated group, did not require propofol rescue medication. There was a significant difference in the amount of rescue propofol used, in favour of dexmedetomidine; the dexmedetomidine group required 84.6 mg of propofol compared to the placebo group which required 330.5 mg of propofol during the intubation period (p = 0.0005) to maintain a RSS score ≥ 3. The RSS score was higher for dexmedetomidine than for placebo (dexmedetomidine 3.387, placebo 3.089, p = 0.032).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Randomisation</head><p>The random allocation of treatments to subject numbers was performed according to the design of the study by a two-step procedure. Firstly, the vials containing the study drugs were assigned a random package number using the randomly permuted blocks. A detailed description of the randomisation method, including the size of randomly permuted blocks used to balance the randomisation, is stored in the Department of Biostatistics and Data Management. Secondly, study subjects were randomised centrally, using an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS), either to continue their current sedative agent or switch to dexmedetomidine in an equal allocation ratio 1:1. The package number was then assigned to the unique subject number allocated by the investigator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Blinding (masking)</head><p>Dexdor Assessment report Page 37/79 A double-dummy procedure was used to mask the identities of the study drugs. In order to maintain the blind for all study personnel involved in the care and assessment of study subjects, all stages of the preparation of all study drugs, including connection and disposal of syringes and infusion lines, were carried out in confidence only by nominated independent persons who were not involved in making study-related assessments (except for study 3005013). None of the persons directly involved in the conduct of the study were to have access to the treatment codes, with the exception of the investigator in case of an emergency.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical methods</head><p>In all active controlled studies, the Per Protocol (PP) population was used as primary analysis and (ITT) population as secondary analysis for the first co-primary efficacy variable evaluating non inferiority. For the other efficacy variables, the ITT population was used as primary analysis and a sensitivity analysis was performed using PP population, according to study protocol. For the efficacy variables other than co-primary or secondary, the following statistical methods were used: Missing values in the efficacy variables were replaced using the imputation method depending on the type of analysis performed. In studies 3005012 and 3005013, the following applied for co-primary efficacy missing values: If subject does not start study drug infusion, time on target is considered nil;</p><p>If subject dies while on study drug, time of death is used as end of study drug infusion; If RASS target is not set at baseline, mild to moderate (RASS 0 to -3) is assumed. If RASS assessment is missing during the study drug infusion, value is not imputated but interpolated from preceding and consequent assessments. If gap between the two RASS assessments is more than 7 hours and more than 30% of anticipated assessments are missing, subject will be excluded from PP analysis set; if time of randomisation is missing, then the time of decision of entry will be used instead ; if end time of mechanical ventilation is missing then time being medically fit for discharge from study hospital ICU will be used.</p></div>

For subjects with delirium at baseline, 69.7% of dexmedetomidine subjects and 94.6% of midazolam subjects had delirium during the double blind treatment (DBT) period (p=0.0001). For subjects without delirium at baseline, 33.3% of dexmedetomidine subjects and 55.3% of midazolam subjects had delirium during the DBT (p=0.0397). There was a consistently greater than 20% treatment effect between dexmedetomidine and midazolam in the incidence of delirium.</p><p>Midazolam-treated subjects experienced more delirium days than dexmedetomidine-treated subjects overall (mean days: 3.3 and 1.9 days, respectively; p&lt;0.0001), during the DBT (mean days: 2.7 and 1.4 days, respectively; p&lt;0.0001), and in the follow-up period (mean days: 0.7 and 0.5 days, respectively; p=0.0401). Dexmedetomidine-treated subjects experienced more delirium-free days than midazolam-treated subjects overall (mean days: 4.3 and 3.2 days, respectively; p=0.0050), during the DBT (mean days: 2.8 and 1.9 days, respectively; p=0.0018), and in the follow-up period (1.8 and 1.5 days, respectively; p=0.1269). Dexmedetomidine-treated subjects reached a delirium-free day sooner (3.1 days) than midazolam-treated subjects (7.8 days) during the DBT and 48 hour follow-up (p&lt;0.0001).Therefore, at equivalent levels of sedation (RASS -2 to +1) dexmedetomidine causes less delirium than midazolam as well as reduces the incidence of pre-existing delirium in mechanically ventilated subjects in the ICU.</p><p>The incidence of fentanyl use and the doses of fentanyl used for any reason and for pain relief were not significantly different between the treatment groups during <ref type="bibr">DBT (p&gt;0.2778</ref> The overall total nursing assessment score was significantly higher for the dexmedetomidine group (mean score: 22.0) than for the midazolam group (mean score 19.9; p=0.0145), representing a more favourable overall score for dexmedetomidine compared with midazolam. Mean separate communication and cooperation scores were significantly different between the treatment groups (p = 0.0064 and p = 0.0191, respectively); however, the mean overall tolerance of ventilator score was not significantly different between the treatment groups (p = 0.2391). These data indicate that nurses caring for critically-ill patients on ventilators were more satisfied with dexmedetomidine sedation than midazolam.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.3.">Discussion on clinical efficacy Early Studies</head><p>In early studies comparing dexmedetomidine with placebo and using the RSS score to measure sedation level, the population studied was post-surgery patients and composed mostly of post-cardiac surgery patients. The study drug administration was limited to 24-30 hours. The treatment was preventive in intubated patients. Dexmedetomidine, in comparison to placebo, demonstrated a sparing effect of sedative drugs used i.e midazolam or propofol. The mean dose of midazolam during intubation was 4.8 mg for dexmedetomidine and 18.6 mg for placebo (p=0.0011). The mean dose of propofol during intubation was 72 mg for dexmedetomidine and 513 for placebo (p&lt;0.0001). The RSS score was statistically higher in the dexmedetomidine groups. The dexmedetomidine treated patients required on average less than half of the amount of morphine given to the placebo-controlled patients.</p><p>The mean total dose of morphine by ITT analysis was 0.9 and 0.4 mg/h for the placebo (n=373) and dexmedetomidine (n=381) groups respectively (p&lt;0.001). Results were consistent in all phase III placebo controlled studies.</p><p>In a phase II study (W98-274) using the BIS score to measure the sedation level, the population studied was differently composed with less post-surgery patients to cardiac surgery (53% The above results provided positive findings regarding the efficacy of dexmedetomidine as a sedative agent. However, the CHMP considered that in these trials, the population studied, the duration of the treatment and the study design (lack of active comparator, scales used to measure sedation) did not allow to draw a definite conclusion concerning the use of dexmedetomidine in the current ICU setting.</p><p>In a subsequent phase III study (3005011) using midazolam and propofol as active comparators (considered as standard of care) and RASS as scale to measure sedation level, dexmedetomidine was not proven to be clinically non-inferior to midazolam/propofol. The lower limit of the 95% CI for the estimated between-group ratio (0.79) was not within the pre-defined non-inferiority margin (&gt; 0.90).</p><p>Dexmedetomidine was less effective where a greater level of sedation (RASS -4) was required whereas Dexdor Assessment report Page 61/79 no difference between midazolam and propofol was found in this regard. Furthermore, no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups were observed in the length of stay in the ICU from randomisation. However, the CHMP noted that this study was early terminated and included only a total 85 patients and therefore was not conclusive on the efficacy of dexmedetomidine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pivotal Studies</head><p>With respect to the 2 additional phase III studies using both active comparators (midazolam for study 3005013 and propofol for study 3005012) and conducted line with the CHMP advice received in October 2000, efficacy results did not appear consistent:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3005012 (with propofol)</head><p>In study 3005012, treatment groups were balanced with respect to gender, age, weight and ethnic origin. In the ITT population (n=498), 326 (65.5%) were male. The mean age of the subjects was 61.7 years, ranging between 18 and 94 years. The majority of subjects (98.6%) were Caucasian, 0.6%</p><p>were Black, 0.4% were Asian and 0.4% were of other origin. The treatment groups were balanced with respect to clinical need of sedation, SAPS II and median time from ICU admission to randomisation:</p><p>The treatment groups were also balanced with respect to main reason for admission to ICU (medical, surgical or trauma) and type of ICU admission (emergency or planned): No statistically significant differences between the treatment groups were observed in the categorised primary diagnoses for admission to ICU.</p><p>The mean percentage of time at target sedation without use of rescue treatment were 64.6% versus 64.7% for dexmedetomidine and propofol groups, respectively, confirming non inferiority for the first co-primary endpoint. Both PP and ITT population showed consistent results, however; ITT results were less convincing than the PP (ratio: 0.97 versus 1.00), although the confidence interval (CI) was still above the non-inferiority margin of 0.85. For the second co-primary endpoint, the duration of mechanical ventilation did not differ statistically significantly between treatment groups using different tests (Gehan Wilcoxon : p=0.240; Cox HR:0.49, 0.77-1.13). From a statistical perspective, the hierarchical approach used for the co-primary endpoints can be considered sufficient to make the study positive.</p><p>However, the chosen non inferiority margin of 15%, higher than the previous early terminated pilot study (3005011) set up as 10% of difference was questioned by the CHMP. The CHMP also noted that patients were excluded if they were likely to require deep sedation i.e. a RASS &gt; -3, suggesting a possible enrichment of the population, given the findings of study 3005011. Furthermore, the CHMP was concerned that patients randomised to dexmedetomidine spent on average a substantially shorter time at target (33.51 versus 47.12 , ie 14 hours less) suggesting that patients on dexmedetomidine were discontinuing study treatment earlier than those on propofol for related treatment reasons. The number of discontinuations because of lack of efficacy further supported this finding. Therefore a post hoc analysis excluding the total duration of infusion to avoid masking the difference in % time at target , e.g using the total time for sedation instead was recommended. In this study, the use of rescue drugs was also significantly higher compared to propofol (e.g 72.5% versus 64.4% for first line rescue medication In study 3005013, the treatment groups were balanced with respect to gender, age, weight and ethnic origin. In the ITT population (n=500), 328 (65.6%) were male. The mean age of the subjects was 63 years, ranging between 19 and 97 years. The majority of subjects (96.2%) were Caucasian, 1.4%</p><p>were Hispanic, 1.0% were Black, 0.4% were Asian and 1.0% were of other origin.The treatment groups were balanced with respect to the clinical need of sedation, SAPS II and median time from ICU admission to randomisation. The treatment groups were balanced with respect to main reason for admission to ICU (medical, surgical or trauma) and type of ICU admission (emergency or planned).</p><p>The majority of subjects (70.6%) were admitted to ICU due to medical reasons and most subjects (95.2%) needed emergency care. No statistically significant differences between the treatment groups were observed in the categorised primary diagnoses for admission to ICU.</p><p>The mean percentage of time at the target sedation level without use of rescue treatment was 60.7% and 56.6% for dexmedetomidine and midazolam groups, respectively confirming non inferiority for the first co-primary endpoint. As the lower limit of the 95% CI for the estimated ratio between the treatment groups (0.97) was above the predefined non-inferiority margin (&gt; 0.85), dexmedetomidine was proven clinically non-inferior to midazolam. Both PP and ITT population showed consistent results with a better trend in the PP population (ratio: 1.09 versus 1.07) supporting the primary analysis.</p><p>Although duration of infusion was shorter as observed in the previous study 3005012, longer time at target was observed for dexmedetomidine group as compared with midazolam group (37.75 versus 37.07) supporting non inferiority results. However, the number of discontinuations because of lack of efficacy required further analyses prior any final conclusions are made.</p><p>The median duration of mechanical ventilation (i.e., time to being free from mechanical ventilation that was not re-instituted within 48 hours) was 41 hours shorter in the dexmedetomidine group (123 hours) than in the midazolam group (164 hours) in the ITT population. The pre-specified primary analysis was Cox's proportional hazards did not show statistical significance (Cox HR: 0.896, 0.738-1.087) while the Gehan-Wilcoxon test (which gives more weight to early events) did achieve statistical significance (p=0.033), suggesting a positive trend for the second co-primary endpoint.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supportive studies</head><p>Results from open label and phase IV studies were supportive of the efficacy of dexmedetomidine in the clinical intended use. However, it should be noted that the level of sedation used as endpoint for the Phase IV study was only at 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall discussion</head><p>Overall, the CHMP requested further analyses to support the robustness of the results for the non inferiority (given potential lack of efficacy) and efficacy on mechanical ventilation versus standard of care. The clinical relevance of a few hours shorter ventilation compared to midazolam should also be further discussed prior any final conclusions are made. For both studies, additional data on patient disposition regarding the presence or absence of an analgesic epidural (in the post-surgical patients)</p><p>and that of a tracheostomy were also requested. The CHMP noted that none of the pivotal studies investigated the use of dexmedetomidine as an 'induction agent' for the initiation of sedation. All of the patients studied were already sedated and ventilated at the time of randomisation. Furthermore, as a sedative rather than an anaesthetic agent, dexmedetomidine is unlikely to be suitable for intubation Dexdor Assessment report Page 63/79 and this scenario was not studied either. The CHMP therefore recommended the applicant to re consider the indication initially applied for, based on the robustness of the efficacy data. Furthermore, the CHMP noted that the use of a loading dose was not studied in phase III studies and recommended to remove it from the proposed dosing recommendation.</p><p>In responses to CHMP request, the applicant provided post-hoc analyses on co-primary endpoints, accounting for subjects prematurely withdrawn for the non inferiority analysis, and using time to extubation for the second co-primary analysis (see ancillary analyses 2.5.2.3).</p><p>On the basis of these analyses, the applicant made the following conclusions:</p><p>-The lower confidence intervals of the dexmedetomidine: ratios for standard treatment (propofol and midazolam) are &gt; 0.85 in each analysis, thus establishing non-inferiority. The ratios of dexmedetomidine / propofol or midazolam range from 0.96 to 1.12 indicating close similarity.</p><p>-Considering tracheostomy patients to be extubated at insertion of the tracheostomy rather than at removal of inspiratory assist made very small differences in either direction in these analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>-</head><p>The pooled data showed dexmedetomidine to be significantly better than standard sedation in Although, in the design of the phase III studies, there is an inherent methodological bias unfavouring dexmedetomidine in that patients who are already established on a sedative at an efficacious dose are likely to enter a period of "instability" when being switched to an alternative sedative, the CHMP noted that the majority of the patients who were successfully managed on dexmedetomidine did not require more rescue sedation than subjects receiving propofol, achieving a stable sedation.</p><p>The CHMP noted that the applicant proposed to revise the indication as follows:</p><p>"Dexdor is indicated for the light to moderate sedation of adult ICU patients. Light to moderate sedation means a sedation level not deeper than arousal in response to verbal stimulation (RASS 0 to -</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3)."</head><p>In addition, the applicant proposed to clearly inform the prescribers via the SmPC about the risk of insufficient sedation that was increased in patients who were difficult to sedate with standard care immediately prior to switching. In line with the CHMP recommendation, the applicant also amended the SmPC information to reflect that the use of a loading dose is not recommended as it can be associated with increased adverse reactions.</p><p>Dexdor Assessment report Page 64/79</p><p>Having considered above, the CHMP was of the opinion that the applicant provided sufficient evidence to conclude on the efficacy of dexmedetomidine as a sedative agent and that appropriate information has been included in the SmPC to ensure effective use of dexmedetomidine in the intended clinical use.</p><p>On this basis, the CHMP recommended the following indication:</p><p>"For sedation of adult ICU (Intensive Care Unit) patients requiring a sedation level not deeper than arousal in response to verbal stimulation (corresponding to Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) 0 to -3)."</p><p>The applicant agreed with the above recommended CHMP indication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.4.">Conclusions on the clinical efficacy</head><p>The CHMP concluded that the efficacy in maintaining sedation level not deeper than arousal in response to verbal stimulation (corresponding to Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) 0 to -3)" was demonstrated in adult ICU patients in the proposed dosing regimen for Dexdor (dexmedetomidine).</p></div>

The number of black subjects was low and so results may be significantly affected by case-mix but these subjects seemed to have a higher incidence of bradycardia and hyperglycaemia on dexmedetomidine.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Extrinsic Factors</head><p>The ICU studies were primarily conducted in Northern Europe or the USA. In those territories ICU practices are relatively consistent and that is expected to be the case also in general in Southern</p><p>Europe. There may be less frequent use of sedation stops in Southern European states and this could be expected to lead to more over-sedation and less agitation with standard of care but it is not known whether such differences would also exist during dexmedetomidine treatment. The pattern of adverse effects during clinical studies of dexmedetomidine in Japan does not appear substantially different from the European experience.</p><p>The standardised environment in the ICU somewhat reduces the possible impact of social factors such as culture and education. The major ICU studies did not collect data on these issues or on factors such as diet, alcohol use, smoking or drug abuse and therefore these cannot be tested adequately on the available database. However such substances are not continued in an ICU environment (except occasionally administration of nicotine to prevent withdrawal) and subjects in the submitted studies were not generally included until a point when high drug or alcohol levels at hospital admission could be expected to have diminished considerably.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.9.">Discussion on clinical safety</head><p>Patients treated in an ICU have typically substantial instability in several organ systems. Signs and symptoms that could be classified as AEs are very common among ICU patients and to identify AEs related to a certain drug requires large study populations if not obviously linked to a certain drug. The exposure to dexmedetomidine both in clinical studies and when used in daily clinical settings can be considered large. In clinical studies, 4765 subjects, whereof 2103 &lt; were ICU patients, have been exposed to dexmedetomidine. The estimated post-marketing exposure included more than 1 million patients. The safety database for dexmedetomidine is however limited regarding patients who required a duration of infusion longer than 24 hours and also those who experienced upper dose range &gt;0.7 µg/kg/h and representing approximately half of the total exposure. No studies on the use of dexmedetomidine in pregnancy or lactation have been performed and there are no exposures to pregnant or lactating women in the available studies. Considering the reproductivity seen in animal studies, dexmedetomidine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.</p><p>The overall safety profile of dexmedetomidine has been found to be rather consistent and most reported AEs can be associated to its agonist effects on alpha-2 adrenoceptors, mainly cardiovascular related AEs.</p><p>Cardiovascular events were most prominent with hypotension, hypertension and bradycardia being the most commonly reported AEs on dexmedetomidine. These AEs were reported with statistically significantly greater incidence in dexmedetomidine group as compared to propofol and midazolam groups. However no clear dose relationship has been established.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine had an overall neutral effect on mortality. Most deaths occurred well after the treatment period, were considered not related and reflected the common causes of death in critically ill patients in the ICU being refractory respiratory failure, multiple organ failure and septic shock or uncontrolled infection. In particular, cardiovascular deaths were not increased on dexmedetomidine.</p><p>Mortality in postsurgical patients and those in studies outside the ICU was very low with no apparent difference between treatment groups.</p><p>In the comparator controlled studies, SAEs were seen to have comparable incidence across treatment groups. The most common treatment emergent SAEs reported were respiratory failure, septic shock, sepsis, bradycardia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and hypotension. These are all common conditions that would be expected of a general ICU patient population with predominance of medical patients. The most common reasons for discontinuing study drug or reducing the dose were bradycardia, agitation and hypotension. Insufficient effect of dexmedetomidine was among the more common reasons for discontinuation and was previously discussed under clinical efficacy aspects.</p><p>Due to its pharmacological activity, dexmedetomidine also reduced HR resulting in more AEs of bradycardia as well as prolonged PR and QT interval on the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Four % of dexmedetomidine patients had bradycardia sufficiently severe to require treatment (normally anticholinergics) in studies 3005012 and 3005013. Additional cases of hypotension on dexmedetomidine reflected central sympatholysis. The pharmacological effect on glucose (reduction of insulin secretion leading to hyperglycaemia) was most likely masked by close glycaemic control in ICU patients and therefore both hypo/hyperglycaemia were commonly reported.</p><p>Dexdor Assessment report Page 72/79</p><p>Hallucinations were reported in more patients receiving dexmedetomidine than propofol and midazolam, particularly in the ICU, although this was still uncommon. Hallucinations were not observed in the non-ICU studies. Hallucinations are known to be common in critically ill patients regardless of the method of sedation.</p><p>Overall, the safety profile of dexmedetomidine is considered well known and manageable in the intended clinical use. Dexmedetomidine is for hospital use only and should be administered by healthcare professionals skilled in the management of patients requiring intensive care. The CHMP however was concerned about literature data suggesting off label use of dexmedetomidine, particularly in the paediatric population and recommended the conduct of a drug utilisation study to address this issue. In addition to previous SmPC recommendations related to cardiovascular safety of dexmedetomidine, the CHMP also requested to include a warning related to risk of hypothermic bradycardia in neonates and information on higher incidence of cortisol suppression in dexmedetomidine as compared to midazolam and propofol observed in clinical studies.</p></div>

Some secondary metabolites formed from another oxidative metabolite 3-OH were also observed in urine (G-OH and COOH), with 8 and 5 % respectively. Dexmedetomidine was not detected in urine and only trace amounts in faeces were observed. A large part of the dose in urine, 28 %, was not identified.

The clinical development program to support the claimed indication consisted of early studies comparing dexmedetomidine with placebo (W97-249, W98-274, J-DEX-99-001, W97-245 and W97-246) and more recent studies comparing dexmedetomidine to either midazolam or propofol (3005011, 3005012) following the CHMP advice in October 2000. Midazolam and propofol account for 95% of sedative treatments in the ICU. In addition, 3 open label studies (1999-016, W99-314 and W99-302) and a phase IV study (2001-001) were presented in the dossier (1999-016, W99-314 and W99-302) and their results are briefly summarised below.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_3"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>-274, 30 subjects entered the randomised trial: 15 on dexmedetomidine and 15 on placebo. Patients were post-operative to cardiac surgery (53%), cancer (&gt; 20% in each group) head and aneurysm requiring prosthesis (13%). Two patients in the placebo group were prematurely withdrawn : one could not be managed with BIS and one took a disallowed medication. There was a significant difference in the primary efficacy variable, amount of rescue propofol used, in favour of dexmedetomidine. During intubation the dexmedetomidine group required 0.87 mg/kg/h of propofol compared to the placebo group which required 1.52 mg/kg/h of propofol (p = 0.0058). During weaning the dexmedetomidine group required 0.17 mg/kg/h of propofol compared to the placebo group which required 0.62 mg/kg/h of propofol (p = 0.0003). Mean BIS scores were comparable during intubation (dexmedetomidine: 63, placebo: 66.6), weaning (dexmedetomidine: 67.8, placebo: 71.7) and extubation (dexmedetomidine: 89.0, placebo: 88.0), where the lower number indicates deeper sedation.During intubation the total dose of morphine required was not significantly lower for dexmedetomidine patients than for placebo patients during drug administration (dexmedetomidine 0.48 mg/h of morphine, placebo 0.76 mg of morphine, p=0.1741).</figDesc></figure>

A total of 14 patients in the dexmedetomidine group and 6 patients in the propofol group were prematurely withdrawn.Mean RSS scores were similar for the dexmedetomidine (4.5) and propofol (4.7) standard of care groups p=0.259. 11% of the dexmedetomidine group required additional propofol to maintain the Ramsay scores while mechanically ventilated. The median time from stopping the drug to extubation was longer on propofol (145 min) compared to dexmedetomidine (0 min) due to the requirement to stop propofol prior to extubation to allow recovery of the patient's respiratory function. Subjects not requiring morphine were dexmedetomidine 72%, propofol 37% (p&lt;0.001) during mechanical ventilation; dexmedetomidine 69%, propofol 24% (p&lt;0.001) during the 6 hours after extubation and dexmedetomidine 50%, propofol 12% (p&lt;0.001) from start of study drug to 6 hours after extubation.The amount of morphine used was reduced; 0.16 mg/h on dexmedetomidine and 0.61 mg/h on propofol standard of care up until extubation (p=0.0003). There was no statistical difference in time to weaning or time to extubation. Mean total length of ICU stay was comparable.</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Benefit-Risk Balance</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefits Beneficial effects</head><p>There has been a shift in ICU practice in recent years away from an absolute requirement for deep sedation and it is increasingly recognised that lighter levels of sedation with a resultant reduced period of time on a ventilator is desirable. Dexmedetomidine appears to offer a level of sedation comparable to an equivalent dose of midazolam and therefore may have some desirable qualities for patients requiring light to moderate sedation.</p><p>In study 3005013, the mean percentage of time at the target sedation level without use of rescue treatment was 60.7% and 56.6% for dexmedetomidine and midazolam groups, respectively confirming non inferiority for the first co-primary endpoint. As the lower limit of the 95% CI for the estimated ratio between the treatment groups (0.97) was above the predefined non-inferiority margin (&gt; 0.85), dexmedetomidine was proven clinically non-inferior to midazolam. Both PP and ITT population showed consistent results with a better trend in the PP population (ratio: 1.09 versus 1.07) supporting the primary analysis. Although duration of infusion was shorter as observed in the previous study 3005012, longer time at target was observed for dexmedetomidine group as compared with midazolam group (37.75 versus 37.07) supporting non inferiority results. The median duration of mechanical ventilation (i.e., time to being free from mechanical ventilation that was not re-instituted within 48 hours) was 41 hours shorter in the dexmedetomidine group (123 hours) than in the midazolam group (164 hours) in the ITT population.</p><p>In study 3005012, the mean percentage of time at target sedation without use of rescue treatment were 64.6% versus 64.7% for dexmedetomidine and propofol groups, respectively, confirming non inferiority for the first co-primary endpoint. Both PP d ITT population showed consistent results.</p><p>However; ITT results were less convincing than the PP (ratio: 0.97 versus 1.00), although the CI was still above the non-inferiority margin of 0.85.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dexdor</head><p>Assessment report Page 77/79</p><p>The pooled data of phase III studies showed dexmedetomidine to be significantly better than standard </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects.</head><p>There are ICU patients for whom dexmedetomidine will not be able to provide a sufficient level of sedation. Furthermore, there are clinical ICU situations that may not be suitable for the use of dexmedetomidine considering its cardiovascular adverse effects and that no clear dose response has been established, dexmedetomidine is being administered to effect. These uncertainties have been considered manageable via routine pharmacovigilance and adequate labelling.</p><p>In study 3005012, the CHMP was concerned that patients randomised to dexmedetomidine spent on average a substantially shorter time at target (33.51 versus 47.12, ie 14 hours less) suggesting that patients on dexmedetomidine were discontinuing study treatment earlier than those on propofol for reasons related treatment. The number of discontinuations because of lack of efficacy further supported this finding. This uncertainty was addressed by adequate post-hoc analyses. Although, in the design of phase III studies, there is an inherent methodological bias unfavouring dexmedetomidine in that patients who are already established on a sedative at an efficacious dose are likely to enter a period of "instability" when being switched to an alternative sedative, the CHMP noted that in study 3005012, the majority of the patients who were successfully managed on dexmedetomidine did not require more rescue sedation than subjects receiving propofol , achieving a stable sedation.</p><p>In study 3005012, for the second co-primary endpoint, the duration of mechanical ventilation did not differ statistically significantly between treatment groups using different tests (Gehan Wilcoxon :</p><p>p=0.240; Cox HR:0.49, 0.77-1.13). However, from a statistical perspective, the hierarchical approach used for the co-primary endpoints can be considered sufficient to make the study positive.</p><p>Literature suggested off label use of dexmedetomidine, particularly in the paediatric population while there are limited paediatric data. A drug utilisation study to address the issue of off label use has been included as part of the risk management plan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risks</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unfavourable effects</head><p>Maternal and foetal toxicity (including embryo-foetal deaths) in animal studies were noted.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is a specific alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist and its safety profile can be considered well known (e.g. bradycardia, hypotension, reduced cardiac output) and supported by more than ten years of post-marketing experience. No new safety signals have been identified from the clinical studies and post-marketing data.</p><p>Dexdor Assessment report Page 78/79</p><p>Excessive dosing in patients with severe hepatic impairment may lead to over sedation and increase risk of adverse reactions. Dexmedetomidine should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment and that a dose reduction may be considered in this population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects</head><p>It should be noted that the proposed posology is different to that approved elsewhere in the world and this should be considered when interpreting the global post-marketing safety data. Therefore, the safety database for dexmedetomidine is limited regarding patients who required a duration of infusion longer than 24 hours and also those who experienced upper dose range &gt;0.7 µg/kg/h.</p><p>No studies on the use of dexmedetomidine in pregnancy or lactation have been performed and there are no exposures to pregnant or lactating women in the available studies. Considering the pre-clinical data, dexmedetomidine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.</p><p>No clear dose relationship has been established regarding the adverse events profile of dexmedetomidine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit Risk Balance</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects</head><p>Non inferiority versus midazolam and propofol as a standard of care has been established.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is of particular benefit as an additional alternative to achieve desirable sedation level not greater than -3 according to the RASS, in ICU patients considering the current clinical practice.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine also allows further flexibility in the ICU setting for patients who do not require deep sedation and has shown additional advantage in reducing the time for extubation as compared to standard of care. In addition, the safety profile of dexmedetomidine is considered well known based on its extensive clinical and post-marketing exposure and is manageable via routine pharmacovigilance and adequate Labelling. The product is intended for hospital use and should be administered by healthcare professionals skilled in the management of patients requiring intensive care.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit-risk balance</head><p>Having considered the benefits of dexmedetomidine as a sedative agent over the potential and identified risks, the CHMP concluded that the benefit risk balance for dexmedetomidine is positive for the following indication:</p><p>For sedation of adult ICU (Intensive Care Unit) patients requiring a sedation level not deeper than arousal in response to verbal stimulation (corresponding to Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) 0 to -3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Recommendations</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome</head><p>Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Dexdor (dexmedetomidine) "For sedation of adult ICU (Intensive Care Unit) patients requiring a sedation level not deeper than arousal in response to verbal stimulation (corresponding to Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) 0 to -3)." is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation.</p><p>Dexdor Assessment report Page 79/79</p></div>
