<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Information on Paediatric requirements</head><p>• During the November 2012 PRAC meeting the RMP Advice and assessment overview was adopted on 28 November 2012.</p><p>• During the CHMP meeting on 13 December 2012, the CHMP agreed on a list of outstanding issues to be addressed in writing and in an oral explanation by the applicant.</p><p>• The applicant submitted the responses to the CHMP List of Outstanding Issues on 15 February 2013.</p><p>• The Rapporteur's joint Assessment Report was circulated to all CHMP members on 26 February 2013.</p><p>• During a meeting of a SAG on 6 March 2013, experts were convened to address questions raised by the CHMP.</p><p>• During the meeting on 21 March 2013, the CHMP agreed on the consolidated List of outstanding issues to be sent to the applicant.</p><p>• The Rapporteur's joint Assessment Report was circulated to all CHMP members on 4 April 2013.</p><p>• During the CHMP meeting on 23 April 2013, outstanding issues were addressed by the applicant during an oral explanation before the CHMP and a 3rd List of outstanding issues was agreed by the CHMP on 25 April 2013.</p><p>• The Rapporteur's joint Assessment Report was circulated to all CHMP members on 11 July 2013.</p><p>• During the July 2013 PRAC meeting the RMP Advice and assessment overview was adopted on 11</p><p>July 2013.</p><p>• During the meeting on 25 July 2013, the CHMP, in the light of the overall data submitted and the scientific discussion within the Committee, issued a negative opinion for granting a Marketing Authorisation to Delamanid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Steps taken for the re-examination procedure</head><p>• During the meeting on 21 November 2013, the CHMP, in the light of the scientific data available and the scientific discussion within the Committee, the CHMP re-examined its initial opinion and in its final opinion concluded that the application satisfied the criteria for authorisation and recommended the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation.</p><p>• The CHMP opinion, the CHMP assessment report and the translation timetable were re-adopted via written procedure on 5 December 2013. MDR-TB is associated with a considerable mortality rate and poses a significant public health threat. The mortality rate is more than 10% in national treatment programs and has been estimated to be as high as 32% worldwide. Individuals infected with drug-resistant strains who are unable to receive adequate treatment present a considerable public health risk and are capable of spreading primary MDR-TB infection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Scientific discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Introduction</head><p>The current treatment recommendations are based on direct susceptibility testing results to select active agents and on an overall regimen as shown in the diagram.</p><p>Nevertheless, the failure rate for MDR-TB treatment is high. In a recent meta-analysis of studies, which included 4959 patients with MDR-TB from 21 countries over a period of more than three decades, successful outcome (cure or completion of treatment) was reported for only 62% (range: 39-77%) of patients; an unsuccessful outcome was reported for 38% (range: 23-61%) of patients and death for 11% (range: 0-32%) of patients 1 . In a recent study in Latvia in which MDR-TB patients (N=167) were treated under WHO guidelines, 77% of subjects experienced a conversion of sputum culture (over a median duration of 60 days), 23% of patients remained sputum culture positive and 8% died 2 . Similar findings were reported from a study in Peru of 66 patients with MDR-TB who received second-line therapy as recommended by the WHO. Of these 66, 83% achieved probable cure and 8% died while receiving therapy 3 .</p><p>The increasing global burden of MDR-TB and the public health risk have created an urgent need for anti-TB agents with novel modes of action and with activity against multiple drug-resistant strains of M.</p><p>tuberculosis. Worldwide, MDR-TB has become a major barrier to achieving successful control of TB because therapy is less effective, associated with more adverse events and more costly and complex (e.g. takes much longer and involves injectable agents) compared with standard first-line therapy. The critical need in drug resistant TB is further amplified by reports of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), which currently represents approximately 7-10% of MDR-TB isolates. In addition to rifampicin and isoniazid, XDR-TB strains are resistant to any fluoroquinolone and to at least one injectable second-line drug (capreomycin, kanamycin and amikacin) so that treatment options are very limited.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>About the product</head><p>Delamanid (formerly OPC-67683) is a nitro-dihydro-imidazo-oxazole derivative that was discovered by Otsuka in a screen for inhibitors of mycolic acid biosynthesis. Delamanid is practically insoluble in aqueous solution of pH ≥ 4 but it is soluble to some extent in organic solvents and in aqueous solutions at lower pH.</p><p>The antibacterial activity of delamanid is specific for Mycobacteria. Against M. tuberculosis MIC values are typically in the range 0.006 to 0.012 µg/mL and there is no cross-resistance with any of the currently used anti-TB drugs. Delamanid has been developed solely for oral treatment of MDR-TB in conjunction with other active agents.</p><p>The (revised) proposed indication and posology from the applicant was as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Therapeutic indications</head><p>{Delamanid Otsuka} is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary infections due to multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis as part of an appropriate combination regimen (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).</p><p>Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Posology and method of administration</head><p>Delamanid should be administered by physicians experienced in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Posology</head><p>The recommended daily dose for adults is 100 mg twice daily, taken with food, for 24 weeks.</p><p>Delamanid must always be administered as part of an appropriate combination regimen for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) according to WHO guidelines (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).</p><p>Treatment with an appropriate combination regimen should continue after completion of the 24-week delamanid treatment period according to WHO guidelines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Elderly patients (&gt; 65 years of age)</head><p>No data are available in the elderly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Renal impairment</head><p>No dose adjustment is considered necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hepatic impairment</head><p>No dose adjustment is considered necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment. Delamanid is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Paediatric population</head><p>The safety and efficacy of delamanid in children and adolescents below 18 years has not yet been established. No data are available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method of administration</head><p>For oral use. Delamanid should be taken with food.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The development programme/Compliance with CHMP Guidance/Scientific Advice</head><p>The applicant conducted a Phase 2 study in which delamanid (either 100 mg or 200 mg BID) was compared to placebo when each was added to optimized background regimen (OBR) over 8 weeks. After reaching week 8 (Day 56) subjects stopped delamanid/placebo and continued OBR with sampling to Day 84. Subjects were then invited to participate in an uncontrolled follow-on study in which they received delamanid 100 mg BID (with option to receive 200 mg BID after week 2) for a total of 26 weeks.</p><p>With regard to compliance with the TB guideline, the applicant approached clinical development along the lines suggested but only compared delamanid with placebo over 8 weeks.</p><p>There is an ongoing Phase 3 study 242-09-213 with an estimated date of submission in 2015. The study evaluates the efficacy of delamanid 100 mg twice daily (BID) for 2 months followed by 200 mg once daily (QD) for 4 months in combination with an optimized background regimen (OBR) versus placebo + OBR during the 6-month intensive phase of MDR TB treatment. This is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, stratified, placebo-controlled study conducted globally in 2 parallel groups at approximately 15 sites qualified to treat MDR TB. In addition, a sub-study comprises HIV-positive patients on antiretrovirals (ARVs).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Quality aspects</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Introduction</head><p>The finished product is presented as a film-coated tablet containing 50 mg of delamanid as the active substance. Other ingredients are: hypromellose phthalate, povidone, all-rac-α-Tocopherol, microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, sodium starch glycollate, carmellose calcium, colloidal hydrated silica, magnesium stearate and a film coating mixture (consisting of hypromellose, macrogol 8000, titanium dioxide, talc and iron oxide yellow).</p><p>The product is available in alu/alu blisters and amber glass bottles as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Active Substance</head><p>The chemical name (IUPAC) of delamanid is (2R)-2-methyl-6-nitro-2- <ref type="bibr">[(4-{4-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)</ref>phenoxy] piperidin-1-yl}phenoxy)methyl]-2,3-dihydroimidazo[2,1-b] <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">3]</ref>oxazole and it has the following structural formula:</p><p>Delamanid consists of white to pale yellow crystals or crystalline powder. It is practically insoluble in water, slightly soluble in methanol, sparingly soluble in benzyl alcohol and acetonitrile, soluble in acetone, and freely soluble in tetrahydrofuran. It is not hygroscopic.</p><p>Having an asymmetric carbon at the C-2 position of the 2,3-dihydroimidazo[2,1-b]oxazole ring, it is an optically active compound; the R-enantiomer is used. The enantiomeric purity of delamanid is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC. No polymorphs or solvates have been found.</p><p>The chemical structure of delamanid has been verified using elemental and spectroscopic analysis (MS, UV, IR, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR).</p><p>Information on the active substance was provided in an Active Substance Master File (ASMF).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacture</head><p>The active substance is manufactured in three main steps, including final recrystallization. Well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications are used for the active substance synthesis. Critical process parameters have been defined. In-process controls are in place at all critical steps of the synthetic process. Specifications and control methods for starting materials, reagents and intermediate products have been presented.</p><p>During development the manufacturing process has been modified and optimised to improve quality of the active substance, increase yield and decrease environmental impact.</p><p>Detailed information on the manufacturing process of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the AMSF and it was considered satisfactory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specification</head><p>The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, UV), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), optical purity (S-isomer; HPLC), loss on drying, residual solvents (GC), heavy metals, melting point and residue on ignition.</p><p>Each specification parameter was sufficiently justified. Analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated.</p><p>Batch analysis data are provided for 32 batches produced with the proposed synthetic route four of them are of commercial size. The batch analysis data show that the active substance can be manufactured</p><p>reproducibly. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.</p><p>Sufficient information is provided on potential impurities and residual solvents. Levels of impurities found in the batches of the active substance are toxicologically justified and well below specification limits. One genotoxic impurity, which is a reagent in the synthesis, is specified in the active substance.</p><p>The limit was established based on the Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC). Batch results are consistently below detection limit; therefore, skip testing for this impurity is considered acceptable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability</head><p>Three pilot scale batches of the active substance packed in double LDPE bags and fibre drums were put on stability testing as per ICH conditions: under long term conditions (30°C/65%RH) for up to 36 months and accelerated (40°C/75%RH) for 6 months. The stability data show no apparent degradation and very little variability.</p><p>All the results conformed to the specifications for all parameters tested (appearance, identification, optical rotation, melting point, impurities, optical purity, loss on drying and assay). The analytical methods were the same as for release and were stability indicating.</p><p>Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 1 batch and confirmed that delamanid is not light sensitive.</p><p>No changes in the tested parameters were observed for delamanid stored under stressed conditions at The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufacturer by the proposed supplier is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmaceutical Development</head><p>Delamanid is practically insoluble in water and its solubility increases only slightly under a lower pH <ref type="bibr">(under 4)</ref>. Therefore, a complex approach to this oral solid dosage form development was necessary.</p><p>From early development stages, formulation development was focused on dissolution enhancement. Several approaches were investigated; finally a technology showing higher solubility and higher bioavailability compared to tablets produced with active substance in crystal form was selected.</p><p>Delamanid 50 mg tablets with this powder blend have been used throughout the clinical studies since the latter stage of phase I studies. The clinical and intended commercial tablets are exactly the same formula.</p><p>All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur.</p><p>Standards and/or EC directive. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation.</p><p>The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. The compatibility of the excipients with the drug substance has been established during preliminary stability studies.</p><p>A Quality by Design (QbD) approach was applied during development, a risk analysis was conducted to identify the critical points in the manufacturing process and to establish a proven acceptable range (PAR) for each process parameter.</p><p>Critical quality attributes (CQA) were identified for the product, based on the quality target product profile (QTTP). The process parameters in the selected process have been investigated and optimized based on the design of experiments (DoE) result targeting the crystallinity as one of the proposed CQAs.</p><p>Critical parameters to the performance of the product are controlled by a dissolution method which was proved to be of sufficient discriminatory power. The manufacturing process for the powder blend is considered a key process as the dissolution performance of delamanid tablets is highly dependent on the powder blend characteristics. To establish proven acceptable ranges (PARs) for this process, a two-tier DoE with factorial design was performed to evaluate the influence of several process variables on CQAs.</p><p>Cross interaction evaluation indicated that none of the combinations impacted the CQA significantly. In a second step the DoE was repeated with three of the dominating process variables in order to confirm the acceptable operating range around a centre point. Appropriate in-process controls have been put in place.</p><p>PARs which will be applied in routine production were defined and confirmed for other processes.</p><p>For the compression step, a design of experiments was set up and the results indicated the critical parameter with respect to the CQAs. A statistical evaluation is performed to identify the design space and PAR for the critical parameter with respect to the CQAs and a PAR was established which is narrower than the design space.</p><p>The film coating process was successfully scaled up and optimised. From a quality point of view, this step was deemed as low risk and not further investigated during manufacturing process development.</p><p>A discussion was provided on the impact of the batch size on the different manufacturing steps in order to identify the up-or downscaling strategy in the future.</p><p>The finished product contains hypromellose phthalate (HPMCP) as a component of the tablet formulation. There are two potentially toxic substances which may be derived from HPMCP. Sufficient toxicology and batch analysis data those substances were submitted and strict limits were introduced in the finished product specification. As the amounts in the batch analysis were well below the established limits, the presence of hypromellose phthalate in the finished product is considered acceptable.</p><p>The primary packaging is an aluminium/aluminium blister or an amber glass bottle (type III) with polypropylene child resistant closure, polyester insert and desiccant canister(s). The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adventitious agents</head><p>Lactose monohydrate, used as an excipient, is the only material of animal origin which is used in the product. Appropriate declaration confirming compliance with the TSE guideline has been provided by the lactose manufacturer. Lactose is produced from milk obtained from healthy animals under the same conditions as milk intended for human consumption and that it has been prepared without the use of ruminant material other than calf rennet in accordance with the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agent Via Human and veterinary medicinal products.</p><p>Magnesium stearate is of vegetable origin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacture of the product</head><p>The manufacturing process is divided into 4 main steps: preparation of powder blend, blending, compression, film coating.</p><p>The active substance is dispersed in polymer matrix, which is an intermediate in the finished product manufacturing process.</p><p>For the tablet manufacture, tablets are prepared using the powder blend and are mixed with the remaining excipients, in the last manufacturing step, the tablets are film-coated.</p><p>Critical steps of the manufacturing process were identified. Based on the critical quality attributes (CQAs) identified for the product, process parameters for the critical steps were evaluated and the proven acceptable ranges (PARs) were established during the development. The proposed CQAs have been incorporated either in the in-process control or the QC release testing. The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs. The manufacturing process both for the intermediate and for bulk film-coated tablets is validated with three consecutive batches of commercial scale. Validation data demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Product specification</head><p>The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form. The product is tested for appearance, identification of delamanid and tocopherol (HPLC), identification of iron oxide yellow (Ph.Eur.), impurities (HPLC), assay of delamanid (HPLC), assay of tocopherol (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), two specific phthalates-related substances (HPLC), dissolution and microbial purity.</p><p>The acceptance criteria for all specification parameters are justified by batch results and comply with relevant CHMP/ICH guidelines. The degradation products are discussed and specified in the finished product as appropriate.</p><p>All test methods for the finished product control are sufficiently described and appropriately validated.</p><p>Batch analysis results were provided for 3 batches of production scale. Results of clinical batches, manufactured at pilot or smaller scale, are provided as supportive data. All results comply with specifications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability of the product</head><p>Stability studies were conducted on 3 production-scale batches of tablets packaged in the commercial package, glass bottles and aluminum/aluminum foil blisters. The long-term stability study is on-going (25°C/60%RH) and 24 months data are provided; results of completed accelerated studies (40°C/75%RH, 6 months) are available in the dossier.</p><p>Stability studies were also conducted on production-scale batches of bulk tablets packaged in double polyethylene bags/aluminum bag. Additionally, stability study was conducted on delamanid powder blend intermediate.</p><p>In addition, photostability testing was conducted with one batch of exposed delamanid tablets and freeze-thaw cycling studies were completed with tablets packaged in aluminium/aluminium blister packs, glass bottles and bulk packaging. The photostability results show no signs of photodegradation;</p><p>freeze-thaw samples show no degradation or trends in any of the tested parameters.</p><p>The parameters tested include description, identification, impurities/degradation products, dissolution, delamanid assay, tocopherol assay and microbial testing (long-term testing only). For information purpose, additional testing is performed for water content, disintegration, hardness, crystallinity and optical purity. These tests will not be repeated in post-approval stability studies.</p><p>The stability samples were tested using the same analytical methods as for release; the methods are stability indicating.</p><p>Overall, no significant changes were observed in any studies throughout the period tested to date. The overall stability results obtained are similar between the different packaging materials.</p><p>Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are acceptable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4.">Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects</head><p>Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.</p><p>The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and its manufacturing process. However no design space was claimed for the manufacturing process of the finished product.</p><p>The use of HPMCP as a component of the tablet formulation has been justified and the proposed control strategy for the specific phthalates-related substances is acceptable and justified from toxicological point of view.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.5.">Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects</head><p>The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Introduction</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GLP</head><p>The pivotal toxicology and the majority of the safety pharmacology studies conducted by the applicant were reported to be GLP compliant. The safety studies that were not conducted to GLP were conducted to an appropriate scientific standard.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Pharmacology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary pharmacodynamic studies</head><p>The pharmacological mode of action of delamanid involves inhibition of the synthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall components, methoxy-mycolic and keto-mycolic acid. This is observed at lower tuberculosis should be identical. The precise mechanism of action is unknown; however, there is evidence to suggest that delamanid requires metabolic activation by M. bovis BCG in order for the anti-TB activity to be exerted and that this activation is possibly mediated via the deazaflavin-dependent nitroreductase (Rv3547) and F420 coenzyme system. The in vitro frequency of spontaneous resistance to delamanid is high and is almost equal to those for reference compounds, INH and PA-824. Values for moxifloxacin and rifampicin were substantially lower.</p><p>Comparison to other agents has not been included. Mutation in one of the five coenzyme F420 genes fgd, Rv3547, fbiA, fbiB, fbiC is suggested as the mechanism for resistance against delamanid. These seem to be the same enzymes and co-factors as suggested to be responsible for the activation of delamanid. Since these enzymes and co-factors are seemingly non-essential in vitro, as a result, a variety of mutations can give rise to resistance.</p><p>In vivo efficacy of delamanid has been investigated in animal models through investigation of lung, spleen and liver colony-forming unit counts.</p><p>• In mice significant decreases in pulmonary viable bacteria count vs. vehicle control were observed with delamanid ≥ 0.313 mg/kg/day (p &lt; 0.01). Using regression analysis, the effective dose of delamanid (corresponding to the therapeutic dose of rifampicin 3.5 mg/kg/day) was 0.52 mg/kg/day.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>In immunodeficient BALB/c nude or immunocompetent BALB/c mice delamanid showed significant dose-dependent activity at ≥ 0.625 mg/kg/day, measured as reduction of viable bacteria count in lung, liver and spleen. Some activity was observed in both studies at 0.313 mg/kg/day. No clear distinction was seen between normal and nude mice.</p><p>• In a mouse model of TB using M. tuberculosis MDR strains the survival time during an 8-month period following treatment was superior in delamanid-treated mice vs. reference compounds.</p><p>• Studies in guinea pigs also supported in-vivo activity of delamanid.</p><p>It is concluded that studies in mice suggest that once or twice daily treatment with delamanid provides comparable exposures (AUC) and demonstrates comparable efficacy. There was no difference in delamanid activity in normal and immunodeficient mice and delamanid was effective against infection with either MDR-TB or drug-susceptible strains. In a mouse model, early bactericidal activity (EBA) values for delamanid were similar to those for INH and more potent than EBA values for rifampicin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary pharmacodynamic studies</head><p>At the end of the evaluation procedure, the applicant provided a secondary pharmacology study, conducted according to the request of the Agency. The effects of delamanid on a series of receptors, enzymes and ion channels will however be further assessed in post-authorisation phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety pharmacology programme</head><p>A series of safety pharmacology studies have been provided which evaluate the effects of delamanid and its metabolites on the central nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory and renal systems.</p><p>No treatment related effects on the central nervous system were noted at plasma levels that were ~18.5-fold higher than that proposed clinically (following 100 mg BID). In addition, no treatment-related effects on respiratory rate were observed at exposures that were 3.2-fold higher than the maximum proposed C max in humans.</p><p>During a series of safety pharmacology studies performed to investigate the effects on the cardiovascular system, some degree of hERG channel inhibition was observed with delamanid (35.4% at 1.6 µg/mL); no effect on action potential duration was observed during a guinea pig papillary muscle assay (at up to 1.6 µg/mL) and delamanid had no effect on QT interval in vivo following single oral administration in the dog, where plasma levels of delamanid were ≤3.2-fold higher than those observed in man. However, QT/QTc prolongation was observed following repeated administration in the dog and in man.</p><p>The applicant has suggested that the observed QT prolongation in vivo might be due to metabolites of delamanid as the exposures to the plasma metabolites were higher upon repeated administration. The effects of the human metabolites (R)-DM 6701 (=DM-6704), (R)-DM-6702 (=DM-6705), (R)-DM-6703</p><p>(=DM-6706), (S)-DM-6717, (S)-DM-6718, (4RS, 5S)-DM-6720, (4R, 5S)-DM-6721, and (4S, 5S)-DM-6722 were investigated in subsequent studies using HEK-293 or CHO-K1 cells stably expressing the hERG channel. Inhibition of the hERG channel current was observed with (R)-DM 6701 (≥0.5 µg/mL), (R)-DM-6702 (≥ 0.15 µg/mL) and (4RS, 5S)-DM-6720 (0.5 µg/mL) and the most pronounced effects on hERG channel inhibition were observed with the predominant metabolite (R)-DM-6702 (IC 50 0.04 µg/mL).</p><p>Although delamanid and the metabolites (R)-DM-6701, (R)-DM-6702 and (4RS, 5S) DM 6720 could collectively contribute to the observed QT prolongation in vivo; given the time course and the exposures of the metabolites in man, it is likely that the (R)-DM-6702 (DM-6705) is a significant contributor to the observed effect.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Pharmacokinetics</head><p>A series of method validation, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been conducted. With the exception of the pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies, the package is considered to be adequate.</p><p>In fed animals, the absolute oral bioavailability for the jet milled formulation was estimated to be 42.2%, 34.9% and 61.3% in the mouse, rat and dog, respectively. C max and AUC for delamanid generally increased in a less than dose proportional manner and there was some evidence of accumulation on repeated-dosing in the rat and dog. In the dog, food intake caused an appreciable increase in the systemic exposures following oral administration of delamanid. However the "food effect" was less pronounced with the solid dispersion formulation and therefore supports the selection of this formulation for use in humans.</p><p>In vitro protein binding of delamanid and the metabolites (R)-DM-6701, (R)-DM-6702, and (R)-DM-6703 to mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, and human sera was high (≥ 97.4%). Distribution of delamanid and/or its metabolites into the lung was observed in both the mouse and the rat. In the rat, following oral administration of radiolabeled-delamanid, drug-related radioactivity was widely distributed and the highest tissue:plasma ratio was observed in the liver and the adrenal gland, which correlates with the route of elimination and/or the target organ toxicity observed. The radioactivity retention in the eyes of pigmented rats was longer than that observed in non-pigmented animals, which suggests an association of delamanid and/or its metabolites with melanin. Following repeated dosing for 21 days, accumulation of drug-related material was observed and the ratio of radioactivity in the tissues on Day 21 to that observed on Day 1 was highest in the testis.</p><p>Following single oral administration of 14 C-delamanid to pregnant rats, delamanid-related radioactivity crosses the placenta in rats, whereby the concentrations of radioactivity in fetal tissues were greater than or equal to those observed in maternal blood at ≥24 hours post-dose. The fetus:plasma ratios were &gt;1 at 48 and 72 hours post-dose.</p><p>There is some evidence of accumulation of radioactivity within the amniotic fluid and the fetus over time and this most likely contributes to the reproductive toxicity observed in the rat. Drug-related material also distributed into the milk of lactating rats; hence, breast-feeding should be discontinued upon treatment with delamanid.</p><p>Overall, the transformation of delamanid is thought to be mediated primarily by plasma albumin and to a lesser extent, the enzymes CYP3A4, CYP1A1, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1. There is evidence to suggest that the proposed mechanism for the metabolism of delamanid to DM-6705 involves a reaction between the amino groups in albumin and the 5-C of the 6-nitro-2,3-dihydroimidazo [2,1-b] oxazole moiety of delamanid.</p><p>Following single and repeated oral administration to the mouse, rat, rabbit and dog, the plasma levels of the metabolites were consistently lower than that of the parent, with the exception of the metabolite DM-6717 in rabbit plasma. Delamanid and (R)-DM-6702 were identified as the predominant analytes in the mouse, rat and dog (plasma, tissues, urine and/or feces). In the mouse, rat, rabbit and dog, the The question though as to whether all human metabolites have been adequately assessed from a toxicological perspective remains unanswered. Hence, this necessitates a new mass balance study to investigate and profile potential reactive metabolites.</p><p>The potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions at the level of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) have been evaluated. In vitro, delamanid at 5 µM was not a substrate or an inhibitor for P-gp mediated transport and it is noted that the concentration of delamanid was approximately 15-fold lower than the estimated concentration of 74.8 μM in the intestinal lumen (following administration of 100 mg). Hence, an effect at the level of gut cannot be ruled out. Additional studies to evaluate the effects of delamanid and (R)-DM-6702 at a series of transporter systems were conducted. The results of these in vitro transporter-based studies will be further scrutinised in post-authorisation phase.. The results provided thus far suggest that at the concentrations tested (3 to 10µM), the potential for delamanid and (R)-DM-6702 to inhibit BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OCT1 and BSEP is low.</p><p>Overall, the potential for delamanid to cause pharmacokinetic interactions via inhibition or induction of the CYP enzymes investigated thus far is considered to be low. In accordance with the Guideline on Drug</p><p>Interactions, the potential to induce CYP2B6 will also be evaluated. Factors that might potentially affect metabolism by plasma albumin (which could in turn increase the levels of delamanid and thus increase the risk of CYP inhibition or transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions) have not yet been identified.</p><p>However, no clinically relevant changes in the plasma concentrations of delamanid and DM-6705 occurred in MDR-TB patients with hypoalbuminaemia when compared to those with albumin levels within the normal range.</p><p>A drug-drug interaction study with Rifater, which contained rifampin, an inducer of CYP3A4, indicated that the concentrations of delamanid decreased by about 50%; hence there is a need to prohibit co-administration of delamanid with strong inducers of CYP3A4 (contra-indication added to Section 4.3 of the SmPC).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.4.">Toxicology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Single and repeat dose toxicity</head><p>The applicant has presented a series of single and repeated-dose studies in the rat, rabbit and dog whereby delamanid was administered via the oral route for up to 39 weeks. The studies performed are considered appropriate for the proposed clinical duration of 6 months. The systemic exposures for delamanid at the no-effect levels from the 26-week rat study are 4.3 to 16.7-fold higher than the proposed clinical C max which is acceptable. The exposure margins (C max and AUC) based on the no-effect levels from studies in the dog ranged from 0.48 to 1. It is evident that the no-effect levels for the pivotal toxicity studies in the dog were primarily based upon the QT prolongation observed. QT prolongation has been reported in man and some precautions have been included in the SmPC.</p><p>In the rat, alterations in red blood cell parameters (decreased hematocrit and red blood cell count and increased reticulocyte ratio) were observed at exposures in excess of those proposed clinically.</p><p>Interestingly, abnormal values for hematocrit, hemoglobin and red blood cell count were observed during the clinical studies; however, the observed changes from baseline were generally comparable between treatment groups.</p><p>In vivo studies demonstrated a pronounced inhibitory effect of delamanid on blood coagulation, whereby parameters such as PT and APTT were prolonged (mouse, rat, rabbit, but no effects reported in the dog) and the plasma levels of several clotting factors, including factors, II, VII, IX and X, were reduced following administration of delamanid (rabbit). Although measurements did not show a profound impact of delamanid on endogenous vitamin K levels, these studies demonstrated that supplementation with vitamin K 1 could counteract inhibitory effects on coagulation following delamanid administration. An in vitro study conducted with rabbit liver microsomes demonstrated significant inhibition of vitamin K 1 epoxide reductase, a model of endogenous vitamin K 1 formation, by delamanid metabolite DM-6717.</p><p>The data presented thus far therefore suggest that the metabolite DM-6717 has a key role in the interference with vitamin K-dependent coagulation and it is important to note that the exposures to DM-6717 observed at the effective doses were substantially higher than that observed in man. The role of other metabolites of delamanid in these processes has not been entirely elucidated. Although a definitive effect on clotting has not been reported in man, these findings have been summarised in Section 5.3 of the proposed SmPC.</p><p>In the dog, histopathological findings were noted in the liver at ≥ proposed clinical exposures and these findings were not associated with any signs of necrosis. There is clinical evidence to suggest that treatment with delamanid may occasionally cause hepatic damage. Hence, liver disorders have been included as an important potential risk in the risk management plan. In the same species, foamy macrophages were observed in the lymphoid follicles of various organs during the definitive 13-week and the 39-week studies. The incidence and/or degree increased in a dose dependent manner, the finding was shown to be partially reversible and the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.</p><p>These findings have been included within section 5.3 of the proposed SmPC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genotoxicity</head><p>The applicant has conducted a series of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies with delamanid and the metabolites (R)-DM-6701, (R)-DM-6702, (R)-DM-6703 and DM-6718. Delamanid and its metabolites were non-mutagenic and the data therefore suggest that administration of delamanid will not pose a genotoxic risk to humans. Moreover, in the mouse and rat, repeated oral administration of delamanid for up to 104 weeks did not appear to be carcinogenic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Carcinogenicity</head><p>In the mouse and rat, repeated oral administration of delamanid for up to 104 weeks did not appear to be carcinogenic.</p><p>Examination of the rat carcinogenicity study and some of the non-pivotal studies conducted in the rat, rabbit and dog revealed histopathological changes in the adrenal tissues (such as cortical cell hypertrophy, swelling and necrosis of the zona glomerulosa and focal infiltration of the mononuclear cells). These findings occurred at exposures in excess of those proposed clinically and were not observed during the pivotal repeat-dose studies. Moreover, any observed change in adrenocortical function in man (elevation of cortisol levels) was associated with tuberculosis disease and not with delamanid therapy. Hence the observed findings within the adrenal tissues were not considered to be clinically relevant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reproduction Toxicity</head><p>The applicant conducted a series of reproductive toxicity studies in the rat and rabbit to evaluate the effects of delamanid on fertility and embryofetal development. Delamanid had no effect on male or female fertility (rat) at up to 300 mg/kg/day. In the rat, delamanid was not teratogenic at exposures (AUC) that were ~16.7-fold higher than those proposed clinically.</p><p>Embryofetal development studies were also performed with metabolites (R)-DM-6702 and (S)-DM-6718 on the basis that these metabolites represented &gt;20% of drug-related exposure. Following repeated administration of the metabolite (R)-DM-6702, fetal anomalies (oedema) and variations including (thymic remnant in the neck and bipartite ossification of the thoracic vertebral body) were noted at exposures that were 3.6 fold higher than proposed clinically. Following repeated administration with (S)-DM-6718, general oedema of the fetus was noted at exposures that were similar to that proposed in man. In the rabbit, delamanid was not teratogenic at the doses evaluated; however, a slight increase in the incidence of resorptions was noted at 10 mg/kg/day. Although it is feasible that the observed finding may be due to the observed toxicity in the dam (reduced body weight gain), the NOAEL for the effects on the dam and for maintenance of pregnancy is considered to be 5 mg/kg/day. The package of reproductive toxicology studies has addressed all of the identified disproportionate metabolites to date.</p><p>However, the applicant should consider the impact of any significant unidentified human metabolites on the ability to predict the potential to cause reproductive toxicity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Local Tolerance</head><p>Delamanid did not appear to have any ocular irritant effects and was a non-irritant to skin in New Zealand White rabbits</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other toxicity studies</head><p>Data from the whole tissue distribution studies indicate drug-related material is retained within the pigmented eye and that delamanid binds to melanin. There were no clear ophthalmic findings in the repeated dose studies apart from some sporadic occurrences of retinal rosettes at exposures that were 16.7-fold higher than that proposed clinically (pivotal 4 week rat study only). It is noted that these findings were not observed in the definitive 26-week rat study, or in the repeated-dose studies in the dog. Moreover, the applicant has provided in vitro data which demonstrate that delamanid is not phototoxic at concentrations that are well in excess of those proposed clinically (0.41 µg/mL). Taken together the data suggest that proposed dose of delamanid does not pose a risk of phototoxicity.</p><p>The Safety Working Party (SWP) has recently considered the issue of phthalates in medicinal products.</p><p>In order to address concerns with respect to the lack of data concerning the toxicity (particularly the genotoxicity and the reproductive toxicity) of hypromellose phthalate <ref type="formula">(</ref> based on a study conducted according to ICH S2 (R1) Guideline (data to be assessed in post-authorisation phase).</p><p>The applicant has provided data to demonstrate that HPMCP should not have an effect on fertility and early embryonic development. In addition, data from the literature (published in 1972) have shown that sternal deformities occurred in animals treated with HPMCP during embryofetal development studies in the mouse and rat. Similar findings were noted in controls at a slightly lower incidence which made the data difficult to interpret. Moreover, close examination of the publication revealed that in the rat, there was an increase in the incidence of a supernumerary rib and this appeared to be significant at 20 and 200 mg/kg/day. However, it was demonstrated that HPMCP had no effect on the parameters evaluated during the embryofetal development studies conducted in the rat and the rabbit (when compared to that observed with historical controls). The doses of HPMCP evaluated in the rat (900 mg/kg) were substantially higher than that proposed clinical dose; hence, the proposed levels of HPMCP are considered to be qualified from a reproductive toxicity point of view.</p><p>In view of the content of HPMCP in Delamanid tablets as well as the use of process solvent during the manufacturing process the applicant was asked to discuss the potential for formation of specific phthalates asimpurities, and ensure that the amounts within the final product have been adequately qualified. The applicant has evaluated the content of the specific phthalate impurities within the proposed medicinal product. The applicant has confirmed that one specific impurity was not detected within the medicinal product (on release or during the stability studies).</p><p>The applicant has analysed samples of placebo used for the definitive toxicity studies (such as the 26-week rat study, the 39-week dog study and the early embryonic development study), where no toxicity findings were observed. The corresponding human equivalent doses for the rat and dog are 2 and 6-fold higher than the maximum proposed dose of one of the impurities. The applicant has also presented some of the control data from the genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity studies conducted and the results provided suggest that the proposed dose of the impurity does not pose a risk to humans.</p><p>It is evident that the level of the specific impurity in the drug product is fairly low and is lower than the doses shown to have no potential to cause general toxicity, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity in the non-clinical species evaluated. In addition a second potential impurity is not detected. The applicant has agreed to implement limits for these specific phthalates as requested. The log K ow for delamanid exceeds 3, this indicates a capacity for bioaccumulation and a bioaccumulation study was performed in Phase II Tier B. The PEC surfacewater value (4.0 µg/L) was above the action limit of 0.01 µg/L, therefore, a Phase II environmental fate and effect analysis was performed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.5.">Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment</head><p>Delamanid is not readily biodegradable and has no significant adverse effects on aquatic organisms up to and even slightly above the limit of water solubility.</p><p>An aerobic transformation study in aquatic sediment systems was performed. Dissipation of delamanid from the water phases was rapid, due to degradation and adsorption to the sediment layer. Over 10% of delamanid shifted to sediment, which triggered the requirement for a sediment toxicity study. All metabolites detected in the sediment remained below 4.9% of the applied radioactivity. DT 90 values were in excess of 3 days.</p><p>It is evident that the maximum concentrations of delamanid evaluated during the aquatic studies were limited by the very low solubility of the compound, which resulted in PEC:PNEC ratios that were artificially high. However, it is agreed that the risk to the aquatic compartment is likely to be low and no additional studies are required.</p><p>The sediment toxicity study was conducted in accordance to OECD 218. No toxicity was observed and a NOEC of ≥ 100 mg/kg dry sediment was established. In accordance with the Questions and answers document on 'Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use'</p><p>(EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010) the results from the toxicity tests should have been recalculated into standard sediment with an organic carbon content of 10%, according to the following equation:</p><p>The artificial sediment used in the toxicity study has an organic carbon content of 2.4%. The NOEC standard sediment is thus ≥ 417mg/kg. The PEC sediment should also have been corrected for carbon content. However, in any case the PEC:PNEC ratio does not indicate any risk to sediment organisms.</p><p>A bioaccumulation study was performed according to OECD 305. Only one concentration could be tested due to its very low solubility, which is considered acceptable. The bioconcentration potential of delamanid is considered to be low. In conclusion, the applicant has conducted a series of studies to investigate the potential for ecotoxicity. Although some of the studies performed in order to evaluate the effects on the aquatic systems were limited by the solubility of delamanid, the data presented suggest that delamanid will not constitute a risk to the environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.6.">Discussion on non-clinical aspects</head><p>The non-clinical data reveal no specific hazard for humans based on conventional studies for genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, but in rabbit reproductive studies, embryofetal toxicity was observed at maternally toxic dosages. Delamanid /metabolites have shown to be excreted into breast milk.</p><p>The metabolic profile observed in animals was qualitatively similar across the evaluated non-clinical species. It was also clarified that the human metabolites identified to date have been sufficiently evaluated during the toxicology studies. Nevertheless, there are remaining uncertainties regarding the metabolites profile in humans, as the anomaly of the results of the mass balance study in humans has not been adequately addressed.</p><p>Delamanid and/or its metabolites have the potential to affect cardiac repolarisation via blockade of hERG potassium channels. Also, repeat-dose toxicity studies in rabbits revealed an inhibitory effect of delamanid and/or its metabolites on vitamin K-dependent blood clotting.</p><p>Prior to opinion, the applicant provided results from a secondary pharmacovigilance study to evaluate whether delamanid and /or its metabolites have any clinically relevant effects on secondary targets.</p><p>These results will be assessed following marketing authorisation. Finally, the applicant considered hypromellose phthalate not to be genotoxic. However, in accordance with ICH S2(R1) Guideline, an additional study will be submitted.</p><p>In this context, at the end of the evaluation phase, an additional study was submitted in accordance with ICH-S2(R1) Guideline .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.2.">Pharmacokinetics</head><p>The first two studies in man concerned administrations of the jet-milled formulation (242-03-101 and 242-04-101). These studies indicated unsatisfactory absorption. All subsequent studies employed a solid dispersion formulation except for use of a gelatin capsule in the mass balance study. Almost all of the data were obtained by dosing with multiples of the 50 mg commercial film-coated tablets. Pharmacokinetic data were also obtained from one of the two Phase 2 studies of Early Bactericidal Activity (EBA) that used the solid dispersion formulation (242-06-101) and from subjects with MDR-TB enrolled into the Phase 2 studies of safety and efficacy (242-07-204 and 242-07-208).</p><p>Measurements of plasma delamanid and its three primary metabolites (DM-6704, DM-6705 and DM-6706) as well as 5 other metabolites (DM-6717, 6718, 6720-6722) were performed using a specific and sensitive HPLC-MS/MS method. This was linear over the range 1-500 ng/mL for plasma delamanid concentrations and 1-100 ng/mL for concentrations of the metabolites. Urinary concentrations were not determined due to low excretion demonstrated by chromatography and liquid scintillation counts in the mass balance study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Absorption</head><p>The absolute oral bioavailability of delamanid in man has not been determined. Assuming delamanid is not excreted unchanged in humans (based on lack of biliary excretion in non-clinical studies), the delamanid recovered in the faeces after an oral dose in humans would represent non-absorbed drug. On this basis, the observation that 52.9% to 74.8% of the dose was recovered as unchanged delamanid in faeces in the human mass-balance study suggests that 25% to 47% of the delamanid dose is orally absorbed in the fed state.</p><p>A less than dose-proportional increase in plasma exposure to delamanid (and its primary metabolites; see below) was observed across the single and multiple dose studies whether administered in fed or fasting states. In 242-05-001 using single ascending doses of 50-400 mg almost no differences in Cmax or AUC0-∞ were seen between the 50 mg group and the 100 mg group. Although the Cmax and AUC0-∞ at 100, 200 and 400 mg increased with dose escalation, increases were less than dose-proportional.</p><p>Administration of single and multiple doses of delamanid after standard meals to Japanese male subjects in study 242-06-001 did not show linearity for Cmax or AUC. Mean C24h values indicated that delamanid had almost reached a steady state on day 10 in all dosage groups. The estimated accumulation ratios of C24h on Day 10 were 2.92 (±0.60), 3.82 (±0.40) and 2.63 (±0.50) for 100, 200</p><p>and 400 mg daily doses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1</head><p>Additional data on single and multiple doses were obtained in two studies in Chinese subjects (242-08-801-01 and 08-802-01). Following administration of single doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg to fasted male subjects the Cmax and AUC∞ increased with increasing dose but in a less than dose-proportional fashion. After multiple dosing after standard meals Cmax, AUC0-12 and AUC0-24 increased with dose but in a less than dose-proportional fashion. Steady-state was reached after 8 days of dosing. The accumulation ratios and Day 10 plasma profiles are shown below. In the UK study 242-05-101 delamanid was quantifiable in plasma until at least 72 h after single doses and up to at least 144 h after the last dose on day 10. After single doses the mean Cmax, AUCt, AUC24h</p><p>and AUC∞ increased with dose in a sub-proportional manner while median Tmax and mean t½, z estimates remained largely unchanged with increasing dose. Following repeated dosing for 10 days both Cmax and AUC24h increased from Day 1 in males and females, which was consistent with the decrease in clearance (CL/F) estimates. However, Vz/F did not consistently follow this trend. The predicted accumulation ratio estimates ranged between 2.2 and 3.3. Mean Cmax showed less than the predicted accumulation (between 1.5 and 2.3) whereas AUC24h and C24h showed ~ 1.8-3.2-fold and 2.6-4.8-fold accumulation, respectively. There were no consistent differences in accumulation between males and females.</p></div>

On Day 10 delamanid plasma concentrations were slightly higher (~ 1.16-and 1.18-fold) after 100 mg TID compared to 150 mg BID based on mean steady state AUC0-24 and Cmax values, respectively.

The metabolites DM-6704, DM-6705</p><p>and DM-6706 also bound extensively (99.60%, 99.70% and 99.21%, respectively) to human serum proteins. In the mass balance study the whole blood to plasma ratio of radioactivity was consistent and indicated negligible binding of delamanid to whole blood components.</p><p>Across the studies the derived estimates suggested a large V/F for delamanid that increased with dose in relation to the non-dose-proportional behaviour of the drug (i.e. decrease in F with dose). For example, the V/F in healthy subjects was 1100 and 1800 L after 100 mg and 200 mg BID dosing, respectively. Estimates of the apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase (Vz/F) and of Vz/F adjusted for body weight (Vz/F/BW) ranged from 936.5 to 16100 L and from 15.48 to 163.2 L/kg, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transporter studies</head><p>Delamanid was shown not to be a substrate for P-gp transport.</p><p>Delamanid and DM-6705, believed to be principally responsible for QTc interval prolongation, are being assessed as substrates for transporters relevant to absorption (including gastro-intestinal secretion), and to hepatic uptake and biliary excretion, considering no renal excretion is involved. Substrate studies were conducted on transport by P-gp for DM-6705, and on transport by BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OCT1 for delamanid and DM-6705.</p><p>Delamanid does not inhibit P-gp transport at 5 μM (this was the maximum concentration tested due to solubility issues), but this is approximately 15-fold lower than the estimated concentration of 74.8 μM in the intestinal lumen after 100 mg and therefore an effect in the gut cannot be ruled out. It is theoretically conceivable that the concentrations in the gut could be much higher than the concentrations of delamanid tested in the in vitro study.</p><p>Transporter inhibition studies were conducted with delamanid and four metabolites (DM-6704, DM-6705, DM-6718 and DM-6720) based on total percent circulating amount of delamanid entities and their potential for QTc interval prolongation. The results suggest that there is a low potential for inhibition of BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OCT1 and BSEP but the maximum concentrations tested were relatively low.</p><p>The applicant will further address the margins between IC 50 values and hepatic inlet concentrations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Elimination</head><p>In study 242-05-101, concentrations of delamanid decreased in a biphasic manner in the majority of profiles. Across the studies the data suggested that delamanid is eliminated from plasma with a t1/2 of 30 to 38 hours whereas the t1/2 for the metabolites ranges from 121 to 322 hours. In the mass balance study, peak delamanid concentrations occurred at ~ 4-8 h. Concentrations continued to be quantifiable until 96 h after dosing and up to 144 h in one subject. The terminal half-life was nearly 32 h while the apparent clearance (CL/F) was high.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 10</head><p>After 192 h (end of collection period), urinary excretion accounted for just over 3% of the radioactivity dose and was still continuing. Faecal elimination accounted for almost 90% of the administered radioactivity within 96 h. Mean total recovery of radioactivity in urine and faeces amounted to 92.4% of the administered dose. Unchanged delamanid was the major radiolabeled compound in faeces (52.9%</p><p>to 74.8% of the dose). Besides unabsorbed delamanid, DM-6705, DM-6718 and DM-6704 were also recovered in faeces. Delamanid was not detected in urine in the mass balance study. Also, after 10 days of 100 to 400 mg QD dosing in another study, less than 1% of the dose was recovered in urine as DM-6705 and DM-6720; unchanged delamanid was not found in urine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metabolism</head><p>Delamanid is an optically active compound (R-form) with an asymmetric carbon at the C-2 position of the 2,3-dihydroimidazo [2,1-b]oxazole ring. The potential for in-vivo inter-conversion to occur was addressed during 242-04-101 using the jet-milled formulation in which R-/S-enantiomer analysis of Day 10 samples revealed that plasma contained 100% R-enantiomer for parent and each analyzed metabolite (DM-6704, DM-6705 and DM-6706). Therefore, delamanid does not undergo chiral inter-conversion in vivo.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of 8 identified metabolites of delamanid was described in several Phase 1 studies.</p><p>The applicant concluded that delamanid metabolism in humans is generally comparable to that in animal species with some qualitative differences. It was considered that single dose mass balance studies in animals and humans and short-term urine excretion profiles only partially describe the metabolism and excretion profile of delamanid. The applicant proposed that the more relevant analyses concern the concentrations and proportions of delamanid and its metabolites found after 6 months of dosing in MDR-TB patients in 204/208, as described in the next section.</p><p>Delamanid is proposed to undergo primary metabolism to DM-6705 mainly in plasma, which the applicant ascribes to an effect of human serum albumin (HSA). This assertion was supported by the observation that intrinsic clearance of delamanid in plasma (0.224 μL/min/mg of HSA) was similar to that in albumin (0.223 μL/min/mg). Delamanid is stated to be immediately and rapidly metabolized into DM-6705 in plasma by albumin, with a disappearance/formation half-life (at 37°C) of 0.64 hours.</p><p>Metabolism of delamanid to DM-6705 is believed to result from reaction of the amino groups in albumin with the 5-C of 6-nitro-2,3-dihydroimidazo[2,1-b]oxazole moiety of delamanid. Since the metabolites are missing the nitro group of delamanid, they are not further metabolized by HSA.</p><p>Delamanid was minimally metabolised in human liver microsomes and 9000 g supernatant (S9) fractions while the three metabolites (DM-6704, DM-6705 and DM-6706) were stable in human plasma.</p><p>In vitro, delamanid was metabolised by CYP3A4 and CYP1A1 in the presence of NADH and NADPH.</p><p>CYP1A1 involvement was not confirmed in S9 fractions or human hepatocytes. The applicant concluded that only CYP3A4 makes a contribution to the metabolism of delamanid. The predominance of albumin vs. CYP3A4 involvement in the metabolism of delamanid is proposed to be supported by the moderate effect of potent CYP inducers and inhibitors on delamanid plasma exposure (see Interactions).</p><p>As shown in the <ref type="figure">Figure</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 6</head><p>Although the applicant has stressed the importance of the steady-state PK data in patients with MDR-TB over single dose studies in healthy subjects, there remains some difficulty reconciling the proposed metabolic pathway for delamanid with the findings of the human mass balance study (single dose 100 mg capsule; fed state). In this study delamanid in plasma accounted for 45.6% of the total radioactivity (TR) at Tmax (4 h post-dose) but only 3.42% of TR AUCinf.</p><p>Radioactivity remained well above the LLOQ at 192 h. The t1/2 of delamanid and TR were 32 and 180 hours, respectively, reflecting the presence of metabolites with longer t1/2 values than delamanid itself.</p><p>The study report states that none of these 8 known metabolites therefore accounts for the majority of the circulating radioactivity.</p><p>It is of concern that &gt; 90% of circulating radioactivity has not been accounted for. Circulating metabolites present in high concentrations relative to parent drug or relative to total radioactivity are of concern for their potential to cause drug-drug interactions. A quantitative assessment of the contribution of individual metabolites is needed because so little of the total radioactivity AUC is explained. On this basis, the applicant's proposed metabolic pathway is not correct and is incomplete since it points to the presence of other compounds being present that predominate over the 8 characterised metabolites in the early phases of dosing.</p><p>As for delamanid, the metabolites show marked increases in exposure with multiple dosing and some also show this with food. Most seem to show less than dose-proportional kinetics and have elimination half-lives much longer than that of delamanid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacokinetics in target population</head><p>In the Phase 2 study 242-07-204, delamanid was administered for 8 weeks at 100 or 200 mg twice daily with standard meals (550 kcal, 25% from fat) in addition to OBR to subjects with MDR-TB. Full PK profiles were obtained up to 24 h post-dose on each of days 1, 14, 28 and 56. of the Day 56 values by Day 14 and AUC0-24h on Day 56 was 3.4-to 3.5-fold that on Day 1. After cessation of dosing, delamanid t1/2 was 38 h and median plasma concentrations were zero on Day 84.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 7</head><p>Formation of the three primary metabolites (DM-6704, 6705 and 6706) was slow. Each showed flat daily concentration-time profiles without a clear Cmax with a slow increase over time through Day 56. On Day 56, delamanid represented 41% of total drug-related AUC0-24h (parent and metabolites) in plasma.</p><p>Metabolites exceeding 10% of total drug-related exposure (AUC) were DM-6705 (17% to 18%) and DM-6718 (12% to 13%).</p><p>In the 6-month open label Phase 2 study 242-07-208 all subjects commenced 100 mg BID with an option to receive 200 mg BID after an initial 2-week period. Dosing was to be with food but subjects were not hospitalised after week 2, so meals were not standardised. Due to the variable PK sampling times Week 6 for DM-6704, DM-6705 and DM-6706, by Week 10 for DM-6720 and by Week 14 for the others. The Phase 2 population PK model (i.e. built using data from 242-07-204 and 208) reported that for a typical MDR-TB subject (55 kg male, plasma albumin &gt; 3.4 mg/dL), the PK parameters of delamanid (apparent clearance, inter-compartment clearance, central and peripheral volume) were , respectively: CL/F = 39.3 L/hr (95%CI: 37.5 -41.1 L/hr), Q/F = 106 L/hr (95%CI: 92.3 -120 L/hr), V2/F = 624 L (95%CI: 573 -675 L), and V3/F = 930 L (95%CI: 843 -1020 L). In a typical subject on delamanid 100 mg or 200 mg BID, steady state was reached at about 1.5 weeks with a Rac (AUC24h) of approximately 3.1 to 3.5.</p><p>Delamanid exposure was not affected by age, mild renal impairment or drug resistance status (MDR-TB vs. XDR-TB). Delamanid clearance was independent of weight, and exposure-related PK parameters were independent of gender. Only hypo-albuminaemia tended to coincide with higher delamanid CL/F, and possibly more likely a lower F. This is believed to be possibly related to confounding pre-existing physiological conditions (e.g. disease status, malabsorption) in these patients. Among the extrinsic factors, delamanid exposure was not affected by OBR treatment or other concomitant medications.</p><p>Actual differences in delamanid exposure across regions may reflect intrinsic ethnic differences, including body composition, as well as food differences. Intra-subject variability (i.e. estimated from proportional residual variability) was moderate (27% to 39%) and appeared to be highest in 208, reflecting primarily outpatient conditions and therefore more variable food intakes. The regional differences were on average within the range of the 50% difference in exposure observed between the delamanid 100 and 200 mg BID doses, both of which were well tolerated. In addition, post hoc simulations at the 100 mg BID dose across regions in both in-patients and out-patients indicated that delamanid AUC in the European population exceeded 3,500-5500 ng*h/mL in 100% of the population.</p><p>The relative bioavailability of the evening dose was 45% (95% CI: 37% to 52%) higher than the morning dose and 19% (95% CI: 16% to 21%) higher in the non-hospitalised vs. hospitalised setting possibly due to differences in food composition/amount associated with these different settings.</p><p>For 100 mg BID with standard meals the Phase 2 POP-PK model predicted the lowest plasma AUC0-24h = 6395 h*ng/mL during steady-state for a female, non-Asian, hospitalized patient and the highest plasma exposure AUC0-24h =11465 h*ng/mL for a North-East Asian male out-patient with MDR-TB under OBR therapy. Corresponding estimates for 200 mg BID were 9129 h*ng/mL for female non-Asian hospitalized patients and 16306 h*ng/mL for a North-East Asian female out-patient with MD-TB under OBR therapy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special populations</head><p>In the dataset used to derive the Phase 2 population PK model there were 60 (14.8%) subjects with mild No hepatic impaired subjects were enrolled but 9 had ALT &gt; 56 U/L, 41 had AST &gt; 40 U/L, 3 had AST &gt; 80 U/L and 7 had total bilirubin &gt; 1 mg/dL. Hepatic impairment may have an influence on DM-6705 exposure but the applicant concluded from the DDI study with Kaletra (see below) that a major loss of CYP3A4 activity would not result in concentrations &gt; those observed with 200 mg BID in 204/208. In trials 204/208 a trend towards slightly lower DM-6705 concentrations in hypoalbuminaemic patients was observed. The lack of data on patients with severe hepatic impairment has been reflected in the proposed Product Information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacokinetic interaction studies</head><p>See Distribution for details of completed transporter studies and Metabolism for what is known and/or proposed to be the mode of biotransformation of delamanid and its metabolites.</p><p>When delamanid was co-administered with P-gp inhibitors cyclosporin A or verapamil HCl to rats the Cmax was unchanged but the AUC was slightly increased. The slight increase in AUC was not considered to be caused by inhibition of P-gp since Cmax was not affected and delamanid was not shown to be transported by P-gp in a study with human MDR1-expressing cell monolayers. indicate that the likelihood for inhibition potential is remote (I/Ki &lt; 0.1). No inhibition was observed with delamanid so no IC50 or Ki was determined. These in-vitro results indicated that enzyme inhibition in vivo with specific probe substrates can be excluded for delamanid and the metabolites that were tested.</p><p>The worst case scenario for CYP3A4 induction was assessed in a 15 day study with Rifater (isoniazid/rifampicin/pyrazinamide) + ethambutol (242-06-202). Ethambutol and Rifater were administered before and delamanid after a standard breakfast. Subjects were genotyped for CYP2C9, CYP 2C19 and N-acetyltransferase-2 (NAT-2).  By applying the same ratios to the Day 56 plasma levels observed in patients with MDR-TB in study 204 the applicant concluded that co-administration of delamanid with a strong inducer of CYP3A4 would not result in a significant effect on safety or efficacy. It is not really expected that rifampicin and its analogues would be used for the treatment of MDR-TB. However, the value of the data is more related to its predictive capacity for co-administration with other strong inducers. On this basis, there is sufficient concern at this stage and in light of lack of information to prohibit co-administration of strong inducers of CYP3A4 with delamanid (noted as a contra-indication, section 4.3 of proposed SmPC).</p><p>The metabolite/parent AUC ratios with and without Rifater + EMB showed that the ratio was unchanged for DM-6704 (suggestive of mainly decreased absorption) but modestly increased for DM-6705 (0.26 vs. 0.19) and DM-6720 (0.058 vs. 0.028) (suggestive of the presence of induced metabolism). Hence, in addition to an effect on CYP3A4 metabolism decreased absorption possibly due to the number of tablets (15) taken, may have occurred.</p><p>Co-administration with delamanid significantly increased steady state plasma concentrations of ethambutol by approximately 25%. The individual ethambutol PK profiles and the slightly more pronounced change in Cmax than in AUC suggested slightly improved absorption rather than decreased elimination of ethambutol. Ethambutol bioavailability has been shown to be absorption-dependent, as antacids are known to decrease ethambutol bioavailability.</p><p>The underlying reasons are unclear considering the limited information on ethambutol metabolism and considering that delamanid and related metabolites do not show CYP isoform inhibition. This minor change in exposure was considered not to be relevant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>-</head><p>The report states that co-administration with delamanid did not significantly alter steady state plasma concentrations of rifampicin. The GMRs were 1.07 (90% CI 0.69, 1.67) for AUCt and 1.14 (0.78, 1.68) for Cmax. The tables of 25-desactyl rifampicin data show slightly higher plasma levels on dosing with delamanid but no formal analysis was planned.</p><p>-When PK data for subjects with a given NAT-2 genotype were compared, co-administration with delamanid did not appear to alter isoniazid PK.</p><p>-Co-administration with delamanid did not significantly alter steady state plasma concentrations of pyrazinamide.

In 242-07-209 delamanid steady state was reached by Day 14 regardless of co-administered anti-HIV agents based on pre-dose plasma concentrations but none of the metabolites had reached steady state on this day.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 14</head><p>-Kaletra slightly increased delamanid steady-state AUC (ratio 1.22). Marginally higher steady-state exposure of DM-6704 (ratio 1.75) and DM-6705 (ratio 1.28) was observed, while no effect occurred on DM-6720 (ratio 1.03) exposure. The limited impact of ritonavir was deemed compatible with the predominant contribution of HSA to delamanid metabolism and formation of DM-6705 and alternative routes (hydrolysis) in the biotransformation of DM-6705 into DM-6704</p><p>and DM-6706. The more pronounced increase in DM-6704 was consistent with its persistent formation through hydrolysis and is indicative of CYP3A4 being solely responsible for its disappearance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanism of action</head><p>Delamanid is an inhibitor of mycolic acid biosynthesis. It is described as a pro-drug that undergoes reductive metabolism by M. tuberculosis to produce an active free radical. Specifically, it was reported to exert anti-TB activity in M. bovis through bioreductive activation of an aromatic nitro group that is possibly mediated via the F420 coenzyme system. These enzymes have been reported in other mycobacteria including M. tuberculosis and M. africanum with near 100% homology.</p><p>Delamanid inhibited methoxy-mycolic and keto-mycolic acid synthesis in M. bovis BCG with IC50 values of 0.036 and 0.021 µg/mL but the IC50 for α-mycolic acid was &gt; 0.25 µg/mL. While isoniazid also inhibits mycolic acid synthesis it has been reported to inhibit mainly the enoyl-ACP reductase InhA-NDA complex. Since the in-vitro activity of delamanid was unaffected by mechanisms conferring resistance to isoniazid it has been deduced that the precise mechanism of mycolic acid synthesis inhibition differs between the two agents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary pharmacology</head><p>In-vitro susceptibility testing of Mycobacteria mostly employed agar dilution with 14 days incubation at 37 0 C. The agar proportion method generally gave MICs up to 4-fold lower than the agar dilution method.</p><p>There was an inoculum effect (higher MICs of delamanid) detected at &gt; 10 7 cfu/ml. Higher MICs of delamanid were also observed at pH &gt;7 vs. pH 6-7. A comparison of MICs determined using agar dilution against M. tuberculosis showed the following for delamanid in comparison (on a wt/wt basis only) with primary anti-TB agents. Regarding clinical isolates, initially the applicant did not conduct any susceptibility testing against delamanid at baseline in study 204. There is an ongoing effort to retrieve, identify and perform susceptibility testing for as many baseline isolates as possible form study 204. There are inadequate data available during the procedure to support setting of breakpoints by EUCAST.</p><p>In "delamanid-resistant" M. bovis BCG Tokyo (i.e. with much higher than usual MICs), mutations were identified in coenzyme F420 genes fgd, Rv3547, fbiA, fbiB and fbiC, based on HPLC elution profiles and DNA sequencing. When delamanid-resistant M. bovis BCG Tokyo strains were complemented with wild-type genes fgd, Rv3547, fbiA, fbiB, fbiC or both fbiA and fbiB susceptibility was restored (MICs 0.006 to 0.024 μg/mL). These results suggest that mutation in one of the 5 coenzyme F420 genes is the mechanism for resistance of M. bovis BCG against delamanid.</p><p>Investigation of clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis that were "resistant" to delamanid (i.e. growth on solid media containing delamanid at 200 ng/mL) showed that the mechanism of resistance was exclusively due to lack of conversion of delamanid to the desnitro-imidazooxazole form by the bacilli.</p><p>Specifically, clinical isolates from study 208 that showed high MICs of delamanid have been found to contain functional mutations of any of the 5 genes (Rv3547, FGD, FbiA, FbiB and FbiC), resulting in the inability of the bacilli to convert delamanid to the desnitroimidazooxazole. Four (2 from EU) out of 213 (49 from EU) patients had isolates that were confirmed to develop delamanid resistance during the 6-months' treatment period. All of these patients were on effective mono-therapy with delamanid or with only the addition of a weak, bacteriostatic drug to which the patient's isolate was susceptible.</p><p>The spontaneous resistant rate in H37Rv for delamanid is 6.44 x 10-6 -4.19 x 10-5, which is very similar to that of isoniazid: 1.74 x 10-5 -3.13 x 10-5. Therefore, based on the experience with isoniazid, the applicant expects that the rate of emergence of resistance to delamanid will be high unless it is paired with a potent bactericidal drug or multiple bacteriostatic or weakly bactericidal drugs.</p></div>

The time course of QTcF and ΔQTcF and PK (delamanid, DM-6704, DM-6705 and DM-6720) in 242-07-208 indicated that DM-6705 and QTcF values were essentially unchanged from Week 10 onwards.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Participants</head><p>The critical inclusion criteria were as follows: <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 18</ref> The study excluded subjects with ECG abnormalities or laboratory tests indicating renal or hepatic dysfunction. HIV-infected subjects were enrolled if they were not on or requiring ART according to the guidance operative at the time the study was initiated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatments</head><p>The study comprised three periods:</p><p>Pre-treatment Period (Days −12 to −1) for screening and establishing baseline culture status Treatment allocation was stratified by extent of pulmonary TB (i.e. cavitation) so that an equal number of subjects with cavities visible on chest radiograph were allocated to each treatment group.</p><p>Delamanid 50 mg tablets (lot numbers 07F91A050A, 07F91A050B, 07F91A050C) and matching placebo tablets were administered under fed conditions in the morning and evening within 30 minutes of the start of a meal (minimum of 550 calories with at least 25% from fat). The OBR for each subject was selected by the site's lead investigator, who could change the OBR as necessary based on tolerability or DST results at any time during the study. The OBR was to be selected in accordance with the WHO Guidelines for the Programmatic Management of Drug-resistant TB. If a subject's organism was resistant to a higher number of second-line anti-TB medications or the subject had problems tolerating some of the second-line medications the OBR could consist of &lt; 4 medications. Note that moxifloxacin was not allowed in any OBR in this study due to the QTc effects.</p><p>After completion of 56 days of delamanid + OBR all subjects were to continue treatment with OBR alone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives</head><p>The primary objective was to evaluate the safety, efficacy and PK of 2 doses of delamanid (100 mg BID and 200 mg BID) administered orally for 56 consecutive days + OBR vs. placebo + OBR to subjects with pulmonary, sputum-culture-positive MDR-TB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcomes/endpoints</head><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of the subset of MITT subjects (sputum culture positive for MDR-TB at baseline) that achieved SCC using the MGIT system by Day 57. The time to SCC was based on the collection of the first sputum specimen with MGIT culture negative for growth of MTB that was followed by at least one additional sputum specimen with no MTB growth in MGIT at least 27 days after the first negative specimen and not followed by any sputum specimens with MGIT growth of MTB at any point during the remainder of the 84 day study period.</p><p>Morning sputum specimens were to be collected on Day −1, Day 1 and <ref type="bibr">Days 8,</ref><ref type="bibr">15,</ref><ref type="bibr">22,</ref><ref type="bibr">29,</ref><ref type="bibr">36,</ref><ref type="bibr">43,</ref><ref type="bibr">50</ref> and on the day after stopping delamanid/placebo (57) for culture using the MGIT system and solid media. Spot sputum sampling was to be conducted prior to the morning meal whenever possible on Days 63, 70, 77 and 84 during the Post-treatment Period. Induction of sputum was used as needed. The</p><p>Company states that standardised mycobacterial methods were used (as per CLSI) but the "comprehensive laboratory manual" was not included in the dossier.</p><p>Secondary efficacy endpoints included analyses of SCC based on solid culture media and other measures of anti-mycobacterial effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample size</head><p>Relying largely on microbiological data using solid culture media, it was estimated that adding delamanid would result in 60% of subjects achieving SCC after 56 days of treatment compared with 40% on OBR alone. Based on this effect size, a study with 120 fully evaluable subjects per treatment arm would have 80% power to detect this 20% treatment difference at type I error = 0.025 (2-sided)</p><p>using a 2-sample Chi-square test. The study finally randomised a total of 481 subjects to insure that at least 360 subjects would have full data available for the primary efficacy analysis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conduct of the study</head><p>A particular issue regarding microbiology data was the report of false positive results in MGIT at sites 001 (66 patients) and 009 (16 patients). Only cultures from these sites that were definitively identified as MTB were reported as such in the database. Site 009 was placed on temporary hold due to GCP compliance issues and it was later decided that no further subjects should be enrolled. Some microbiology data from this site were considered questionable due to the GCP compliance issues, so a sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint was performed without the microbiology data from</p><p>Site 009.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baseline data</head><p>The treatment groups were well balanced in terms of baseline characteristics. About two thirds were male, ~ one quarter was of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity and just over half were described as Asian. The age range was from 18-63 years.</p><p>All subjects had an abnormal chest radiograph consistent with the diagnosis of TB at baseline. More than two-thirds had cavitation and 24% had bilateral cavitation. Rates of signs and symptoms were comparable between treatment groups except for haemoptysis, which was reported by 32.9% and 37.5% in the delamanid groups vs. 46.9% in the placebo group.</p><p>Overall, 433/481 (90.0%) had received prior treatment for TB for at least 30 days, including 243/481 (50.5%) who had been treated with a first-line regimen only. At randomization major changes to treatment mostly involved drugs being added rather than stopped. The highest proportion of patients had no change in regimen content with respect to injectables, fluoroquinolones or pyrazinamide (range 40.3 -60.4% in each OBR class). During the study, the majority (51%) of patients had no change to their OBR with respect to these drug groups (72% for injectables; 83.8% for fluoroquinolones; 38.8% for pyrazinamide).</p><p>Overall, 63.6% of Day 1 sputum specimens were positive for MTB complex using both MGIT and solid culture media, 15.8% were negative in both, 17.3% were positive using MGIT and negative using solid culture media while 3.1% were negative using MGIT and positive using solid culture media. Isolates were not speciated within the MTB complex.</p><p>Day 1 susceptibility test results were available for MTB isolated from 399/481 subjects enrolled. It was later clarified that susceptibility testing was only performed for isolates from MGIT and not from solid culture. It was established that testing susceptibility to delamanid was not performed at baseline in this study but it remains possible that some data could be provided assuming that the strains have been deposited in the applicant's NJ repository. There were 27/399 isolates susceptible to isoniazid and/or rifampicin, with 5 missing results for each drug. Rates for other first and second line agents varied. In both ITT and MITT populations and using MGIT and solid culture data a higher proportion of placebo subjects had XDR-TB (e.g. MITT rates were 22% for placebo vs. 17% and 13% in the delamanid groups;</p><p>p-values slightly less than 0.05).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Numbers analysed</head><p>A total of 402/481 (83.6%) subjects qualified for the MITT population defined as subjects who had a positive sputum culture for MDR-TB at baseline using the MGIT system. The PP data set based on the Outcomes and estimation SCC rates by MGIT up to Day 57 were statistically significantly higher in the two groups treated with delamanid (100 mg BID 45.4%; 200 mg BID 41.9%) vs. placebo [p = 0.0083 and 0.0393, respectively]). For subjects with cavitation the proportions achieving SCC were also statistically significantly higher for delamanid vs. placebo. For subjects without cavitation the differences were not significant for either delamanid group vs. placebo or overall for delamanid vs. placebo. For SCC rates based on solid culture media data, statistically significantly higher proportions in the delamanid groups achieved SCC regardless of cavitation.</p></div>

The results for the two delamanid groups were comparable.</p><p>In The analysis of sputum culture negativity at Day 57 without consideration of subsequent culture results in the MITT population showed numerically but not statistically higher rates for delamanid vs. placebo, regardless of the presence of cavitation.

EBA assessed as a function of AUC0-24h from all patients was weakly correlated with EBA at Day 14 (i.e. a higher AUC0-24h was associated with greater decrease in log-CFU counts). This association no longer held when only patients with an AUC0-24h above 3500 h*ng/mL were considered.</p><p>The applicant concluded that the threshold of AUC0-24h for maximum bactericidal efficacy was between 3500 and 5500 h*ng/mL. </p></div>

The final dataset for the integrated analysis of 242-07-08 and 242-10-116 reported on 87.5% (421/481) of the patients initially randomised into 204 (not all had confirmed MDR-TB at baseline). Of these 421 patients 53.4%</p><p>were from Asia and 66% were men.

All other patients who chose to participate in 208 received a different dose of delamanid for at least some period of time vs. the dose they were randomised to receive in 204. Also, patients entered 208 at different time points relative to their participation in 204 -54.5% within 2 months but 37.6% after a gap of more than 4 months.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 21</head><p>The analysis of sustained effect was based on the mITT population (i.e. sputum culture positive for MDR-TB at baseline) and on the solid culture data (rather than the MGIT data). In this analysis the applicant combined all data for delamanid (i.e. regardless of the dose[s] used).</p><p>Additionally, the applicant assessed sustained SCC after 8, 6, 2 or 0 months of treatment with delamanid. For this the results for groups of patients receiving 8 or 6 months were combined into one group for analysis of delamanid treatment ≥ 6 months (n = 192 patients). The remaining 229 patients who received 2 months of delamanid (156 patients) at either dose or placebo (73 patients) and who received no further treatment with delamanid during the remainder of MDR-TB treatment were combined into one group for analysis of delamanid treatment ≤ 2 months. The total of 192 treated for at least 6 months and 229 treated for &lt; 2 months is 421, which implies the analysis was not confined to the proven MDR-TB population (402 by MGIT and 347 by solid culture).</p><p>For time to sustained SCC over the full treatment period, the Kaplan-Meier curve of the delamanid treatment ≥ 6 months group had a substantial increase above the curve for the delamanid treatment ≤</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 22</head><p>Both curves reached a relative plateau at approximately 11 months. Although a large proportion of patients were treated for a total of 24 months, the Kaplan-Meir curves stop after approximately 20 months for the delamanid treatment ≥ 6 months group and 16 months for the delamanid treatment ≤ 2 months due to the fact that no additional patients achieved SCC beyond those time points.</p><p>The applicant concluded that the results from this survival analysis demonstrate that patients treated with delamanid ≥ 6 months experienced accelerated SCC that was sustained throughout the treatment period and that overall a higher proportion of these patients achieved sustained SCC compared to those treated with delamanid ≤ 2 months (including those who never received delamanid).</p><p>As shown in the table below (which is confined to the 301 with MDR-TB on solid culture at 204 baseline who chose to be followed; note that the XDR-TB group is a subset of the MDR-TB) by the end of treatment 90.9% (130/143) in the delamanid ≥ 6 months group achieved sustained SCC compared to 70.9% (112/158) in the delamanid ≤ 2 months group. Among the patients in the delamanid ≤ 2 months group, out of 48 who had no treatment with delamanid at any time, 37 (77.1%) achieved sustained SCC.</p><p>This compares with 75 out of 110 (68.2%) of those who received delamanid for a maximum of 2 months.</p><p>Assessment report EMA/55567/2014 <ref type="table">Table 28</ref> In the subset of XDR-TB patients in the delamanid ≥ 6 months group, 77.5% (31/40) achieved sustained SCC compared to 41.7% (5/12) patients in the delamanid ≤ 2 months group.</p><p>The full ITT population of 421 patients who agreed to participate in 116 was assessed for final treatment outcomes. The outcomes were determined by clinicians managing the patients' care and were based on a given patient's clinical status, including sputum culture status, at the end of treatment. Definitions for the outcomes were based on those outlined in the WHO guidelines and were subsequently grouped as favourable or unfavourable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 29</head><p>Favourable outcomes were significantly increased in patients in the delamanid ≥ 6 months group vs. ≤ 2 months group and mortality was also reduced (2 vs. 19). Also, 42/73 (57.5%) patients who received no treatment with delamanid during the 24-month treatment period had a favourable outcome and 6/73 (8.2%) died.</p><p>The applicant considered that the 73 that did not receive delamanid can serve as a control group for the overall analysis. This group, which is anyway a subset of the 229 in the ≤ 2 months group, showed a comparable favourable response rate vs. the total treated for no more than 8 weeks.</p><p>The applicant proposed that the fact that substantial numbers received more than one dose of delamanid throughout 204/208 is addressed by the results of 204 at week 8 that relate to only one assigned dose. The applicant also concludes that the results are conservative since a much greater proportion in the delamanid ≥ 6 months group had XDR-TB vs. the ≤ 2 months group (22.9% vs. 5.2%). In the smaller subset with XDR-TB the results are shown below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 30</head><p>The applicant also provided several additional analyses in an attempt to support a lack of bias resulting from the lack of randomisation of subjects into study 208 and the fact that follow-up in study 116 was according to subject volition.</p><p>However, CHMP questioned the reliability of these further analyses. It is not possible to agree that the results of 208 and 116 are without potential bias. Even if the data from 208 and 116 were to be accepted they fail to support a recommendation for 100 mg BID delamanid. The available datasets actually do not support any clear conclusion regarding the dose, they only point strongly to the insufficiency of 8 weeks delamanid.</p><p>To further explain the problem over and above the fact that 208 was not a randomised study, that the dose used was decided by the physicians for individual patients and the comparison between delamanid and placebo was limited to 8 weeks, it should be noted that of the patients randomised into 204: -44% did continue to 208 -28% did not have the possibility to continue (delayed start up 23% + site did not participate 5%) -28% could have enrolled in 208 but did not either because they withdrew during 204 (10%) or completed 204 and chose not to continue to 208 (18%)</p><p>This large proportion (28%; including 18% who completed 204) of patients who could have continued into study 208 but did not, creates the possibility that the sample continuing into 208 is subject to selection bias. One way of assessing whether the sample in 208 could be biased would be to compare those patients who did continue with those who did not.</p><p>From the group originally randomised to delamanid, it was observed that at the end of study 204 (after 2 months) for the ITT population the SCC rate based on PI favourable outcome was 85/126 (67.5%) in those who went into 208 vs. 91/156 (58.3%) in those who did not. For the mITT population SCC rates at the end of 204 for those randomised to delamanid were 71/107 (66.4%) for those who went into to 208 and only 68/127 (53.5%) for those who did not. These observations pointed to concern that the 208 population is subject to selection bias and that the bias favours delamanid in that response rates in the group that continued into 208 are likely to be biased upwards. All the subsequent presentations, including those of death rates, were considered to be flawed and difficult to interpret because of the potential for selection bias (see also: "Ancillary analyses").</p><p>Study 242-09-213 was designed to confirm and extend the results observed in 204 and is ongoing.</p><p>Results for the co-primary endpoints of proportion with SCC and time to SCC over 6 months will be available within the first quarter of 2014. Top line results on 30 month outcomes and the final report will be available in 2016.</p><p>The study compares:</p><p>-OBR for 18-24 months with placebo for the first 6 months -Delamanid 100 mg BID for 2 months + 200 mg QD for 4 months plus OBR for 18-24 months Follow-up will continue for 30 months after randomization (i.e. 6-12 months post OBR). The study includes a comparison of the SCC rates at 8 weeks (one of the co-primary endpoints) and will allow for comparisons of time to SCC and declines in time to positivity in the MGIT system.</p><p>The study also examines 3 other aspects: -Approximately, 40 HIV positive patients on ART will be enrolled in sites in South Africa and there is a modified protocol describing special procedures required for these patients, including additional blood draws, analysis of genetic polymorphisms potentially affecting the metabolism of anti-retroviral drugs and a requirement for hospitalization for at least the first 10 weeks.</p><p>-Moxifloxacin will be allowed provided that the patients are hospitalized for the first 10 weeks </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Updated mortality data</head><p>In a supplementary analysis, as requested by the CHMP following the oral explanation, the applicant focused on updated mortality data. Information had been collected on a total of 37 deaths among 464 patients for whom vital status was known. All deaths except 2 occurred prior to day 771 and the analysis concentrated on 14 deaths in the placebo group and 21 deaths in the delamanid group (35 deaths in the ITT population) as well as on 32 deaths that occurred in the mITT-MGIT population.</p><p>Mortality data were shown for 4 groups according to the actual treatment received:  <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 31</ref> To further explain this subset analysis it is pertinent to recall that there were 213 patients enrolled into 204 who continued in study 208 (44% of the 481 randomised) and 192 of these were followed up in study 116. However, considerable proportions of those who entered 208 received a different dose of delamanid vs. the dose assigned in 204. This is why the numbers in the 100/100 and 200/200 groups are small relative to the total initially randomised to delamanid that participated in both 204 and 208.</p><p>These results show the value of a period of delamanid administration greater than two months to achieve a significant treatment effect and mortality reduction. The 2 M DLM group shows a more limited treatment effect with a 23% reduction in mortality relative to the No DLM group. Though consistent with a treatment benefit for delamanid this is not statistically significant.</p><p>Nevertheless, caution is needed when viewing these data. It should be recalled that the proportion with XDR-TB at baseline in study 204 was highest in the total patients randomised to placebo (27% vs. 13%</p><p>and 17% in the delamanid groups). Also, in the following table for 299 patients as described in the table heading there is a higher failure rate for those who received delamanid but a much higher default rate in the OBR only group. These observations point to a conclusion that those did not enter 208 (a substantial proportion of whom chose not to enter rather than being at sites where participation became impractical) were also more likely to default from OBR. This fact adds to the questionable validity of the overall comparisons that have been made according to "actual treatment" received.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 32</head><p>The results for the three randomisation groups (100 mg BID, 200 mg BID and Placebo) were as follows: <ref type="table">Table 33</ref> Each of the three randomisation groups reported in the table included those who did and did not enter study 208. The death rates in the initial delamanid groups and in the initial placebo group cannot be related to any treatment effect of delamanid due to the mixture of actual regimens that each group received in accordance with participation or no participation in 208. Hence, it is no surprise that there is little appreciable difference in death rates between the three initial randomised groups.</p><p>As shown below the combination of achieving SCC by 2 months and longer duration of delamanid treatment yielded the lowest risk of mortality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 34</head><p>The highest mortality rates occurred among patients who neither achieved 2-month SCC nor participated in 208. Among those patients failing to achieve 2-month SCC, the 100 mg BID group has the lowest proportion (36.9%) of patients participating in 208 and the placebo group has the highest proportion (43.1%). This may explain in part why the mortality rate in the 100 mg BID group is not significantly lower than the placebo group.</p><p>The association of 2-month SCC and mortality for the Otsuka 204 patients was assessed for 386/402 patients in the mITT MGIT population (96.0%) with known vital status. Among the patients achieving 2-month SCC, 2.7% died during MDR-TB treatment or during the average 2 years of follow up after treatment, compared with 11.9% of those who did not achieve 2-month SCC. The relative risk of death for patients who did not convert is 4.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 35</head><p>The association of 2-month SCC and mortality was adjusted for covariates indicative of more severe disease in bivariate models to see if the magnitude of effect of 2-month SCC was changed. Participation in the open-label extension trial was also included as a covariate to ensure that it had no impact on the strength of the association of 2-month conversion and mortality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 36</head><p>The MGIT result at week 8 and sustained SCC cannot be assessed since sustained SCC was captured in 116 using solid culture data only. In the population positive at baseline in 204 by solid culture and with a PI outcome in study 116, an association between the month 2 result and final outcome is apparent particularly for those with SCC at week 8. However, more than half of those without SCC at 2 months went on to a favourable outcome and just under half did not.</p><p>It is important to take into account this table since the applicant's proposal is essentially that the comparison with placebo over only 8 weeks in 204 predicts a long-term benefit. In reality the available data cannot be used to confirm this supposition because of the variable management of patients after</p><p>week 8 that would be reasonably expected to affect outcomes. To further explore the possible treatment effect of delamanid in the reduction of mortality, 5 of the actual treatment groups were analysed. All of these analyses show a reduction in mortality associated with the treatment of MDR-TB with delamanid. In all cases the relative risk of death for the delamanid group is presented relative to the placebo group.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of main study</head><p>The following table summarises the efficacy results from the main study supporting the present application. This summary should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.3.">Discussion on clinical efficacy</head><p>The integrated analysis of the combined set of data does not provide sufficient evidence of meaningful benefits for MDR-TB patients from treatment with delamanid 100-mg BID for 6 months added to an OBR compared to those treated with OBR alone.</p><p>The applicant provided two Position Papers -one to support the Combined analysis across 204/208/116 (the critical results are shown above) and one (reflected in the PK/PD analysis) to support the dose of participate in an open label extension trial (study 208), designed to the safety and efficacy of delamanid during 6 months of treatment. All subjects (&lt; 50% of the number randomised into study 204) who entered in trial 208 (i.e. whether or not they received delamanid in 204; which was not known when entering 208) initially received delamanid for two weeks at 100 mg BID after which the physicians could increase the dose to 200 mg BID. Hence, the randomization allocation of trial 204 (100 mg BID or 200 mg BID or placebo) was not respected and the two treatment groups created were not comparable with respect to prognostic factors. The submission also reported outcomes (vital status and solid culture status) from patients who elected to be followed in trial 116. This was an observational study designed to capture additional data and final treatment outcome for patients who participated in trial 204 whether or not they participated in trial 208.</p><p>The single pivotal study with a primary analysis at week 8 is insufficient. To support the indication claimed by the applicant there should have been a comparison of delamanid vs. placebo over a continuous 6-month treatment period. Patients themselves selected to be treated in study 208 and only 213 out of 481 randomised into 204 chose to enter. Some of the initial 481 patients never had the chance to enter 208 because this extension study could not be initiated at some sites in time to allow their participation. Patients who had achieved SCC in 204 were more likely to enter 208 than those who did not. Outcomes at the end of trial 208 are therefore subject to unknown bias and therefore cannot be interpreted. It is also not possible to interpret with confidence the solid culture or mortality data collected in trial 116.</p><p>Regarding the delamanid dose regimen, many of the analyses presented to attempt to address the deficiencies of the trial designs were based on pooling of the dose groups. The lack of an adequate comparison with placebo cannot be addressed by comparing outcomes in 116 or vital status between the very small numbers that actually received a single dose level of delamanid (i.e. only 100 mg or 200 mg BID throughout 204/208) or did not receive any delamanid throughout (i.e. placebo in 204 and declined to enter 208).</p><p>Comparisons between 100 mg and 200 mg BID are also subject to bias, as in trial 208 the dose was selected, not randomised. This would be expected to bias against the higher dose as patients would only be up-titrated if they were felt to "need" the higher dose i.e. those treated with 200 mg BID in 208 may represent a population in a poorer general state. Despite this there were several trends in the data to suggest that 200 mg BID, at least for the initial 8 weeks, followed by 16 weeks at either dose might be the better regimen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy data and additional analyses</head><p>Despite the concerns regarding interpretation of the data, the small number of patients who only received one of 100 mg BID, 200 mg BID or no delamanid at any time, raise several concerns. For example, the solid culture data collected in trial 116 show no difference between the applicant's proposed dose of 100 mg BID for 24 weeks and the group that never received delamanid.</p><p>Added to these problems is the heterogeneity of the study population. In the MITT population 17% and 13% in the two delamanid groups had XDR-TB vs. 22% in the placebo group and the outcomes by sub-group clearly showed lower SCC rates in the XDR-TB patients regardless of the treatment given.</p><p>This baseline imbalance in XDR-TB has potential to make the overall benefit of delamanid vs. placebo in the study (i.e. for all mITT patients) look better than it really was.</p><p>Regional enrolment and outcomes also illustrated the difficulties of interpreting the overall findings when the population included MDR and XDR-TB. The answer clarified that a single site in SE Asia contributed 150 patients to study 204. Not unexpectedly, removal of this site (~ one third of patients) from the analysis resulted in loss of statistical significance for SCC rates between delamanid 100 mg BID Assessment report EMA/55567/2014 groups and placebo based on the primary (MGIT) analysis.</p><p>The MGIT SCC rate with 100 mg BID was considerably higher at this single SE Asia site, where there was no XDR-TB, compared to other sites (e.g. vs. NE Asia where plasma exposures were comparable with SE Asia but there were more XDR-TB cases). Also, the solid culture SCC rates at the SE Asia site were highest compared to other regions for both delamanid dose levels. As such, the overall efficacy for delamanid 100 mg BID and overall in 204 appears to have been driven to some considerable extent by the results from the single site in SE Asia that enrolled 150 out of 481 patients. In accordance with the CHMP guidance regarding provision of a single pivotal study, these findings add to the doubts regarding the robustness of study 204.</p><p>In the applicant's separate Position Paper to further support selection of 100 mg BID the PK/PD analysis attempts to identify a threshold delamanid exposure associated with efficacy. From this, the applicant has concluded that exposure to delamanid in study 204 was above the threshold for maximum efficacy as no association between a further increase in plasma exposure and increase in efficacy was observed.</p><p>Hence, as long as exposure comparable to that in trial 204 is achieved, other factors such as morphological conditions of the host (cavitation), concomitant OBR therapy and corresponding susceptibility or duration of MDR-TB would have to be considered to explain individual differences in efficacy.</p><p>The CHMP however remains critical of this conclusion. The analysis of SCC vs. AUC and TTP vs. AUC is based on only 8 weeks treatment. Whether or not patients achieved SCC based on MGIT was not solely due to delamanid. Also, the study population was heterogeneous in terms of MDR/XDR (with a slightly higher proportion with XDR-TB in the placebo group that may be at least partly responsible for the TTP results).</p><p>These issues weaken the discriminative capacity of the analysis to confirm a lack of association between dose (based on AUC at steady state) and MGIT SCC. Such an analysis cannot supplant and/or overturn the few actual data that can be gleaned regarding the comparison of 100 mg vs. 200 mg BID. The attempt to establish a threshold AUC correlating with maximal efficacy from the EBA study data is also not considered reliable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional expert consultation</head><p>The advice of an Ad-Hoc Expert Group was sought on the following aspects:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy &amp; Drug Resistance</head><p>1. Expert opinion was sought on the fact if comparison of delamanid vs. placebo over 8 weeks suffices to predict the treatment effect of 6 months therapy?</p><p>The group was not confident that this is indeed possible. The experts were concerned that the data to</p><p>Week 8 included too much heterogeneity. Indeed, in their view, the data are clearly subject to influence according to region/site. Treatment groups were imbalanced in the proportion of patients with XDRTB.</p><p>Open-label data from 208/116 do not further add in confirming the treatment effect.</p><p>2. Do the data adequately support the proposed posology for 100 mg BID for 6 months? If not, can an alternative dose regimen and/or duration be suggested as more appropriate?</p><p>The experts agreed that although there is some evidence of efficacy obtained with a 100 mg bid regimen, there is also some indication that a 200 mg bid could be more appropriate, but with the caveat of potential concern about QTc prolongation and drug interactions. It could however be advantageous to explore other dosages (e.g. in between 100-200 mg), taking account of the appropriate precautions.</p><p>3. It was asked if the experts consider that the ongoing Phase 3 trial is adequate to confirm the proposed posology?</p><p>The experts noted that in trial 213, the dosage schedule differs from the one used in the presently submitted 8 -weeks controlled trial 204. The group considered that possibly 200 mg OD for 4 months could be an acceptable dose (as proposed), whilst large uncertainties remain regarding the optimal treatment dose for the first 2 months: should it be 100 mg BID or an initial higher dose? Ultimately, a right balance needs to be struck between the higher probability in achieving reliable SCC across the range of MDR/XDR-TB and risk of extensive QTc prolongation. Also, retaining a contra-indication in using moxifloxacin as part of the OBR seems to deviate from reality of clinical practice. Hence, drug interactions between delamanid and fluoroquinolones (including moxifoxacin) should be adequately addressed (note: moxifloxacin will be allowed in trial 213, protocol amendment).</p><p>Although, the ongoing phase 3 trial will not adequately confirm the currently proposed posology (100 mg BID), the ultimate contribution of the proposed trial on the overall B/R balance of delamanid, will ultimately depend on the strength of its findings.</p><p>4. The experts were asked to consider if the results obtained at 8 weeks can be widely extrapolated across MDR patients taking into account the regional variations observed and the SCC rates for</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XDR-TB?</head><p>An overall recommendation could not be made on this. MDRTB and XDRTB represent a spectrum of TB with various resistances.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.</head><p>It was requested to comment on how the prescribing information might be amended to minimise the potential risk that use of delamanid along with other poorly effective agents could select for resistant organisms?</p><p>The group stressed that where available treatments are very limited, every effort should be made to combine with other agents showing evidence of an effect against the resistant pathogen, and the decision to use should be according to expert advice. The risk for the patient and the public health implication due to potential emergence of resistance should be part of the consideration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional efficacy data proposed by the applicant as a specific obligation in the context of a conditional MA</head><p>Ongoing study 213 will further try to confirm the efficacy of delamanid in MDR/XDR-TB patients.</p><p>The study compares OBR for 18-24 months with either placebo or delamanid for the first 6 months.</p><p>The dose regimen of delamanid is 100 mg BID for 8 weeks followed by 200 mg QD to complete a total of 6 months.</p><p>However, the CHMP has doubts whether indeed this constitutes the optimal dose regimen to provide best chance of achieving reliable SCC across the range of MDR/XDR-TB patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.4.">Conclusions on the clinical efficacy</head><p>There are several issues regarding the design and conduct of 204 that raise serious doubts regarding the robustness of the data to demonstrate the treatment benefit of delamanid at either dose vs. placebo and to support the applicant's proposed delamanid dose regimen.</p><p>In particular:</p><p>a) The duration of comparison between delamanid and placebo is too short to be able to discern the benefit of adding delamanid at either 100 mg or 200 mg BID to an optimised background regimen for 6 months. Study 242-07-208 cannot repair this major deficiency since it does not allow for an assessment of SCC rates vs. placebo over the applicant's proposed duration of use of delamanid (6 months). In addition, the data obtained in both 208 and 116 do not allow for a robust assessment of sustained SCC and must be viewed with much caution since patients self-selected to enter study 208 and to be followed in trial 116.</p><p>b) There are inadequate data to identify the dose of delamanid that should be used. The data obtained in 208 and 116 cannot provide a reliable conclusion regarding the most appropriate dose regimen as doses used in study 208 were selected and not randomised. It is also of concern that the magnitude of benefit of delamanid 100 mg BID vs. placebo based on MGIT SCC rates at week 8 was substantially driven by the result for this dose at a single site that enrolled 150/481 patients where no patient had XDR-TB.</p><p>There is a critical need to substantiate the efficacy of delamanid at a final proposed dose regimen with an adequate comparison vs. placebo over 6 months.</p></div>

The increased incidence of TEAEs for women vs. men was apparent for the majority of SOCs although rates among women in the delamanid BID groups were not higher than rates among women in the placebo group except Investigations and Renal and Urinary Disorders. In the Renal and Urinary Disorders SOC no specific PT contributed to the observed difference. In the Investigations SOC, the difference was due to ECG QT prolonged (13.0% vs. 8.2%), which reflected the overall effect of delamanid in this respect.</p><p>To explore whether the difference in incidence of TEAEs by gender may be related to body weight and delamanid exposure the applicant provided plots for delamanid AUCss by gender. Separate plots for each delamanid dose group showed a similar pattern.

The Population PK data also showed slightly higher delamanid exposure in SE Asia in the 100 mg BID and 200 mg BID groups vs. other regions combined. However, the predicted delamanid exposure at steady state based on the average body weight in men and women by region showed very similar delamanid exposures despite the slightly lower body weight observed in women.</p><p>In 242-07-208 there were no new clinically important TEAEs relative to those reported in 204 and no meaningful increases in the incidence of any TEAEs vs. 204. In particular, the incidence of TEAEs of QT interval prolongation did not increase in study 208 vs. either delamanid treatment group in trial 204.</p><p>From the listing it seems that 0-2 TEAEs of any one type were considered to be severe in intensity and for the majority there were no TEAEs considered severe.</p><p>The table summarises the most commonly reported AEs by treatment group in 204 and pooled for delamanid doses in 208 In study 204, TEAEs for which the total rate for delamanid was higher by &gt; 5 percentage points vs.</p><p>placebo included nausea, vomiting, headache and prolonged ECG QT (37/321, 11.5% vs. 6/160, 3.8%).</p><p>For all of these events, the rates were also higher in the delamanid 200 mg vs. 100 mg BID group.</p><p>More subjects in the delamanid 100 mg and 200 mg BID groups <ref type="bibr">(26/159, 16.4% and 22/158, 13</ref>.9%, respectively) had a ≥ 5% decrease in body weight compared with placebo (10/157, 6.4%).</p><p>The table shows TEAEs in 204 that occurred at a rate higher by 3 percentage points for delamanid (either dose) vs. placebo.</p></div>

On Day 1 she had a potassium level of 3.2 mEq/L, which dropped to 1.9 mEq/L on Day 7, when she had worsening anaemia, sinus tachycardia and QTcB prolongation (from Day Assessment report EMA/55567/2014 -1 468 ms to 541 ms; this decreased to 397 ms on Day 8 after the hypokalaemia had been treated).

On Day 7 she developed respiratory failure, was intubated in ICU but on the next day had two cardiac arrests and died. ms, which was not an increase from baseline.</p><p>There were another 21 deaths in the registry study 116, for which cause of death was not recorded.</p><p>These subjects were not taking delamanid. The median time from last dose of delamanid to death was 231.5 days, with a range from 3 days to 705 days.</p><p>Six of the 24 total patients who died did not receive delamanid. Among 18 that did receive any delamanid, 6 cases had actually achieved SCC in 204 or in 208 without a documented reversion. In all except 3 instances death occurred at &gt; 100 days after the last dose of delamanid. The other three had intervals of 3 days (case in 204), 15 days and 63 days.</p><p>During the procedure, information was collected on a total of 37 deaths by means of study 116 as well as review of TB program records at sites where 204 was conducted. These data were analysed in support of efficacy and are described in the previous section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Severe adverse events</head><p>Overall, 74 patients in 204/208 reported SAEs. No new clinically relevant SAEs were reported in 208 vs.</p><p>204. QT interval prolongation was reported as an SAE for 2 patients. Most SAEs in 208 occurred 4 months or longer after starting treatment with delamanid. Those occurring in &gt; 1 patient are shown in the table.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 47</head><p>In 242-07-204 the overall incidence of SAEs was slightly higher for the pooled dose delamanid group (36/321, 11.2%) vs. placebo (14/160, 8.8%). Rates for individual SAEs were mostly comparable except for prolonged ECG QT (16/321, 5.0% vs. 3/160, 1.9%). Prolonged QT was considered by the investigator as possibly related for 9/16 of those treated with delamanid. Rates were 7/161 (4.3%; 5 related) for 100 mg BID and 9/160 (5.6%; 4 related) for 200 mg BID. None of the three SAEs of this type on placebo were considered related and no event was accompanied by clinical symptoms. SAEs of hypokalaemia were reported for 2 subjects in the delamanid 200 mg BID group but were not considered to be related by the investigator.</p><p>One 32-year-old Asian subject became pregnant after receiving 200 mg BID in study 204 and 100 mg BID in study 208. She conceived approximately 34 days after the last dose of delamanid.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Laboratory findings</head><p>In 242-07-04 clinically significant abnormal chemistry values were most frequently observed for uric acid, potassium, sodium and albumin. Hyperuricaemia was the only parameter for which the proportion of subjects with clinically significant abnormal values was higher for the total delamanid group <ref type="formula">(</ref> One SAE of thrombocytopenia and a case of leucopenia were considered possibly related to delamanid and treatment was discontinued for both subjects.</p><p>Haematuria was the most frequently reported TEAE related to urinalysis but was reported for a lower percentage in the total delamanid group vs. placebo (2.5% vs. 3.1%). Other than haematuria for one subject none of the TEAEs related to urinalysis abnormalities were considered by the investigator to be potentially drug-related, none was serious and none resulted in discontinuation.</p><p>Regarding the potential for hepatotoxicity, the Asian male who died in study 208, having also received delamanid in 204, is described above. The cause of the liver injury was felt to be most likely liver hypoxia secondary to right ventricular failure. He did not have elevated bilirubin by laboratory evaluation, although he was reported by the investigator to have a TEAE of hyperbilirubinaemia. The investigator assessed the events as cardiac failure and hepatic injury, possibly related to the investigational medicinal product (IMP). The assessment was based on the observation that the patient had a relatively good Karnofsky score (80%) prior to the event, the OBR drugs were not new to the patient, the LFTs improved after IMP discontinuation, the secondary lung infection had not worsened appreciably at the time of the event, and the IV fluid given to improve liver function was not large enough to cause cardiac decompensation (there was global cardiac failure, which was refractory to diuretic and other treatment).</p><p>Based on the Hy's Law criteria the patient did have AST 20 x ULN and ALT of 10 x ULN at 3 days after elevation was first noted and the day before values were clearly rapidly declining. One additional patient did meet the criteria for Hy's law but the event was not considered to be related to delamanid. This case was reported in 208 following closure of the database for the interim report for the dossier filing. The patient was an 18-year-old male who received delamanid 200 mg BID during 204</p><p>and had no TEAEs related to liver abnormality. At Day 99 in 208, when he was also taking 200 mg BID, he had an acute hepatitis event (AST/ALT 40 x ULN and bilirubin 6.6 x ULN). Viral hepatitis A, B and C were ruled out by appropriate testing. The patient was taken off all medications including delamanid and the event subsided. The investigator deemed the event due to pyrazinamide, a frequent cause of elevated transaminases and bilirubin in TB patients that has been associated with liver failure and death.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunological events</head><p>Thus far there seem to be very few TEAEs reported as "hypersensitivity" in the database and very few other TEAEs that could potentially represent allergic reactions to treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions</head><p>There is a risk of co-administration of delamanid with other agents that can prolong QTc. This is an important fact to be communicated to healthcare professionals.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Beneficial effects</head><p>The pivotal trial for establishing efficacy and safety of delamanid in MDR-TB patients was the randomised placebo-controlled phase 2 trial 242-07-204. The demonstration of the efficacy of delamanid was based on the increase in sputum culture conversion (SCC) after 2 months of delamanid treatment given in combination with OBR.</p><p>Follow-on studies (208 and 116) aim to provide support to the sustained efficacy of delamanid.</p><p>During 8 weeks treatment with delamanid 100 mg or 200 mg twice daily in study 204, a higher proportion of subjects with pulmonary tuberculosis caused by organisms that were at least resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid achieved SCC compared to the placebo group: in 45.4% of the patients treated with delamanid 100 mg BID, 41.9% in patients treated with delamanid 200 mg BID, and 29.6% in patients treated with OBR only (MGIT media); for patients with XDR-TB these figures were 4/24 (17%), 5/18 (28%) and 2/27 (7%).</p><p>As such, the magnitude of the difference vs. placebo in the MITT population varied by dose group, MDR-TB vs. XDR-TB, presence of cavitation, region and whether the analyses were based on MGIT or solid culture media results.</p><p>The applicant's integrated analyses showed that delamanid use for ≥6 months (any combination of doses) yielded a sustained culture conversion in 91% of patients with MDR-TB (130/143), and in 78%</p><p>(31/40) in those with XDR-TB. Of note though, among 48 MDR-TB patients who had no treatment with delamanid in 204/208 at any time, 37 (77.1%) achieved sustained SCC (on solid culture media). This compares with 75 out of 110 (68.2%) of those who received delamanid for a maximum of 2 months.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects</head><p>The comparison between delamanid and placebo was restricted to 8 weeks only, which is insufficient. In principle, there should have been a comparison of delamanid vs. placebo over a continuous 6-month treatment period. In addition, the data to Week 8 are clearly subject to influence according to region/site, at least part of which reflects the rates of XDR-TB.</p><p>The open-label data from 208/116 reflect patient decisions to continue with open-label treatment, investigator decisions to change the dose and willingness of patients to be followed up for final outcomes (24 months). As such, the reliability of the additional integrated analyses is questioned. Also, the available datasets do not support any clear conclusion regarding the appropriateness of the recommended dose regimen (100 mg BID).</p><p>Actual results for the relatively small numbers who were proven to have MDR-TB at baseline in trial 204 </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unfavourable effects</head><p>Delamanid is associated with prolongation of the QTc interval that is driven predominantly but not wholly by plasma levels of a major metabolite DM-6705.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects</head><p>The total safety database, consisting of two delamanid dose groups and placebo in the first study and uncontrolled use of delamanid in the second study, is limited.</p><p>The potential for delamanid to be associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity is uncertain and would need further characterisation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit-risk balance</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects</head><p>The actual benefit of delamanid cannot be established from the data provided. The efficacy in terms of sputum culture conversion of the two investigated doses (100 mg BID and 200 mg BID) was superior to placebo, but the duration of comparison was too short. The results of the follow-on studies are difficult to interpret. These data cannot address the essential deficiencies of study 204 and the available results cannot confirm the appropriateness of the applicant's proposed dose regimen for delamanid.</p><p>The main safety issue observed with delamanid relates to QT-prolongation, albeit no associated cases of ventricular tachycardia /torsades de pointes were observed. Further on, hepatotoxic potential cannot be dismissed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit-risk balance</head><p>On current evidence, the benefit-risk balance of Delamanid in treatment of pulmonary infections due to multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis as part of an appropriate combination regimen is deemed unfavourable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion on the benefit-risk balance</head><p>MDR-TB is defined as TB caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin. It represents a significant unmet medical need in Europe and developing countries. MDR-TB is associated with a considerable mortality rate and poses a significant public health threat. New medicinal products that can be used in combination with existing therapies are therefore much needed.</p><p>Delamanid, a nitro-dihydro-imidazo-oxazole derivative, provides a novel mechanism of action. It has been developed for clinical use against MDR strains of M. tuberculosis, as part of combination therapy.</p><p>Efficacy results (superiority outcome) were obtained in phase-2 pivotal trial 242-07-204. All patients were diagnosed for pulmonary, sputum culture positive MDR-TB and received an optimal background regimen (OBR). Patients were randomised into 3 groups and received 100 mg BID delamanid, 200 mg BID delamanid, or placebo, in combination with OBR (BID), and sputum culture status was assessed weekly; SCC was measured after 2 months of treatment. The overall data are however difficult to interpret. The duration of comparison between delamanid and placebo is too short to be able to discern the benefit of adding delamanid at either 100 mg or 200 mg BID to an optimised background regimen for 6 months. Study 242-07-208 cannot repair this major deficiency since it does not allow for an assessment of SCC rates vs. placebo over the applicant's proposed duration of use of delamanid (6 months). In addition, the data obtained in both 208 and 116 do not allow for a robust assessment of sustained SCC and must be viewed with much caution since patients self-selected to enter study 208 and to be followed in trial 116.</p><p>In addition, there are inadequate data to identify the dose of delamanid that should be used. The data obtained in 208 and 116 cannot provide a reliable conclusion regarding the most appropriate dose regimen as doses used in study 208 were selected and not randomised. It is also of concern that the magnitude of benefit of delamanid 100 mg BID vs. placebo based on MGIT SCC rates at week 8 was substantially driven by the result for this dose at a single site that enrolled 150/481 patients where no patient had XDR-TB.</p><p>The adverse events profile for Delamanid has been established in a limited safety database, comprising approximately 900 individuals. Delamanid was generally well tolerated. However, potential hepatoxicity cannot be dismissed and needs further investigation. The predominant concern regarding use of delamanid is the effect on QTc. Hypoalbuminaemia (particularly below 2.8 mg/dl) is identified as a major contributing factor. Also, caution has to be applied if delamanid would be administered with quinolones to construct an adequate regimen for treating MDR-TB. Of note, moxifloxacin was contra-indicated during the phase-2 study programme.</p><p>Finally, the metabolic fate of delamanid remains largely unexplained, due to apparently anomalous results obtained in the human mass balance study.</p><p>Based on the available data, a positive benefit-risk balance of this medicinal product cannot be established, which precludes the granting of a conditional marketing authorisation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ground 1</head><p>The duration of comparison between delamanid and placebo is too short to be able to discern the benefit of adding delamanid at either 100 mg or 200 mg twice daily to an optimized background regimen for 6 months. Study 208 cannot repair this major deficiency since it does not allow for an assessment of SCC rates vs. placebo over the applicant's proposed duration of use of delamanid (6 months). In addition, the data obtained in both Trials 208 and 116 do not allow for a robust assessment of sustained SCC and must be viewed with much caution since patients self-selected to enter Trial 208 and to be followed in Trial 116.</p><p>The Applicant proposes 3 lines of data supporting the sustained efficacy of delamanid in MDR-TB patients:</p><p>1. The data from Trial 204 to demonstrate a sustained benefit in SCC out to 3 months from the 2 months of treatment with delamanid at either dose in that trial.</p><p>2. Analysis of 2-month SCC, sustained SCC, and mortality in Trials 204, 208, and 116 to demonstrate sustained efficacy and reduced mortality.</p><p>3. The association between 2-month SCC and the longer term efficacy of MDR-TB treatment demonstrated by the Collaborative Group data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Analysis of data from Trial 204 on efficacy of delamanid</head><p>The primary endpoint pre-specified for the randomized, controlled Trial 204 was the proportion of patients achieving sputum culture conversion (SCC) within 2 months by measuring mycobacterial growth incubation tube (MGIT). The results were an increase relative to the placebo group in the proportion of patients achieving SCC of 45% and 42% for 100 mg BID and 200 mg BID dosing groups, respectively.</p><p>A key secondary endpoint was the time to SCC, shown with the Kaplan-Meier curve analysis. The curve for the two delamanid groups are nearly superimposed and separate from the placebo curve by day 28 (one month) and the separation continues to increase during the second month. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proportion negativity at each time point</head><p>Controlled data on sputum culture status was available up to 3 months (Day 84) in Trial 204 since to meet the definition of 2-month SCC, a patient was required to have achieved a negative culture by 2 months in the trial as well as in the 4 subsequent weekly cultures.</p><p>The proportion of culture results that are negative at each time point have been used to determine sustained efficacy. This is different from conversion, since it does not require a confirmatory negative culture but the proportion negative is a useful population measure of the efficacy of treatment. <ref type="figure">Figure   26</ref> below illustrates the proportion of all culture results that are negative at each time point.</p></div>

TTP is a measure of bacterial load in sputum and an increase in TTP indicates a lower bacterial load. The TTP in the delamanid groups separates from the placebo group at Day 29 and the difference between the delamanid groups and the placebo group remains statistically significant through Day 50 ( <ref type="figure">Figure 27)</ref>. Overall, in a regression model, the reduction in bacterial load is estimated to be 22-27% faster in the delamanid groups compared to the placebo group.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology:</head><p>The database for this analysis was assembled from a larger database of 9,153 patients from 32 MDR-TB treatment cohorts assembled to provide a robust evidence base for the 2011 update for the WHO Guidelines for the programmatic management of drug resistant tuberculosis.</p><p>[7] The database includes patient information from 10 cohorts with agreement from the principal investigator to analyze the data in that cohort and 2,942 of these patients were included in the analysis. The Applicant claims that the meta-analysis is methodologically rigorous following methodologies outlined by the baseline. The patients in this subset had demographic, geographic diversity and clinical characteristics similar to the large data set of 9,153 and that homogeneity of study results for association of SCC and mortality demonstrated qualitatively in forest plots and quantitatively (p=0.07).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Methods:</head><p>Pooled estimates of the effects for each of the outcome measures were calculated using both fixed-effect and random-effect models. Data for each outcome variable were presented in 2</p><p>x 2 tables and for each of the cohorts. The crude odds ratios (OR) were then adjusted for cohort and then for cohort plus one other clinical or demographic covariate available in both the collaborative group and Otsuka Trials databases. In brief, 93 studies of MDR-TB or meta-analyses of MDR-TB cohorts were identified. Of these, 26 publications were excluded because they represented the same or overlapping cohorts and an additional 35 cohorts were excluded because the authors did not respond or could not provide the required individualized patient data. The remaining 32 cohorts included data on 9,898 patients, of whom 410 were excluded since they had XDR-TB, 208 were excluded because they had no treatment information and 127 were excluded with extra-pulmonary TB, leaving 9,153 patients for analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis and Results</head><p>One of the key findings of this meta-analysis was that whether SCC was measured at 2-months, 3-months or 6-months, a similarly strong association of SCC and a reduction in the odds of mortality was noted. The Odds Ratio for mortality, given SCC, was 0.20, 0.15 and 0.12 when SCC was measured at 2-months, 3-months or 6-months, respectively <ref type="table">(Table 52</ref>). This indicates that SCC measured as early as 2 months serves as a meaningful predictor of long-term outcome, in this case mortality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 52</head><p>One hypothesis for why achieving 2-month SCC is associated with a reduced likelihood of mortality is that those who achieve SCC earlier are most likely to achieve sustained SCC. In turn, those with sustained SCC are most likely to survive to the end of treatment and during follow-up.</p><p>This was observed among patients in the Collaborative Group meta-analysis <ref type="table" target="#tab_42">(Table 53</ref>). The Odds Ratio for achieving Sustained SCC, given that the patient achieved 2-month SCC, was 12.7. The Odds Ratio for mortality, among those achieving Sustained SCC was 0.08. This means that after SCC at 2 months, there is a &gt;12-fold chance to achieve sustained SCC and the odds of survival are 90% higher. These results are consistent with the biological hypothesis for the observed association of 2-month SCC and a reduction in mortality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall Results from Otsuka Dataset consistent with Analysis of Collaborative Group Dataset</head><p>The results from the analysis of the overall data from the Otsuka MDR-TB program (irrespective of treatment with delamanid) were consistent with and are supported by the analysis of the Collaborative Group data. The association of 2-month SCC with mortality and sustained SCC and the association of sustained SCC and mortality are very similar <ref type="table">(Table 54</ref>). The magnitude of effect is very similar in all cases. These three associations are consistent with the proposed hypothesis that delamanid increases the proportion achieving 2-month SCC which in turn increases the proportion achieving sustained SCC and finally that those achieving sustained SCC have a very low risk of mortality.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of Delamanid Dose Justification</head><p>The dose-response relationships were explored using the antibacterial efficacy, measured as SCC, TTP between 3500 an 5500 ng*h/mL. Thereafter, in a longer-term trial utilizing a split/BID dosing to further optimize exposure, the original initial bactericidal range appeared to be validated. The threshold was further evaluated using a nonlinear mixed-effect modeling approach with delamanid exposure and TTP data, which indicated a threshold of about 6000 ng*h/mL in XDR-TB-negative patients or 7000 ng*h/mL in XDR-TB patients. In addition, the intraquartile odds ratio analysis indicated no significant differences between delamanid 100 mg and 200 mg BID on the probability of conversion and a plateau in efficacy was reached with the exposures beyond that associated with delamanid 100 mg BID.</p><p>In summary, the delamanid exposure following the 100 mg BID regimen is well above the threshold indicated by the EBA trial, the exposure-TTP analysis, and the nonparametric logistic regression.</p><p>Increased delamanid exposure, beyond that from the 100 mg BID regimen, does not result in increased efficacy. While the 200 mg BID regimen provides higher plasma concentrations and AUC 0-24h , it also resulted in increased incidence of adverse events as well as the QTc interval, a marker for cardiac toxicity.</p><p>Since the exposure of delamanid in trial 204 was above the threshold for maximum efficacy, it is unlikely that differences in delamanid exposure are a discriminating factor for differences in antibacterial efficacy (conversion/non-conversion or bacterial load reduction measured by TTP). As long as exposure above the threshold is achieved, other factors such as morphological conditions of the host (cavitation), concomitant OBR therapy and corresponding susceptibility or duration of MDR-TB would have to be considered to explain individual differences in efficacy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Justification for Delamanid Treatment Duration</head><p>The proposed treatment duration with delamanid in MDR-TB therapy is 6 months. The 6-months treatment duration for delamanid is justified following analysis of durability of sputum conversion through determination of final sustained SCC. Durability of delamanid's antibacterial efficacy was assessed by comparing sustained final SCC at the end of MDR-TB therapy 20-24 months after the start of Trial 204 between patients treated with delamanid for ≥ 6 months and patients treated for ≤ 2 months. The results indicated that patients treated long-term with delamanid 100 mg BID and 200 mg BID + OBR showed notably and clinically meaningful higher rates of sustained SCC (92.3%) than delamanid 2 month or OBR only treated patients (73.4%). Furthermore, consistent with 2-month efficacy results, sustained SCC rates for 200 mg BID were not significantly higher than for delamanid 100 mg BID. These results clearly support the proposed 100 mg BID regimen administered for 6 months to MDR-TB patients. It should be noted that a total SCC of around 90% is very much in the range of bacterial clearance in other bacterial diseases like CAP.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy &amp; Drug Resistance</head><p>1. Does the SAG consider the applicant's claim that the short term efficacy results obtained in the placebo controlled trial with delamanid may be used as a proxy to predict the long-term maintenance effect of delamanid, taking into consideration the evidence published in the literature and the results of the meta-analysis which highlight the correlation between SCC results after 2 months and treatment effect at 6 months?</p><p>According to the SAG, do the 2-month SCC results together with the evidence of the correlation existing between results at 2 month and results at 6 months provide sufficient demonstration of delamanid efficacy for use in patients with limited options?</p><p>Despite the imbalances in groups in MDRTB and XDR-TB numbers and recruitment sites in trial 204, the experts agreed that there is evidence of efficacy over an initial period of 8 weeks treatment. Based on the experience of the experts there is a significant possibility that indeed it could maintain effect in use over the later phase of treatment. However, the less than perfect evidence so far available from trials 208 and 116, cannot rule out the possibility that delamanid would behave like pyrazinamide and lose its effect over a variable period. Nevertheless, based on the fact that a confirmatory trial is awaited soon to complement the current evidence, the level of efficacy demonstrated over 8 weeks in a superiority setting could be used preliminarily as a proxy for efficacy.</p><p>2. Can the results obtained at 8 weeks be widely extrapolated across MDR patients taking into account the regional variations observed and the SCC rates for XDR-TB?</p><p>Bearing in mind the reservations about the small numbers and some imbalance in sub-groups studied, such as XDR TB cases, there is nevertheless no clear evidence that any of these groups failed to show a response.</p><p>3. Is the overall evidence provided by the applicant to support the selection of the 100mg BID dose as opposed to the 200 mg dose (for treatment over 6 months), sufficiently robust and adequate?</p><p>If not, can the SAG suggest an alternative dose regimen and/or duration that might be more appropriate?</p><p>Data available from the trials cannot confirm 100 mg bid to be the optimal dosage. This is based particularly on mortality outcomes (in which 200 mg bid appears to outperform placebo and 100 mg bid), although it was recognized that the long term data are potentially biased as no randomization took place. The group recommends that whilst 100 mg bid might be a starting point, 200 mg bid and maybe equivalent once daily dosage (i.e. 400 mg OD) could be explored as alternatives. Most members felt that such dose should be explored in studies which may be differently designed and more discriminating than those completed so far, even from the beginning of the treatment course (thus to be employed over the whole course). At the same time it was reflected that co-administration with other medicines with an effect on QTc prolongation calls for some caution in the conduct of studies with higher doses.</p><p>4.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Discussion on grounds for re-examination</head><p>The CHMP assessed all the detailed grounds for re-examination and argumentations presented by the applicant and considered the views of the ad hoc expert group meeting held on 15 November 2013.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ground 1</head><p>The CHMP noted that delamanid 100mg bid versus placebo (in both arms added to OBR), proved superior in terms of achieving SCC at month 2 of therapy <ref type="formula">(</ref> With regard to whether the proven short term measure of efficacy is predictive for long-term patient outcome, the applicant asserted that patients who achieved 2-month SCC in trial 204 (irrespective of receiving delamanid) and then enrolled in trial 208 to receive 6 months of delamanid treatment had the highest level of sustained SCC (and very low mortality), especially compared to those patients who did not achieve 2-month SCC and then did not enroll in trial 208.</p><p>CHMP remarked that enrolment in follow-on trial 208 did not further inform opinion on sustained efficacy due to recognised methodological flaws, such as open-label treatment, investigator decisions to change the dose and willingness of patients to be followed up for final outcomes (24 months). Also, there was an important time gap in rollover between trials 204 and 208 (with delamanid interruption of at least 2 months for 50% and up to 4 months for &gt; 38 % of enrolled subjects in trial 208). As such, the reliability of the additional integrated analyses is questioned. Thus, the strength of the evidence of delamanid efficacy on long-term, is limited by the lack of a direct and sound proof of continuous benefit for at least 6 months, since study 208 is biased by the inadequate design.</p><p>However, the CHMP took into consideration that, the experts concurred that indeed two months SCC could be a proxy for long term outcome in MDR-TB. The value of 2 months SCC as important prognostic factor for outcome has been proposed in several studies, such as the one discussed by Ahuja SD et al.</p><p>(2012).</p><p>Notwithstanding the uncertainties and limitations of data from the submitted literature references and the additional meta-analysis, the CHMP considered that, on balance, the SCC results obtained in trial considers the following measure necessary to address the missing longer term efficacy data in the context of a conditional MA:</p><p>"completion and submission of the final study result of the ongoing confirmatory trial examining delamanid added to optimal background regimen in licensed indication (Phase 3 trial comparing delamanid 100 mg BID for 2 months + 200 mg QD for 4 months plus OBR for 18-24 months versus OBR for 18-24 months with placebo for the first 6 months)".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ground 2</head><p>It is appreciated that data obtained from double-blind, randomized trial 204 fully informed the selection of dosage for use of delamanid. The applicant performed various analyses to demonstrate that delamanid assessed at 100 mg and 200 mg twice daily, showed similar results for all efficacy endpoints.</p><p>The applicant argues that exposures from both dose regimens were above the threshold for maximum efficacy and no association between increased plasma exposure and increased efficacy was observed.</p><p>Doubling of the daily dose, therefore, would not give added benefit and could potentially increase risk for patients on MDR-TB therapy. It is also argued that the analyses of trial 204 demonstrate the consistency of the delamanid benefit compared to placebo across all regions and the extent of resistance.</p><p>The CHMP considered that doubts remain if the 100mg twice daily dosing constitutes the optimal schedule. It is re-iterated that mortality outcomes at month 24 by initial randomization pointed towards a higher effect of 200 mg bid versus placebo and 100 mg bid, noting however the caveat that the long term data are potentially biased as no randomization took place.</p><p>Also considering the recommendation obtained from the expert group, the CHMP concludes that, although the currently proposed dose schedule is acceptable within the context of conditional Marketing</p><p>Authorisation, a higher dose should be appropriately studied to better define optimal exposure-response relationship and impact on emergence of bacterial resistance, whilst taking account of the safety considerations, in particular the effect on QTc interval, expected with higher plasma exposure (and in context of combination with other potentially pro-arrhythmic therapeutic agents).</p><p>In consequence, to resolve the uncertainties around exposure and antimycobacterial activity, by conducting a further study exploring the relationship between different doses with respect to 2 months SCC and longer term outcome, the CHMP considers the following measure necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the context of a conditional MA:</p><p>"a post-authorization controlled study of the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of delamanid 100 mg twice daily for 2 months followed by delamanid 200 mg in a single daily dose for 4 months or delamanid 400 mg single daily dose for 6 months in adult patients with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis to be conducted, based on a CHMP-agreed protocol".</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefits</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Beneficial effects</head><p>During 8 weeks treatment with delamanid 100 mg or 200 mg twice daily in the Phase 2 study (242-07-204), a higher proportion of subjects with pulmonary tuberculosis caused by organisms that were at least resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid achieved sputum culture conversion (SCC) compared to the placebo group: in 45%, 42% and 30% in those treated with 100 mg bid, 200 mg bid and placebo, respectively; for patients with XDR-TB these figures were 4/24 (17%), 5/18 (28%) and 2/27 (7%).</p><p>As such, the magnitude of the difference vs. placebo in the MITT population varied by dose group, MDR-TB vs. XDR-TB, presence of cavitation, region and whether the analyses were based on MGIT or solid culture media results. It is noted that delamanid for ≥6 months (any combination of doses) yielded a sustained culture conversion in 91% of patients with MDR-TB (130/143), and in 78% (31/40) in those with XDR-TB.</p><p>Delamanid showed to be significantly active over the short term period and overall data point towards its incremental value as part of an optimal treatment regimen in MDR-TB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects</head><p>The comparison between delamanid and placebo was restricted to 8 weeks only. In addition, the data to Week 8 are clearly subject to influence according to region/site, at least part of which reflects the rates of XDR-TB.</p><p>The open-label data from 208/116 reflect patient decisions to continue with open-label treatment, investigator decisions to change the dose and willingness of patients to be followed up for final outcomes. Data from studies 208/116 do not address the essential deficiencies of study 204 and the available data cannot confirm the appropriateness of the applicant's proposed dose regimen for delamanid. However, data from literature and collaborative research data provides sufficient arguments that 2-month SCC be associated with better long term clinical outcome.</p><p>Whilst awaiting results from confirmatory trials, it can be considered, based on preliminary evidence, that the addition of delamanid to the armamentarium in an area of unmet medical need will be beneficial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risks</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unfavourable effects</head><p>The overall safety profile of delamanid is considered acceptable despite the fact that the size of the safety database is currently limited.</p><p>Delamanid is associated with prolongation of the QTc interval that is driven predominantly but not wholly by plasma levels of a major metabolite DM-6705. However, no torsades de pointes or any other major cardiac arrhythmia have been observed. Use with other medicinal products affecting QTc interval has been addressed in the SmPC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects</head><p>The total safety database, consisting of two delamanid dose groups and placebo in the first study and uncontrolled use of delamanid in the second study, is limited.</p><p>There are still missing data regarding interactions with transporters, which has important implications for potential drug-drug interactions.</p><p>The potential for delamanid to be associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity is uncertain and requires further characterisation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit-risk balance</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects</head><p>The efficacy in terms of sputum culture conversion of the two investigated doses (100 mg BID and 200 mg BID) was superior to placebo, but the duration of comparison was too short. The results of the follow-on studies are difficult to interpret. These data cannot address the essential deficiencies of study 204 and the available results cannot confirm the appropriateness of the applicant's proposed dose regimen for delamanid. However, recent data from literature and collaborative research data provide sufficient arguments that 2-month SCC obtained in trial 204 be correlated with better long term clinical outcome. Uncertainty remains on the most appropriate daily dosing schedule.</p><p>The main safety issue observed with delamanid relates to QT-prolongation, albeit no associated cases of ventricular tachycardia /torsades de pointes were observed. Further on, hepatotoxic potential cannot be dismissed. It is recommended that treatment be administered by directly observed therapy (DOT).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit risk balance</head><p>Further data are requested before the CHMP would consider whether those recommendations can be altered. CHMP is of the opinion that information from the planned post authorisation measures is essential to determine the full scope of safety and efficacy at chosen dosing regimen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion on the benefit-risk balance</head><p>MDR-TB is defined as TB caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin. It represents a significant unmet medical need in Europe and developing countries. MDR-TB is associated with a considerable mortality rate and poses a significant public health threat. New medicinal products that can be used in combination with existing therapies are therefore much needed. Delamanid, a nitro-dihydro-imidazo-oxazole derivative, provides a novel mechanism of action. It has been developed for clinical use against MDR strains of M. tuberculosis, as part of combination therapy.</p><p>Efficacy results (superiority outcome) were obtained in phase-2 pivotal trial 242-07-204. All patients were diagnosed for pulmonary, sputum culture positive MDR-TB and received an optimal background regimen (OBR). Patients were randomised into 3 groups and received 100 mg BID delamanid, 200 mg BID delamanid, or placebo, in combination with OBR (BID), and sputum culture status was assessed weekly; SCC was measured after 2 months of treatment. Unfortunately, study 242-07-208 does not allow for an assessment of SCC rates vs. placebo over the applicant's proposed 6 months duration of use. As such, the strength of the evidence of delamanid efficacy on long-term, is limited by the lack of a direct and sound proof of continuous benefit for at least 6 months, since study 208 is biased by the inadequate design. However, the value of 2 months SCC as important prognostic factor for longer term outcome has been proposed in several published analyses.</p><p>Re-examining all submitted data, and taking account of the position expressed by the expert group, the CHMP considers that notwithstanding the uncertainties and limitations of the data and further analyses, the limited evidence provided to date could be acceptable within the context of a conditional MA, subject to forthcoming confirmatory results from the phase 3 trial, necessary to address the missing longer term efficacy data.</p><p>In re-examining the submitted data, the CHMP confirmed that doubts remain if the 100mg twice daily dosing constitutes the optimal schedule. A total daily higher dose might be more appropriate, preferably within the context of once daily administration (which facilitates DOT practice). The CHMP concludes that, although the currently proposed dose schedule is acceptable within the context of conditional Marketing Authorisation, a higher dose (as once daily administration) should be appropriately explored to better define the optimal exposure-response and impact on emergence of bacterial resistance.</p><p>The adverse events profile for Delamanid has been established in a limited safety database, comprising approximately 900 individuals. Delamanid was generally well tolerated. However, potential hepatoxicity cannot be fully dismissed. The predominant concern regarding use of delamanid is the effect on QTc. Hypoalbuminaemia (particularly below 2.8 mg/dl) is identified as a major contributing factor.</p><p>Based on the totality of available data and the view expressed by the experts during the re-examination of delamanid MAA, the CHMP concludes that a positive benefit-risk balance of this medicinal product can be established, recommending the granting of a conditional marketing authorisation. This position takes into account that further confirmatory data will become available within a specified timeframe; that delamanid fulfils an unmet medical need and that the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of delamanid outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.</p><p>Assessment report EMA/55567/2014</p></div>

The applicant does not expect interactions to occur via interference with metabolism by albumin. Regarding interactions at the level of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes: -Delamanid did not induce human CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4/5 and mRNA levels in fresh primary cultures of hepatocytes at 0.1, 1 and 10 μmol/L. At 100 μmol/L there was little possibility for mechanism-based inhibition by delamanid on the CYP isoforms tested (CYP1A1/2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 [testosterone, midazolam]). -DM-6704 inhibited CYP2B6, CYP2C8/9 and CYP2C19 activities with IC50 values ranging from 25.2 to 89.4 μmol/L. -DM-6705 inhibited CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8/9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 (nifedipine oxidation) and CYP3A4 (testosterone 6β-hydroxylation) activities with IC50 values ranging from 18.3 to 87.5 μmol/L. -DM-6706 inhibited CYP2B6, CYP2C8/9, and CYP2C19 activities with IC50 values ranging from 32.8 to 90.6 μmol/L. -DM-6720 inhibited CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP3A4 (testosterone 6 β-hydroxylation) with IC50 values ranging from 10.9 to 42.3 μmol/L. -DM-6718 had little inhibitory potency against CYPs (IC50 &gt; 100 μmol/L).

None of the patients met biochemical criteria consistent with Hy's Law and none had isolated elevated bilirubin or a transaminase that was &gt; 3 x ULN. Briefly, these cases concerned:-A 31-year-old female on delamanid 100 mg BID had an ALT level &gt; 1 x ULN, an AST level &gt; 2 x ULN and a normal total bilirubin level (0.3 mg/dL). The abnormalities occurred at Week 26, were mild and were noted to have resolved at the follow-up visit (Day 225; but actual values not available). -A 41-year-old male on delamanid 200 mg BID had normal ALT, AST and bilirubin levels without any other evidence of abnormal hepatic function in the patient profile. On Day 45, not closely associated with any scheduled laboratory investigations, he was reported to have the TEAE of abnormal hepatic function possibly related to the study drug, which was considered mild and no change in study drug was made. The TEAE was said to have resolved 9-days later. The sponsor Assessment report EMA/55567/2014 does not know the basis of the TEAE report and it is not supported by any laboratory values in the database. -A 24-year-old male had mild elevations of transaminases (&gt; 1 x ULN) at Day 7 of 208, which was Day 84 of his participation in 204.

The largest meta-analysis of MDR-TB was conducted by the Collaborative Group for the WHO Stop TB Department using patient level data combined from different centers, using methods suggested by the Cochrane group (Stewart LA, Tierney JF, Clarke M on behalf of the Cochrane Individual Patient Data Metaanalysis Methods Group 2008. Reviews of individual patient data. Higgins JPT, Green S, editors. Cochrane Handbook for Systematic reviews of Intervention. Wiley-Blackwell; 48-58). An initial analysis of 9,153 patients with MDR-TB from 32 observational studies was published in 2012 (Ahuja SD et al. Multidrug Resistant Pulmonary Tuberculosis Treatment Regimens and Patient Outcomes: An Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis of 9,153 Patients. PLoS Med 2012;9(8):e1001300).To evaluate the validity of the 2-month SCC as a predictor of clinical outcome in MDR-TB, 2 co-authors (Richard White, PhD and Carole Mitnick ScD) undertook a series of analyses of a subset of 2,942 patients from the original total group (9,153 TB patients) for whom baseline culture data were available.The findings are described below and the resulting conclusions have been endorsed by the authors.Objectives:To evaluate the evidence that supports the utility and predictive value of sputum culture conversion (SCC) from growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to no growth after two months of intensive treatment (2-month SCC) as an endpoint in the context of MDR-TB, using individual sputum culture results that could be linked with long-term outcomes, such as mortality, assessment of treatment outcome at 24 months, using a WHO algorithm, by the PI of each cohort, assessment of treatment outcome at 24 months using a computer program implementation of the WHO algorithm, and with sustained SCC, from 2,492 patients included in the Collaborative Group for Meta-Analysis of Individual Patient Data in MDR-TB database.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_20"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>MDR-TB is a public health problem for which only limited treatment options are available. MDR-TB patients generally require treatment with a combination of at least 5-6 "second-line" anti-TB medications for up to 24 months. The current treatment success rate for MDR-TB patients is deemed inadequate, with a sizable proportion of patients dying, failing treatment or lost to follow-up. Hence, it has been recognised that new medicinal products are urgently needed, in order to improve overall outcome in MDR-TB patients. The development programme of delamanid aims to respond to this unmet medical need.Based on current evidence, the benefit-risk balance of Deltyba indicated for the treatment of pulmonaryinfections in adults due to multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis as part of an appropriate combination regimen (Deltyba is not recommended for use in the treatment of extra pulmonary tuberculosis [e.g. central nervous system, bone], latent infection with M. tuberculosis, drug-susceptible M. tuberculosis or infections due to Mycobacterial species other than those of the M. tuberculosis complex) could be deemed favourable for a limited indication only. It should be restricted for use as part of an appropriate combination regimen for pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in adult patients when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be composed for reasons of resistance or tolerability. This position takes into account the limited evidence of efficacy to support the proposed posology. The benefit/risk of using Delamanid is to be acceptable only under following strict conditions: -be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the management of multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis an appropriate combination regimen should continue after completion of the 24-week delamanid treatment period according to WHO guidelines serum albumin &lt; 2.8 mg/dL or taking medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A, constitute contra-indications.</figDesc></figure>

For example, against 24 M.tuberculosis MICs of delamanid determined using the agar proportion method ranged from ≤ 0.00625 to 0.0125 μg/mL regardless of whether strains were classified as drug-sensitive, MDR or XDR.The in-vitro activity of delamanid against 17 non-tuberculous Mycobacterium strains (all ATCC) determined by the agar (7H11) dilution method showed that: -Delamanid MIC against M. kansasii, M. shimoidei, M. xenopi and M. marinum was 0.024 μg/mL. -For M. avium, M. intracellulare, M. kansasii ATCC 12478, M. scrofulaceum, M. malmoense, M. simiae and M. ulcerans the MICs were in the range 0.5 -1.56 μg/mL -MICs were &gt; 100 μg/mL against M. smegmatis, M. aurum, M. szulgai, M. fortuitum and M. chelonae -Against M. africanum ATCC 25420 the MIC delamanid was comparable to M. tuberculosis. -For single strains of sub-species of the MTB-complex including M. pinnipedii (ATCC BAA-688), M. microti (ATCC19422 &amp; 11152), M. caprae (ATCC BAA-824) and M. bovis (ATCC BAA-935) the delamanid MICs were similar to those for M. tuberculosis.The MICs of the primary metabolites of delamanid (DM-6704, 6705 and 6706) against 10 M. tuberculosis strains, including some resistant to currently used anti-TB drugs, was determined using the agar dilution method. These metabolites showed poor activity with MICs that ranged from 6.25 to 50 μg/mL. For the other five metabolites (i.e. DM-6717, 6718, 6720, 6721 and 6722) all MICs were ≥ 12.5 μg/mL. Against a range of non-Mycobacterial species the MIC of delamanid was &gt; 100 μg/mL. MICs of DM-6704, DM-6705 and 6706 were 12.5 -&gt; 100 μg/mL, 6.25 to &gt; 100 μg/mL and 50 to &gt; 100 μg/mL, respectively.Delamanid showed no antagonistic activity with ethambutol, isoniazid, rifampicin and streptomycin.Combination with these agents was classified as synergistic or partially synergistic for 88.9%, 44.4%, 92.6% and 25.9%, respectively, of all tested strains.Against M. bovis BCG Tokyo under aerobic conditions and in liquid culture with incubation at 37°C delamanid showed bactericidal effects after 3 and 7 days at 0.016, 0.080 and 0.40 μg/mL but not at 0.0032 μg/mL. At 0.016 μg/mL delamanid gave a 3-log reduction in CFU on day 3 and a 4-log reduction in CFU on day 7.

Day 56 Cmax values were used to compute predictions for QTc change from baseline.The predicted placebo-adjusted ΔQTcF values were higher than the corresponding predicted placebo-adjusted ΔQTcB values. The highest placebo-adjusted ΔQTcF value was predicted for DM-6705Cmax. The PK/PD analysis for change in QTc from baseline (ΔQTcF and ΔQTcB) for delamanid, DM-6704, DM-6705 and DM-6720 indicated that the linear models for delamanid and DM-6704 overestimated the effect at high concentrations, while for DM-6705 and DM-6720 the regression lines went through the observed points. DM-6705 concentrations were identified as a surrogate marker for QTc prolongation since plasma levels predicted the highest change in QTcF at Cmax.

At each time point of the study, the median ΔQTcF was higher in patients on delamanid treatment who had a low albumin level at baseline. When the frequency of patients with ΔQTcF above 60 ms was stratified by albumin and ΔQTcF at each visit, it was also apparent that patients with low albumin who were treated with delamanid more often experienced pronounced QTc prolongation. Based on the performed sub-analysis, there seems to be a 6-to 8-fold higher risk for a patient with a baseline albumin level &lt;3.4 mg/dL to develop ΔQTcF exceeding 60 ms; the same elevation of the risk is seen if Day 56 albumin levels are used as the cut-off.Over time, the mean ΔQTcF observed in patients with a low baseline albumin level treated with delamanid ranges between 20 ms and 25 ms as compared to 15 ms to 20 ms in patients with albumin &gt;3.4 mg/dL. The underlying mechanism for the observed association between hypoalbuminaemia and QTc prolongation in patients treated with delamanid is not clearly understood; the fraction of unbound drug (or metabolite), the severity of the disease or other yet unknown factors may be contributing.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Assessment report</cell></row><row><cell>EMA/55567/2014</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

A potential initial exposure range was identified in the EBA trial seeking to optimize the bactericidal activity in the early stage of treatment. The bactericidal activity of delamanid was assessed through daily measurements of CFU counts in sputum and expressed as the slope of log CFU change per day over the 14 days of trial duration in EBA.

The appropriate dose to be used has not been defined and there are concerns that a higher daily dose might be necessary to achieve full efficacy. The currently proposed dose might therefore result in sub-optimal cure rates and encourage the development of microbiological resistance.</p><p>2. The data package submitted showed a treatment effect over just 2 months on sputum culture conversion and it has not been established that clinical efficacy would be maintained over the proposed 6 months treatment period.</p><p>Considering these uncertainties in life threatening conditions, the undersigned do not agree with the CHMP majority opinion. </p></div>			</div>
