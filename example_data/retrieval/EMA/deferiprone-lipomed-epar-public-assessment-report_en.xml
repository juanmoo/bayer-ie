<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Active substance</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General information</head><p>The chemical name of deferiprone is 3-hydroxy-1,2-dimethyl-4(1H)-pyridone corresponding to the molecular formula C 7 H 9 NO 2 . It has a relative molecular mass of 139.15 g/mol and structure as show in  The chemical structure of deferiprone was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis and spectroscopic methods including mass spectrometry (MS), ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV), infrared spectroscopy (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy investigations ( 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR). Deferiprone is a white crystalline powder, slightly sweet (caramel) odour. It is slightly soluble in cold water, soluble in hot water. It is a neither hygroscopic, nor chiral, compound. The active substance is micronised before being used in the manufacture of the finished product.</p><p>No information on polymorphic forms has been described in the literature. Analysis was performed on batches of deferiprone before and after micronisation. No difference or change in the polymorphic form could be observed either for batches after long term storage or after the micronisation process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacture, characterisation and process controls</head><p>Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the application dossier and in the restricted part of an ASMF and it was considered satisfactory.</p><p>The synthetic route of the active substance used is known from literature. Deferiprone is synthesized in one main step using commercially available well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications.</p><p>The commercial batch sizes of pure deferiprone have been defined. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.</p><p>The active substance is packaged, stored and shipped in LDPE bags which comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. The bags are placed inside a cardboard drum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specification</head><p>The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, UV), melting point (Ph.</p><p>Eur.), impurities (HPLC, GC), water content (Ph. Eur.), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), assay (titration), residual solvents (GC), particle size distribution (Ph. Eur.) and microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.).</p><p>Appropriate justification of the specification and limits was made according to the requirements of the general monograph of Ph.Eur. and relevant EU quality guidelines. Impurities present are controlled in line with ICH Q3A guideline.</p><p>The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for identity and impurities testing has been presented.</p><p>Batch analysis data for a sufficient number of batches) of the active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability</head><p>Stability data from 6 batches of active substance stored in the intended commercial package for up to 60 months under long term conditions (25 ÂºC / 60% RH), intermediate conditions (30 ÂºC / 65% RH) and accelerated conditions (40 ÂºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.</p><p>The following parameters were tested in the stability studies: appearance, assay, purity, impurities. All tested parameters were within the specifications.</p><p>Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Results of related substance (impurity) testing by HPLC on forced degradation samples under stress conditions were also provided on one batch. During the forced degradation studies, almost no appreciable changes were observed for thermal stress and photolytic degradation, although there was a brownish colouration of deferiprone. Deferiprone showed some degradation by acidic hydrolysis and to a lesser extent by basic hydrolysis.</p><p>The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest periods of 5 years in the proposed container with no special storage conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Finished medicinal product</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development</head><p>The finished product is presented as oval white to almost white film-coated tablets containing 500 mg of deferiprone as active substance.</p><p>All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this report.</p><p>The finished product is packed in blisters consisting of transparent, thermo-formable rigid PVC film, PVDC coated and aluminium foil with heat-sealing lacquer packed in a cardboard box. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.</p><p>Deferiprone is an oral iron chelating agent (ATC code: V03AC02). The intention of the pharmaceutical development of the medicinal product was to create an immediate release solid dosage form with the active substance deferiprone at a strength of 500 mg per tablet which is bioequivalent to the reference medicinal product, Ferriprox 500 mg film-coated tablets.</p><p>Deferiprone Lipomed and Ferriprox have the same qualitative composition in terms of excipients, apart from inclusion of croscarmellose sodium in the Deferiprone Lipomed formulation as an additional excipient. Comparative impurity profile data for Deferiprone Lipomed and Ferriprox has been provided.</p><p>The proposed commercial formulation of Deferiprone Lipomed is identical to that used in the bioequivalence study, apart from a slight reduction in the target amount of film-coating to make sure that that there are no differences between the actual formulation used for the bioequivalence study and the future commercial formulation.</p><p>The physicochemical property which is most relevant with regard to the in vivo performance of the finished product, is the particle size of the active substance. Appropriate acceptance limits have been established for the particle size distribution based on the experience gained during development and the batches used for the bioequivalence study.</p><p>During development, in vitro dissolution testing was performed in various media across the physiological pH range. An appropriate dissolution method was chosen for routine quality control (QC) testing of finished product. The discriminatory power of this dissolution method has been demonstrated.</p><p>A bioequivalence study was performed which demonstrated in vivo bioequivalence between the test product, Deferiprone Lipomed, and the reference product, Ferriprox. The clinical assessment of this bioequivalence study is discussed in section 2.4 of this report.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacture of the product and process controls</head><p>The manufacturing process consists of the following steps: preparation of granulation liquid, granulation of the active substance, preparation of compression mixture, compression, preparation of film-coating solution, preparation of film-coating suspension, film-coating, blistering, secondary packaging. Appropriate in-process controls are applied throughout the process. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Product specification</head><p>The finished product specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: visual appearance, dimensions, average mass, uniformity of mass (Ph. Eur.), identity of active substance (HPLC, UV), identity of colourant (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), impurities (HPLC), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.) and microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.).</p><p>The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.</p><p>Batch analysis results are provided for three commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability of the product</head><p>Stability data from three commercial scale batches of finished product stored for 12 months <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">(2 batches)</ref> and <ref type="formula">24</ref>  However, as some crucial specification parameters have not been tested in the stability specification of these historic batches, the data obtained from these studies can be treated as supportive only.</p><p>There were no out of specification results or trends observed for appearance, assay, impurities, hardness or dissolution results at any storage conditions. The test parameter loss on drying was out of specification in all three commercial batches after 6 months storage at accelerated conditions (40 ÂºC / 75% RH) and was out of specification in two batches after 12 months storage at intermediate conditions (30 ÂºC / 65% RH). It was concluded that this increase in loss on drying results is linked to the relative humidity (RH) of the storage conditions. The loss on drying result remained within specification at long term conditions (25 ÂºC / 60% RH) up to 12 months in all three primary stability batches (and at 24 months for one of the batches). The observed out of specification results on loss on drying do not likely pose any risk to product quality as there is no impact on any other specification parameters (i.e. dissolution or impurities) at the levels detected .Nevertheless, in the absence of any long term data relating to this parameter from the supportive studies, the approved final shelf-life and storage conditions are based on the available 12 months long term data from the three recent commercial batches.</p><p>Stability data for one batch of Deferiprone Lipomed 500 mg film-coated tablets stored as bulk (film-coated tablets prior to blistering) covering 6 months of storage at 25Â°C/60% RH and 40Â°C/75% RH Assessment report EMA/535221/2018 Page 10/26 are provided. The acceptable holding time for the bulk tablets prior to packaging is 6 months if stored in flat bags made of high density polyethylene at room temperature.</p><p>Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 12 months when stored below 25Â°C in the proposed blisters as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adventitious agents</head><p>No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4.">Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects</head><p>Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. Bioequivalence to the reference product, Ferriprox 500 mg film-coated tablets, has been demonstrated. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.5.">Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects</head><p>The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Non-clinical aspects</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Introduction</head><p>A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.</p><p>Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment</head><p>No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of Deferiprone Lipomed manufactured by Lipomed is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all Deferiprone containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Discussion on non-clinical aspects</head><p>The Applicant has presented a non-clinical discussion, including a description of impurities expected and their acceptability thresholds which is acceptable. The non-clinical data is reflected in the appropriate </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.4.">Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects</head><p>The non-clinical aspects are considered acceptable and support the approval of Deferiprone Lipomed 500 mg film-coated tablets.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.1.">Introduction</head><p>This is an application for film-coated tablets containing deferiprone. To support the marketing authorisation application the applicant conducted 1 bioequivalence study with cross-over design under fasting conditions. This study was the pivotal study for the assessment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GCP</head><p>The bioequivalence study was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. No other clinical trial reports have been submitted in support of this marketing authorisation application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exemption</head><p>This is a generic application for only one strength, hence a biowaiver is not applicable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical studies</head><p>To support the application, the applicant has submitted 1 bioequivalence study. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p>This was a single centre, open-label, randomised (order of treatments), balanced, 2-period, 2-sequence, single dose crossover trial with administration under fasting conditions to establish comparative bioequivalence of Deferiprone Lipomed 500 mg film-coated tablets and Ferriprox 500 mg film-coated tablets in 25 healthy, adult, male human subjects under fasting conditions (one subject No. 024 was randomised, but dropped out in period I before receiving at least one dosage of the study medication).</p><p>The objectives of the study were: a) to assess bioequivalence of test vs. reference products after single dose administration under fasting conditions, determined by use of AUC 0-tlast and C max obtained for deferiprone from plasma concentrations; b) to evaluate safety and tolerability of test and reference products considering adverse events observed in the study. One tablet of each product (test and reference) were administered. According to data from literature the elimination half-life of deferiprone had been determined as 2 to 3 hours. Thus, a wash out period of at least three treatment-free days between administrations was sufficient for complete elimination of the active ingredient of the previous administered investigational product from the body.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Test and reference products</head><p>The reference product Ferriprox is approved in the European Union. Samples originated from normal production batches. Prior to start of the clinical trial the Reference product was checked with respect to the relevant parameters of pharmaceutical quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Population(s) studied</head><p>Twenty-five (25) healthy male subjects, Caucasian, aged â‰¥ 18 years, were randomised. The mean age was 33 years, ranging from 21 to 54 years. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main inclusion criteria</head><p>Male subjects must fulfilled all the following criteria: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytical methods</head><p>Deferiprone in plasma samples was analysed by use of a validated method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Storage period of study samples</head><p>Blood samples for concentration measurements of deferiprone were collected in 7.5 ml tubes (Lithium heparinized tubes) from a vein using an indwelling cannula with switch valve or by direct venipuncture.</p><p>After blood collection lithium heparinized tubes were cooled immediately in an ice bath until centrifugation. The samples were centrifuged within 30 min (centrifugation conditions: 2000 x g, 10 min, 4Â°C) in order to separate formed elements. The supernatant plasma was divided into two parts and was transferred to two clean tubes and subsequently frozen at a temperature below -20Â°C. Time span between blood sampling and freezing of the samples should not have exceeded 60 min. Plasma was stored in frozen state at or below -20Â°C until time of analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bioanalytical report</head><p>The bioanalytical report was submitted. Analyses were performed by ACC GmbH Analytical Clinical</p><p>Concepts. The quantification of deferiprone in plasma was performed using a validated method.</p><p>Dosing started on 01.09.2016 and the bioanalysis was performed between 19.09.2016 to 29.09.2016</p><p>(two shipments -1) 14.09.2016; 2) 21.09.2016). Long term stability was determined for 43 days at below-20 0 C. This time span was sufficient as time between withdrawal of first PK sample and last analytical measurement did not exceed 15 days. 816 (for 24 subjects) samples were expected according to the protocol however 814 blood samples were received. There were 1.6 % haemolysed samples in the study (â‰¤ 1 % haemolysis). There were no lipaemic samples in the study.</p><p>According to the Analytical Study Protocol the study samples were to be stored at or below -20 Â°C at ACC GmbH. However, in the time span between receipt and measurement of the study samples the temperature increased above -20 Â°C for about 60 min with the highest temperature being -15.2 Â°C. As stability of deferiprone in plasma was proven for 6 hours at room temperature and for three thaw/freeze cycles during method validation, the above mentioned increase of the storage temperature did not affect the concentration of deferiprone in the study samples and has therefore no influence on the obtained study results.</p><p>In this study the total number of study samples measured was 814. In total 0.2 % of the samples were repeated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Incurred Sample Reanalysis</head><p>In this study, the scheduled total number of subject samples was 816. Incurred sample reanalysis was performed on 88 samples (10.8 %). As a criterion of acceptance two thirds of the repeat samples should agree within Â± 20 %. In total, 94.3 % of the repeat samples agreed within Â± 20 %. Therefore, the acceptance criteria were fulfilled and incurred sample reanalysis was in accordance with the European guideline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacokinetic variables</head><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived by means of non-compartmental analysis and were listed and evaluated descriptively (number of subjects (N), arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), geometric mean, geometric coefficient of variation (CV), median, minimum and maximum) separated by treatment.</p><p>Primary parameters: C max , AUC 0-tlast Secondary parameters: AUC 0-âˆž , AUC expol%, Clast, t max , t1/2, t last , Lz (= Î»), t lag of deferiprone.</p><p>Bioequivalence criteria: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was performed and used as basis for the calculation of 90 % confidence intervals; point estimates and confidence intervals for AUC-and C max -values and the comparison of Test vs. Reference were calculated by parametric analysis. AUC0-tlast and C max were considered as primary decision criteria for bioequivalence assessment. For parametric 90 % confidence intervals, acceptance limits of 80.00 % -125.00 % for AUC 0-tlast and C max were applied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical methods</head><p>The statistical analyses were performed as a valid case analysis including all subjects of the per-protocol set (no subgroup analysis was planned). Descriptive statistics (N, arithmetic means, SD, geometric means, geometric CV, medians, minimum, and maximum) were presented for all pharmacokinetic parameters. The statistical analyses were carried out on the basis of a multiplicative model for all AUC-   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety data</head><p>Twenty-four subjects received at least 1 tablet of Test or Reference. One subject No. 024 was randomised, but was excluded from the study before receiving at least one dosage of the study medication. In the remaining subjects drug exposure was in accordance with the protocol. Twenty-four subjects received 1 tablet of Test and Reference each. Therefore, drug exposure was 1 x 500 mg of deferiprone in each period. Hence, total dose of each subject was 2 x 500 mg resulting in 1000 mg deferiprone in total.</p><p>After study drug intake, 5 subjects showed 7 AEs (according to their MedDRA coded preferred term (PT)</p><p>grouped by system organ class (SOC), intensity and relationship to IMPs); 5 after Test treatment and 2 after Reference treatment.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.5.">Discussion on clinical aspects</head><p>Deferiprone monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of iron overload in patients with thalassaemia major when current chelation therapy is contraindicated or inadequate. Deferiprone is furthermore indicated in combination with another chelator in patients with thalassaemia major when monotherapy with any iron chelator is ineffective, or when prevention or treatment of life-threatening consequences of iron overload justifies rapid or intensive correction.</p><p>To support the application, the Applicant has submitted one bioequivalence study (BE). The BE has been performed using the originator; the test product (Deferiprone Lipomed 500 mg film-coated tablets) and the reference product (Ferriprox 500 mg film coated tablets). The reference product Ferriprox is approved in the European Union (MA Holder: Apotex Europe B.V., MA number: EU/1/99/108/001). The study has been performed under fasting conditions. According to the reference product SmPC recommendation (Ferriprox, SmPC), the drug should be taken on an empty stomach.</p><p>According to literature data obtained earlier, mean maximum serum concentrations of approximately 32.4 (Â± 13.2) Î¼g/ml were expected after a dose of 1500 mg deferiprone in Thai healthy volunteers. The analytical method planned for this clinical trial was intended to allow a LLOQ of 0.20 Î¼g/ml for deferiprone. Therefore, deferiprone at dose 500 mg was chosen to achieve sufficient plasma levels to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile.</p><p>The methodology related to sample size calculation and statistical evaluation of bioequivalence of two products was clearly presented and properly discussed. Parameters chosen for sample size calculations were appropriate and in line with the requirements of the guidelines. AUC 0-tlast and C max were considered as primary decision criteria for bioequivalence assessment. Statistical analyses in presented study were designed and conducted according to assumptions and recommendations for bioequivalence studies. The SAP often referred to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence. The methodology related to ANOVA modelling and two one-sided test (TOST) was clearly presented and properly discussed.</p><p>Moreover, submitted dossier was implemented with widely described data management procedures and data assurance procedures. Presented protocol included list of software to be used to results analyses.</p><p>The subjects were randomly assigned to one of the 2 possible treatment sequences according to Latin square. Blood samples were taken at the following time points: pre-dose samples: within 1.5 h prior to dosing; post-dose samples: 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, 40 min, 50 min, 1 h, 1 h 20 min, 1 h 40 min, 2 h, 2 h 30 min, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 7 h and 8 h p.a. The sampling periods are acceptable with sample time points around t max for deferiprone and with an adequate wash-out period (at least 3 treatment free days) at greater than five times the t 1/2 (2-3 hours for deferiprone). The sampling frequency enabled an adequate Assessment report EMA/535221/2018 Page 19/26 estimation of C max . The sampling schedule covered the plasma concentration time curve long enough to provide a reliable estimate of the extent of exposure.</p><p>Certificates of analysis for both the test and reference products have been provided. Assay values of 99.5% (497.5 mg) and 100.24% (501.2 mg) for the test and reference are reported respectively. The assayed content of the batch used as test product did not differ more than 5% from that of the batch used as reference product. The batch size and manufacturing date of the test product have been declared and are acceptable.</p><p>Data from literature showed gender-related differences with higher AUC and lower clearance-values in females. Inter-individual variability of C max seemed to be higher in females.</p><p>Furthermore, as females often suffer from menstruation related iron deficiency anaemia which might worsen after intake of study medication and due to the clastogenic and teratogenic properties of the deferiprone, females were not intended to participate for safety reasons, too. Thus, only male subjects participated in the study. Twenty-five healthy male subjects, Caucasian, aged â‰¥ 18 years, were randomised. The mean age was 33 years, ranging from 21 to 54 years. Total number of subjects (planned and analysed): 24 intended to be randomised, 35 enrolled, 25 randomised, 1 drop out, 25 full analysis set, 23 per protocol set.</p><p>The inclusion and exclusion criteria are acceptable and performed according to the protocol. All subjects are observed and treated according to the same rules. The data from all treated subjects was treated equally. The population studied is appropriate and the main inclusion and exclusion criteria are in line with the requirements of the Guideline on the investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 01). It appeared that 20 subjects would be sufficient to demonstrate the bioequivalence of Deferiprone and Ferriprox. However, bearing in mind that intra-individual variability of AUC and C max was established in the study with Asian people, a bigger sample size has been was chosen (n=24). That approach is accepted. 23 subjects completed the study.</p><p>The analytical method for the determination of deferiprone in human plasma seems to be described adequately; the validations were performed according to the requirements of the EMA "Guideline on Primary parameters: C max , AUC 0-tlast . Secondary parameters: AUC 0-âˆž , AUC expol% , C last , t max , t 1/2 , t last , Lz (= Î»), t lag of deferiprone. These parameters were estimated to evaluate bioavailability. A total of 25 subjects were evaluated for safety. One subject was randomized, but dropped out in period I before receiving at least one dosage of the study medication. A total of 24 subjects were exposed to the IMPs. Both products were found to be safe and well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events (AEs)</p><p>reported in this study. The adverse event was not life threatening or required the subjects to be hospitalized.</p><p>After study drug intake, 5 subjects showed 7 AEs -5 after Test treatment and 2 after Reference treatment.</p><p>The most frequent AE, which was reported after study drug intake was headache (4 cases).

Decision in favor of bioequivalence was accepted when the parametric 90 % confidence intervals did not exceed the limits of 80.00 and 125.00% for the ratio of primary target variables. The decision procedure based on 90 % confidence intervals corresponded to two one-sided tests with an error probability Î±= 0.05.Also submitted study had data quality assurance procedures established. Methods of detecting outliers, corrections of data and missing data handling were established in protocol. This included all activities undertaken during and after the clinical trial to verify and control quality. It embraced internal quality control by the staff itself and by independent second persons as well as monitoring and separate auditing activities. All activities were performed according to written procedures of the MAH and the facilities involved.Maximum exposure, represented by geometric mean C max -values, was quite similar for both products with 7020.22 ng/ml for Test and 7153.44 ng/ml for Reference.

Two cases of headache occurred in Test-treated subjects and two cases of headache occurred in Reference-treated subjects. All cases were of mild intensity. With regard to the occurrence of headache, there is no difference between Test treatment and Reference treatment.One case of vision blurred of mild intensity occurred in a Test-treated subject while no case of vision blurred occurred in a Reference-treated subject. This case of vision blurred was classified as not related to study medication. Due to this classification of relationship and given the very low number of one case only, it is not considered that this could represent an actual difference between Test treatment and Reference treatment.One case of diarrhoea of mild intensity occurred in a Test-treated subject while no case of diarrhoea occurred in a Reference-treated subject. Given the very low number of one case only, it is not considered that this could represent an actual difference between Test treatment and Reference treatment.
