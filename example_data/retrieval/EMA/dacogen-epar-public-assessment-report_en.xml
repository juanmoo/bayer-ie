<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Background information on the procedure</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Submission of the dossier</head><p>The applicant Janssen-Cilag International N V submitted on 31 May 2011 an application for Marketing</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacture</head><p>The chemical synthesis of decitabine essentially comprises of three steps using well-defined starting materials and including a purification step. The narrative of the synthesis provided was considered sufficiently detailed; yields and quantities of materials and operating conditions were indicated.</p><p>A summary of specifications for all reagents, solvents and processing agents was provided; and it was acceptable. All residual solvents and catalysts are controlled within ICH specifications Control of critical steps and intermediates were well detailed.</p><p>Validation was performed on 3 consecutive, full-scale batches of the active substance. Analytical results were consistent and met the proposed control limits.</p><p>The development of the synthesis route was well explained. The impurity profile showed that no impurities above the ICH qualification level of 0.15% could be observed.</p><p>The chemical structure and absolute configuration of decitabine has been confirmed by spectroscopy (IR, UV, 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR), high resolution mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, optical rotation and single crystal x-ray crystallography. Physical characterisation was performed using powder X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, thermo-gravimetric analysis, dynamic vapour sorption, hot stage microscopy and infrared spectroscopy. The established structure is shown to be consistent with the analytical and spectroscopic data and is stated to comply with that obtained from published literature. The control limits for specific optical rotation are accepted as adequate to assure stereoisomeric purity on a routine basis.</p><p>Polymorphism was controlled during the manufacturing process and since the product is reconstituted as a solution and diluted before administration the polymorphic form is not considered as a critical attribute for the active substance.</p><p>An extensive and satisfactory discussion was presented on the impurities including the potential genotoxic impurities. The active substance itself, a structural analogue of the DNA building block, 2′deoxycytidine, has been shown to be genotoxic. Structure-based assessment (DEREK) has been used to identify potential genotoxins among the starting materials, intermediates, reagents, and impurities of the active substance. Given the nature of the active substance, this assessment focused on unique alert structures, unrelated to the structure of the active substance. Those structures which triggered an alert owing to the nucleoside structure shared with the parent molecule were considered to be qualified by decitabine itself. This approach is accepted and the impurities were found below toxicological qualification limits. The tresholds were in line with the ICH Q3A guideline.</p><p>For the residual solvents, the proposed limits meet or are more stringent than those recommended by ICH Q3C guidance. A suitable GC method has been developed and validated to monitor residual solvent content. The batch analyses were in compliance with the limits of the ICH Q3C guideline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specification</head><p>Appropriate specification applied to the active substance included: appearance (visual), identification (IR and HPLC), clarity of solution (Ph.Eur. ), specific rotation (Ph. Eur.), assay of decitabine (HPLC), chromatographic purity (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (Ph.Eur. 2.5.32), residue on ignition (Ph.Eur. 2.4.14), particle size (laser diffraction), heavy metals (USP, harmonised with Ph.Eur.), microbiological quality (Ph.Eur. 2.6.12 and Ph.Eur. 2.6.13) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph.Eur. 2.6.14).</p><p>The Analytical methods used have been adequately described and the in-house methods have been adequately validated.</p><p>Batch analysis of 4 batches reflecting a variety of sources, process scales and synthetic routes were presented and all data complied with the proposed specification.</p><p>The specification for the active substance are adequately justified and set according to ICH guidelines and Ph. Eur. requirements. The container closure system consists of double polyethylene bags placed within an opaque, HDPE drum. Silica gel is used as a desiccant. The primary packaging conforms with the requirements of EU Directive 2002/72/EC. A suitable specification has been provided along with the IR spectrum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability</head><p>Stability studies were conducted on three commercial batches of decitabine under ICH conditions: at 30 o C/65%RH (up to 18 month data) and at 40 o C/75%RH (6 months data).</p><p>The selected stability parameters comprise appearance and clarity of solution, water content, specific rotation, assay and related substances. Polymorphism does not affect the final product therefore this parameter was not assessed during stability Under all storage conditions, minor variability but no significant changes were observed for any parameter and the substance complied with the proposed specifications.</p><p>In addition, a photostability study was performed in line with ICH recommendations for exposure to UV and visible light. All test parameters above, supplemented by tests for microbial purity and bacterial endotoxins satisfactorily demonstrated the photostability of decitabine after 4 weeks of ICH recommended light exposure. Forced degradation studies (acidic, basic, oxidation, and high temperature) were conducted on one batch of decitabine (solid state and solution). The results showed that decitabine was stable under oxidation and high temperature but was unstable under alkaline conditions.</p><p>Based on these data, the proposed re-test period was accepted, when packaged in the proposed container and under no special temperature storage conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Finished Medicinal Product</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmaceutical Development</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Components of the Drug Product</head><p>Decitabine is a white to almost white powder. Solubility and particle size were discussed, and although particle size was not critical for the solubility it was controlled to ensure good manufacturability. Once processed, the lyophilized product is reconstituted with water for injection and further diluted for infusion, at which point active substance particle size is not relevant. Polymorphism is well controlled during the manufacturing process.</p><p>The finished product is formulated with compendial and commonly used pharmaceutical excipients. The function of each excipient was well described. Excipients used were mainly for pH adjusting and buffering agents. Nitrogen is a processing aid used during the lyophilization process to provide an inert atmosphere for reducing moisture content. Stability data for the drug product were considered acceptable to demonstrate the absence of incompatibility between the active substance and the excipients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formulation Development</head><p>Since decitabine is heat sensitive and prone to hydrolysis in aqueous solution, it was justified to use a lyophilised powder for reconstitution at the time of use. To optimise stability in aqueous solution, critical parameters such as the pH and temperature were controlled.</p><p>The parenteral route of administration was preferred due to its maximum bioavailability, decitabine being degraded in the GI tract.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overages</head><p>No overages are applied to this product.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Physicochemical and Biological Properties</head><p>This section addressed the key physicochemical attributes related to drug product performance. Since</p><p>Decitabine is hygroscopic and degrades in aqueous solutions, minimizing the moisture content of the finished product by lyophilization ensures a stable product. The amount of time in aqueous solution during the compounding, filling, and lyophilization of the finished product was also carefully controlled to minimize the rate of degradation. The selected container/closure system provided an adequate moisture barrier as demonstrated by long-term stability data. The pH of the aqueous solution and the duration in solution during the compounding, filling, and lyophilization of the finished product were carefully controlled to minimise the rate of degradation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacturing Process Development</head><p>The heat sensitivity of decitabine in aqueous solution was acknowledged from in-use stability data.</p><p>Thus, the use of aseptic filtration as a means of sterilisation is accepted without additional confirmation. Process development, including minor changes implemented on moving from pilot scale for Phase I clinical and registration lots to the current production scale were outlined and acceptable.</p><p>Justification of critical process parameters such as mixing time, pH, temperature, and sterile filtration was provided.</p><p>The bulk solution holding time was well established as it is critical to minimise degradation.</p><p>Development and optimisation of the lyophilisation cycle was adequately described. The pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains Quality by design (QbD) elements.</p><p>For each unit operation, a summary of the studies conducted at development, pilot and/or commercial scale was presented. The lyophilization cycle parameters have been optimized and well characterized during the development and scale-up studies. The information provided was satisfactory.</p><p>The proposed proven acceptable ranges for process parameters are typical operating ranges were considered acceptable. The pH of the aqueous solution and the duration of the active substance in solution during the compounding, filling, and lyophilization of the finished product were carefully controlled to minimise the rate of degradation</p><p>The rationale for the critical parameters identified such as pH was satisfactorily provided.</p><p>All clinical batches have been manufactured at industrial scale according to the commercial formulation. All of them used active substance from a previous supplier including pivotal phase 3 study (DACO-016) batches. Taking into account that particle size distribution and impurity profile have been compared and found similar between the two decitabine sources (current applied manufacturer and previous manufacturer for the clinical batches) on a significant number of batches, and that confirmation batches have demonstrated that the commercial manufacturing process leads to finished product with the same satisfactory characteristics, clinical batches are thus considered representative of the proposed commercial product.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Container Closure System</head><p>The proposed container closure system (glass vial with elastomer stopper / aluminium crimp seal) was typical for lyophilised parenteral products and conform to Ph. Eur. type I standards including closure integrity. The compatibility of the packaging with drug product was demonstrated by the stability data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Microbiological Attributes</head><p>The manufacturing process including sterile filtration of the bulk solution and aseptic processing, has been correctly validated. Sterility and bacterial endotoxins testing were included in the release and shelf life specifications ensuring the compliance of the finished product with compendial requirements.</p><p>The integrity of all container closure systems has been demonstrated by maintenance of sterility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Compatibility</head><p>The finished product is reconstituted with Water for Injections prior to further dilution with infusion fluid.</p><p>Decitabine undergoes hydrolytic degradation in aqueous solutions. Compatibility stability studies were performed: in-use stability of the reconstituted and diluted solution and stability of diluted solution delivered through infusion sets, both at room temperature and refrigerated conditions. Data confirmed the compatibility and the stability for the reconstituted solution and the diluted infusions as described in the SmPC. Specifications were well justified and the limits applied to specified impurities were below the qualified levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytical Procedures</head><p>The general methodology of the Ph. Eur. was referenced for identification by UV, clarity of solution, visible and sub-visible particles, pH, uniformity of dosage units (by mass variation), sterility and bacterial endotoxins.</p><p>In-house methods are described for appearance, identification by HPLC retention time, reconstitution time, assay, related substances and water content by Karl Fischer.</p><p>Validation of the in-house analytical methods has been adequately performed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Batch Analyses</head><p>Batch analysis data were presented for five production-scale batches. These were supplemented by four registration / validation lots and six clinical lots. Additional data generated at a smaller batch scale were also presented. All data were satisfactory and in compliance with the proposed specifications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability of the product</head><p>Stability studies were conducted on six batches (pilot and production-scale) of the finished product packed in the commercial packaging under ICH conditions: 2-8 °C (1 batch for 24 months), 25 °C / 60% RH (7 batches up to 36months), 30 °C / 75% RH (1 batch for 24 months), 40 °C / 75% RH (6 batches for 6 months). The active substance was obtained from the different manufacturers used.</p><p>The tests performed were: appearance, reconstitution of solution (time, clarity, visible particles), assay, related substances, pH, water, closure integrity, sterility, and bacterial endotoxins. The analytical methods were stability indicating and were the same as those used for the release product testing.</p><p>Over the stability period, product appearance, visible particles and clarity of reconstituted solution continued to meet specification.</p><p>Under the long term conditions, no significant change could be observed in the test parameters, and under higher temperature the results remained also within the specification.</p><p>Photostability data generated in line with ICH guidance were provided for a single lot in primary packaging and confirm the photostability of the active substance.</p><p>Overall, the data support the proposed shelf-life and the storage conditions as proposed in the SmPC. product quality product characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.5.">Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects</head><p>The quality of Dacogen is satisfactory when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled appropriately. Data has also been presented regarding TSE and no concern was identified.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Introduction</head><p>Decitabine belongs to the deoxycytidine analogues. It is a prodrug that requires metabolic activation by deoxycytidine kinase. Indeed, prior to the incorporation of decitabine into the DNA, the drug has to be phosphorylated by several kinases. Decitabine triphosphate is the active moiety which is incorporated into DNA.</p><p>Decitabine produces antitumor effects by specifically targeting DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) that maintain the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes and contribute to the progression of cancers. Decitabine, a cytidine deoxynucleoside analogue, is specifically incorporated into DNA leading to the covalent trapping of DNMTs in a complex with the decitabine substituted DNA. This depletes the DNMT activity in cells, leading to DNA hypomethylation in gene promotor regions. This results in reexpression of silenced genes that can inhibit cellular proliferation, induce differentiation or induce apoptosis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Leukemia models</head><p>The in vitro activity of decitabine was measured in several human and murine models (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 1</ref>). Decitabine was also shown to induce morphological and functional differentiation in leukemia cell lines (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 2</ref>). In the OCI-AML2 and KG1 human AML cell lines decitabine had antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects. A dose-and time-dependent inhibition of proliferation was observed following single pulse treatments with 1.0 and 5.0 μM. Analysis of DNA fragmentation indicated significant pro-apoptotic effects <ref type="bibr">(Schmelz, 2005b)</ref>.</p><p>In vitro, it seems that high doses of decitabine induce cytotoxicity while low doses induce hypomethylation. Indeed, it was demonstrated that the dose-dependant curve representing methylation due to decitabine treatment has a U-shape. It appears that at concentrations higher than 0.5 or 1.0 µM, methylation increases <ref type="bibr">(Qin, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Qin 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, in the human lymphoid CCRF/CEM/0 line, decitabine decreased the methylation level to 47% of baseline at 0.3 µM, while the IC50 for cell survival attained 1 µM, suggesting a gap between the hypomethylating doses and the cytotoxic doses <ref type="bibr">(Antonsson, 1987)</ref>.</p><p>•</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Solid tumor</head><p>The activity of decitabine was assessed in different solid tumor models (breast, colon, prostate cancer).</p><p>IC50 values varied from nM to the µM range <ref type="bibr">(Qin, 2009</ref>).</p><p>In HT-29 human colon cancer cells, the concentration of 1 µM of decitabine produced a 90% inhibition of methylation without causing cell lethality <ref type="bibr">(Glazer, 1984)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decitabine resistance</head><p>Phosphorylation by deoxycytidine kinase represents the initial step to decitabine activation prior to incorporation into DNA. Complete loss or reduction of deoxycytidine kinase activity results in resistance to decitabine <ref type="bibr">(Vesely, 1970)</ref>.</p><p>Uridine kinase activity was also reduced in decitabine resistant tumors (a 10% decrease) but the decrease was more important in 5-azacytidine resistant tumors (decrease of 74%). The deletion of both kinases could explain cross-resistance of 5-azacytidine-resistant leukemic cells to decitabine <ref type="bibr">(Vesely, 1970)</ref>. Deamination of decitabine by cytidine deaminase may also play a role in mediating lack of response to decitabine. Cytidine deaminase is a key enzyme in the metabolism of cytosine nucleoside analogues since their deamination is a major pathway of pharmacokinetic disposition of these agents resulting in a complete loss of antileukemic activity. It has been shown that treatment with decitabine is associated with an increase in cytidine deaminase activity in decitabine-resistant HL-60 cells and in leukemic cells of some decitabine-treated patients <ref type="bibr">(Momparler, 1990)</ref>. Additionally, the intracellular phosphorylated decitabine intermediates may also be deaminated by deoxycytidylate deaminase <ref type="bibr">(Momparler, 1984a)</ref>.</p><p>In order to evaluate the interaction of decitabine with the P-glycoprotein efflux pump, bi-directional permeability of decitabine through MDR1 transfected MDCK cell monolayers was studied. Results from these in vitro experiments indicated that decitabine is a poor P-gp substrate and therefore is not susceptible to multi-drug resistance mediated by P-gp.</p><p>In a panel of cancer cell lines, it was demonstrated that sensitivity to decitabine showed a low correlation to that of 5-azacytidine (AZA), but a good correlation to that of cytarabine. The most resistant cell lines to decitabine had a combination of low deoxycytidine kinase, hENT1 and hENT2 nucleoside transporters and high cytosine deaminase <ref type="bibr">(Qin, 2009</ref>). However, the in vitro drug sensitivity does not always correlate with drug resistance in patient <ref type="bibr">(Momparler, 1985c)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In vivo studies</head><p>The antitumor activity of decitabine alone or in combination has been studied in several leukaemia models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-comparative studies</head><p>Decitabine anti-tumor activity was tested in several mouse leukaemia models (AKR, P388, L1210) (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 3</ref>).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparative studies</head><p>Studies were performed to compare the activity of decitabine with cytarabine and azacytosine in mouse leukaemia L1210. When mice were treated with increasing doses of each agent up to a maximal tolerated dose, decitabine was the most effective compound. Decitabine was the only drug that allowed all the treated animals to survive more than 60 days (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 4</ref>) <ref type="bibr">(Momparler, 1984b)</ref>. In the Brown Norway rat leukemia model, decitabine activity was compared with cytarabine. At the maximum dose of decitabine (250 mg/kg) and cytarabine (1000 mg/kg) tested, decitabine induced a 10-day longer survival time than cytarabine which means 2 logs more of leukemic cell kill for decitabine <ref type="bibr">(Richel, 1988)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Combination studies</head><p>•</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Combination studies with Histone Deacetylase</head><p>Histone acetylation has been shown to work in concert with methylation to regulate gene transcription.</p><p>Acetylation of histone is required to maintain chromatin in an open and transcriptionnally active state.</p><p>This permits binding of transcriptional factors, histone acetylases and other regulatory co-activators that promote gene expression. Conversely, histone deacetylases (HDAC) act to keep these residues deacetylated and thus maintain transcriptional silencing. Also, binding of HDAC to hypermethylated chromatin, under DNMTs direction produces a DNA binding complex capable of blocking the access of the transcriptional activators to promoters. It should be noted that methylation is dominant to histone deacetylation, so transcription cannot occur without first inhibiting methylation. Initial treatment with DNMT inhibitors followed by HDAC inhibitors can produce additive or synergistic effects for reexpression of transcriptionnally silenced genes <ref type="bibr">(Baylin, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>In in vitro studies, a synergistic induction of apoptosis was observed when the pan-HDAC inhibitor JNJ-26481585 (12.5 to 250 nM) was combined with decitabine (1 μM) pretreatment in several leukemic cell lines (U937,HL60, THP1 and MOLT4). In U937 and THP1 cells, significant induction of H3 acetylation was observed after pre-treatment with decitabine followed by JNJ-26481585, compared with single agent <ref type="bibr">JNJ-26481585 (Tong, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>The in vitro treatment of decitabine and phenylbutyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, in combination produced a greater inhibition of growth, DNA synthesis and a greater reduction on colony formation on both L1210 and human HL-60 leukemic cells as compared to either drug alone. The combination also produced a synergistic activation of the tumor suppressor gene p15CDN2B in the L1210 cells. In mice with L1210 leukemia, the combination showed enhanced antineoplastic activity <ref type="bibr">(Lemaire, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>The activity of the combination of decitabine and the HDAC inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) was studied in two different leukemia cell lines: HL-60 and MOLT4. When combined, decitabine and VPA had an additive effect on leukemia cell kill and apoptosis, as well as on the reactivation of p57KIP2 and p21CIP1 <ref type="bibr">(Yang, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>The combination of decitabine with trichostatin or depsipeptide FR901228, two potent inhibitors of histone deacetylase, produced a greater inhibition of growth and DNA synthesis and a greater loss of clonogenicity than either agent alone in HL60 and KG1a leukaemia cell lines <ref type="bibr">(Shaker, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>• Combination with antimetabolites and drugs used to treat leukaemia Cytarabine is the most active agent in myeloid leukemia. Their combination was studied in different human leukemia cell lines. The combination of decitabine and ara-C showed additive induction of cell death in ML-1 and synergistic induction in HL60, Raji, and Jurkat. Sequentially, decitabine followed by cytarabine was a synergistic combination in all cell lines. But antagonism was observed in terms of epigenetic effects (cytarabine reduced the effects of decitabine on hypometylation and gene reexpression). However, it is likely that the antagonism is apparent but not real and reflects killing of the most hypomethylated cells <ref type="bibr">(Qin, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>In vivo, cytarabine given simultaneously with decitabine to L1210 leukemic mice strongly reduces decitabine activity against L1210 leukemia (T/C was 267% and 156% for a single treatment on Day 3 and 311% and 211% for a 3-time treatment on Day 3, 6 and 9 for decitabine and the combination decitabine+cytarabine respectively). This can be explained by the fact that cytarabine prevents decitabine incorporation into DNA <ref type="bibr">(Colombo, 1986)</ref>.</p><p>The combined effects of decitabine and hydroxyurea, a ribonuclease reductase inhibitor used in the treatment of leukemias and sickle-cell disease, were tested in HL-60 and T24 cell lines in vitro. The concomitant treatment of hydroxyurea with decitabine resulted in a reduction of the inhibition of DNA methylation induced by decitabine. The reduction in decitabine efficacy was attributed to the arrest of the cell cycle induced by hydroxyurea. By contrast, sequential exposure to the two drugs produced a synergistic effect <ref type="bibr">(Choi, 2007)</ref>.</p></div>

It was about 100-fold less active (as shown by the increased life span) in L1210 leukemic mice after a single i.p. administration and 100-less toxic after daily i.p. administration for 1 week in mice <ref type="bibr">(Vesely, 1984)</ref>.</p><p>In human lymphoblastoid CCRF-CEM cells, the α-anomer induced hypomethylation of specific DNA loci at concentrations comparable to decitabine while cytotoxicity of the α-anomer was seen at 4-fold higher concentrations compared to decitabine (IC50 = 2.4 and 0.6 µM, respectively). Since α-anomers of nucleosides are generally not incorporated into DNA, it is possible that the α-anomer activity is due to its conversion into the ß-anomer (decitabine) <ref type="bibr">(Fojtova, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Exposure to the α-anomer induced the down-regulation of hTERT gene expression at lower concentrations than decitabine that was more cytotoxic <ref type="bibr">(Hajek, 2008)</ref>. (0.9% NaCl) and decitabine treated animals, in comparison with baseline values, was slightly greater and variable in decitabine dosed animals, but did not result in a statistically significant difference in heart rate at any time point between the vehicle and decitabine groups and is therefore considered of no relevance. Decitabine plasma exposure, based on a separate single dose i.v. 1-h infusion monkey study at the same dose level indicated that the exposure in monkeys was 20 to 30-fold higher than the clinical exposure.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Absorption</head><p>After an i.v. single administration, decitabine plasma levels declined bi-exponentially in every tested species, with a fast initial decline (few minutes) and a somewhat longer elimination half-life (23 minutes in mice, 44 minutes in rabbits, 1 hour in monkey, 69 to 144 minutes in dogs and 3 hours in rats). This species difference in the elimination of decitabine was also found in the clearance values.</p><p>The clearance of decitabine was highest in the monkey, followed by the mouse and the rabbit and then the dog and the rat. This species difference is consistent with the species differences in the activity of cytidine deaminase, the main metabolizing enzyme of decitabine.</p><p>Decitabine showed a low to moderate oral bioavailability.

The main inactivation pathway is mediated by cytidine deaminase that has a 20 times higher affinity to its natural substrates than to decitabine. Its degradation is also mediated dCMP deaminase that transforms decitabine monophosphate to 5-aza-dUMP. Cytochrome P450-mediated degradation is minor.</p><p>The phosphorylation of decitabine is essential before its incorporation into DNA.

Of significance, 73% of the mutations induced by decitabine occurred at CpG sites implicating demethylation as a factor in mutagenesis (Jackson-Grusby, 1997).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Carcinogenicity</head><p>No conventional carcinogenicity studies were conducted.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.5.">Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment</head><p>In vivo, decitabine showed a strong activity in murine leukemia models (AKR, P388 and L1210). It increased the survival of treated animals. This activity was dose-dependant up to a certain dose after which a plateau is reached or survival even decreases. The same relationship was observed in a rat myeloid leukemia model.</p><p>The effects of the combination of decitabine with other anticancer drugs were studied. These studies showed the importance of sequencing when considering combination treatment with decitabine.</p><p>Several potential mechanisms of resistance to decitabine have been investigated in vitro (decrease of deoxycytidine kinase activity, increase of dCTP pool, increase of cytidine deaminase activity, low levels of decitabine transporter hENT) but no cleat-cut resistance pattern has been established in clinical studies.</p><p>Regarding secondary pharmacodynamics, decitabine showed activity in sickle cell disease treatment by allowing re-expression of HbF gene. It was able to induce cell growth without and differentiation in normal hematopoietic cells. In vitro, the α-anomer showed activity and less cytotoxicity than decitabine.</p><p>Regarding Pharmacokinetics of decitabine was studied in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys. The profile was roughly the same in every species.</p><p>After a single administration of decitabine, the main toxic effects were observed on the hematopoietic system (bone marrow hypoplasia and thymus atrophy in mice, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia and erythropenia, atrophy of lymphoid tissue and hypocellularity of bone marrow in dogs, decreased leucocytes count in monkeys). In mice, mortality was observed around 20 mg/kg after i.v. infusion and at 75 mg/kg after i.v. bolus. Deaths occurred at 5 mg/kg in dogs whereas no mortality was observed in monkeys up to 52.4 mg/kg.</p><p>In repeat-dose toxicity studies, Decitabine was tested in mice up to once daily for 4 weeks, in rats and rabbits for 3 cycles of 3-time daily injections for 3 days and in dogs for 3 days of 3-time daily injections. In all tested species, the main toxicity was hematological with pronounced anemia, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia related to bone marrow alteration. These effects were often reversible. In most of studies, mortality occurred, even at the lowest doses. Deaths in dogs and rabbits were attributed to infection secondary to immunosuppression. The testes were a target organ in mice, rats, dogs and rabbits. Decitabine induced irreversible testicular toxicity with testicular atrophy, decreased germ cells and spermatozoa numbers. The intestine was also damaged in dogs (congestion and necrosis) and rabbits (enteropathy).</p><p>The NOAEL in mice was 0.1 mg/kg. No NOAEL can be established in the other species; they were &lt; 1.2 mg/kg in rats and dogs and &lt; 0.75 mg/kg in rabbits.</p><p>The genotoxicity assessment of decitabine was based on two conventional in vitro tests and nonconventional published studies. In the Ames test, decitabine was not mutagenic. However, it should be noted that all the recommended strains were not used (E. coli or S. typhi TA102 were missing) and</p><p>bacteriotoxicity was observed at low concentrations. It was clearly mutagenic in a gene mutation test in mouse lymphoma cells. Published studies gave conflicting results with regards to genotoxicity.</p><p>However, decitabine induced chromosomal aberrations in human pro-B cells and was positive in the SMART test in Drosophila melanogaster. Furthermore, it was positive in vivo in transgenic mice. Based on the submitted data, decitabine should be considered as genotoxic.</p><p>No conventional GLP-compliant carcinogenicity studies were submitted. Studies using different protocol are available in the literature and gave conflicting results. However, in the study using a protocol close to the conventional 2-year study, decitabine showed a clear carcinogenic potential. Therefore, based on the submitted data, decitabine should be considered as a potential carcinogen. Decitabine was clearly teratogenic in mice and rats. It induced a wide-range of skeletal malformations at doses of 0.3 mg/kg in mice and 0.4 mg/kg in rats while no maternal toxicity was observed. There are no adequate data on the use of Dacogen in pregnant women. The potential risk for humans is unknown. Based on results from animal studies and its mechanism of action, Dacogen should not be used during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception. If</p><p>Dacogen is used during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving this medicinal product, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the foetus.</p><p>Decitabine-induced changes in gene expression may play a role in the abnormal embryonic development.</p><p>Decitabine reduced mating capacity and behaviour and decreased fertility in mice exposed in utero.</p><p>The adverse effects were more pronounced in males than in females. In F1 males, decreased IGF-1 levels and altered sexual behaviour were also observed.</p><p>The effects observed in juvenile animals were the same as in adult animals. The hematopoietic system was the main target organ and irreversible testicular toxicity was also caused by the treatment in immature males.</p><p>No safety margins can be calculated for repeat dose in mice, carcinogenicity or reproductive toxicity because some of the submitted studies were from literature and no toxicokinetic measurements were included in the protocols.</p><p>NOAEL could not be defined in repeat dose toxicity studies due to hematological toxicity and/or mortality. Therefore, safety margins were often around 1.</p><p>Decitabine was administered via the intended clinical route (i.e. intravenous) in toxicity studies. No concern about local tolerance was raised from these studies or from clinical practice.</p><p>In mice, after a single injection, degraded decitabine showed similar toxicity to non-degraded decitabine as reported in studies 079392 and 079379. However, the relevance of this study is limited since no analysis of the degraded solution is performed. In a 3-day study, rabbits were treated with decitabine or decitabine spiked with impurities. No obvious differences were noted between the treated groups.</p><p>Decitabine PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as log Pow does not exceed 4.5.</p><p>Therefore decitabine is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.7.">Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects</head><p>The main toxic effects were myelosuppression, inhibition of spermatogenesis and intestinal enteropathy. All toxicities were reversible with exception of the testicular toxicity, which did not fully reverse after a recovery period of up to 6 weeks in rabbits. Most of the toxicities observed from treatment with decitabine are likely to be related to the cytotoxicity of the molecule.</p><p>The submitted non clinical data support the intended indication.</p><p>Decitabine was highly toxic in animals where it induced death and severe haematological and testicular toxicity. It is also considered genotoxic, carcinogenic, teratogenic and it impairs fertility. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distribution</head><p>After IV infusion of decitabine 20 mg/m 2 over 1 hour over 5 consecutive days the PK of decitabine In vitro data showed a negligible plasma protein binding (&lt;1%). Additionally, decitabine is a poor P-gp substrate as well as a poor P-gp inhibitor, suggesting that there is limited potential for inhibition of Pgp in vivo.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Elimination</head><p>In the human mass balance study, the predominant route of excretion of total radioactivity was via the kidneys with approximately 90% excreted in the urine. Unchanged drug in urine accounted for approximately 4.2% of the total radioactive dose. The mean cumulative excretion of total radioactivity in feces accounted for approximately 0.48% of the dose. The high total body CL (mean = 267 L/h), low urinary excretion of unchanged drug in the urine (4.2% of the dose), and high urinary excretion of metabolites indicates that decitabine is predominately eliminated by metabolism. It is clear that decitabine CL is much higher than the normal hepatic blood flow (90 L/h) which is due to the metabolism of decitabine by cytidine deaminase which is present not only in the liver but in the kidneys, intestinal epithelium, and blood, as well.</p><p>Intracellularly, decitabine is activated through sequential phosphorylation via phosphokinase activities to the corresponding triphosphate, which is then incorporated by the DNA polymerase. In vitro experiments with microsomes suggested that there was only a minor involvement of cytochrome P450</p><p>(CYP) enzymes in the degradation of decitabine. The results from the human radiolabeled mass-balance study indicated that the CYP system is not involved in the metabolism of decitabine.</p><p>Decitabine is primarily metabolized by enzymatic degradation. In vitro experiments with cytosolic fractions, and by making use of inhibitors of cytidine deaminase (ie, tetrahydrouridine [THU]), demonstrated that metabolism of decitabine is mainly mediated through liver, kidney, gastro-intestinal and/or blood cytidine deaminase rather than by CYP450 isoenzymes. Results from the mass-balance study showed that unchanged decitabine in plasma accounted for approximately 2.4% of total radioactivity in plasma. The unidentified metabolites M1 and M2, and M4 (the latter confirmed to be formed by oxidative deamination combined with ring opening and deformylation) accounted for approximately 48.2% to 57.0% (sum of M1 and M2) and 31.2 to 40.3% (M4) of the injected radioactivity in plasma. Although the structural identity of the metabolites M1 and M2 is not definitively known, evidence was collected that the pivotal toxicology species are also exposed to the 3 major human plasma metabolites. The major circulating metabolites do not contribute to the pharmacological activity, since the 4-amino-1,3,5-triazin-2(1H)-one ring is no longer intact in metabolite M4, and since the polar metabolites M1 and M2 have lost the sugar moiety and are likely to result from cytidine deaminase-mediated oxidative deamination.</p><p>No pharmacogenomics evaluation has been conducted.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special populations</head><p>According to the population PK, the inter-individual variability was 70.6% and 55.7% for central volume and clearance, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impaired renal function:</head><p>The PK of decitabine have not been formally studied in patients with renal insufficiency. Results from the mass balance study in cancer patients with radioactive 14C-decitabine</p><p>showed that approximately 90% of the administered dose of decitabine is excreted in the urine with only 4.2% of the unchanged drug. The major circulating metabolites are believed to be not pharmacologically active as described above. In addition, population PK analysis indicated no Assessment report EMA/620205/2012 Page 44/79 significant PK parameter dependencies on normalized creatinine clearance, an indicator of renal function. Thus, decitabine exposure is not likely to be affected in patients with impaired renal function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impaired hepatic function:</head><p>The effects of hepatic impairment on the PK of decitabine have not been formally studied. Results from human mass-balance study and in vitro experiments mentioned above indicated that the CYP enzymes are unlikely to be involved in the metabolism of decitabine. It is unknown whether or not hepatic impairment may have an effect on the cytidine deaminase which is mainly responsible for decitabine metabolism, but it seems unlikely since this enzyme is not only found in the liver, but in the kidneys, intestinal epithelium, and blood as well. In addition, population PK analysis indicated no significant PK parameter dependencies on total bilirubin concentration despite a wide range of total bilirubin levels (0.2 -2.9 mg/dL). Thus, decitabine exposure is not likely to be affected in patients with impaired hepatic function.</p><p>Gender : Population PK analysis of decitabine showed that men had a slightly higher CL (12.1%) than women. However, this difference is small relative to the inter-individual variability in CL (55.7%) and</p><p>thus it is not clinically relevant.</p><p>Race: Most of the patients studied were Caucasian (95%). There seemed to be no apparent race effect on decitabine exposure from the limited data available.</p><p>Weight: The volume of distribution at steady state is proportional to body weight. Clearance has been shown to be proportional to BSA. Dosing by BSA would provide similar exposures (AUC) for patients of different body sizes.</p><p>Elderly: According to the population PK, Decitabine PK were not dependent on age (range studied 40 to 87 years; median 70 years).</p><p>Children: No PK data in children have been submitted.</p></div>

These tests included the following:</p><p>o Inhibitory potential of decitabine towards 6 major human CYP isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) in pooled human liver microsomes o Induction potential of decitabine towards 5 major human drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4/5 and CYP2E1) using cultures of primary human hepatocytes</p><p>The bidirectional permeability of decitabine was studied in MDR1 transfected MDCK cell monolayers, both in absence and presence of cyclosporine A, a known P-gp inhibitor. It was demonstrated that decitabine was a poor P-gp substrate, suggesting that its biodistribution is not dependent on the expression or activity of this efflux transporter protein. Decitabine was also shown to be a poor P-gp inhibitor. As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (&lt;1%), interactions due to displacement of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected.</p><p>No formal clinical drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted for decitabine. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanism of action</head><p>DNA methylation represents one of the major epigenetic modifications of the genome involved with regulation of gene expression without affecting the primary DNA sequence. The methylation of cytosine residues at cytosine-guanosine dinucleotides (CpG islands) in DNA is mediated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). DNA methylation is associated with the control of gene expression.</p><p>Hypermethylation of CpG islands is seen in MDS and AML tumour types.</p><p>After cellular uptake and phosphorylation, decitabine is incorporated into DNA where it irreversibly inhibits DNMTs through covalent adduct formation with the enzyme.

Decitabine does not induce cell cycle growth arrests that could be self-limiting to decitabine incorporation into DNA. Once incorporated into DNA, the trapping of DNMT and therapeutic effects of decitabine will persist in the absence of circulating plasma levels of decitabine. Therefore, intermittent schedules of decitabine administration should be effective in managing hematological malignancies given the persistence of the active DNA-decitabine complex.</p><p>Decitabine showed strong anti-tumour activity in several in vivo pre-clinical leukemia models and such activity was dose dependent in all studies and schedule dependent. Both extending duration of infusion or by repeating shorter courses of treatment over several days increased the antitumor effects.</p><p>•</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between plasma concentration and effect</head><p>In non-clinical in vivo tumour models, exposure time was an important factor relative to the efficacy of decitabine; longer exposure via intermittent dosing schedules was more effective than a single higher dose at the same dose intensity in producing an anti-tumoral effect while minimizing toxicity. The The cycles were timed every 4 to 8 weeks depending on recovery. Analysis of PBMCs showed that the 20 mg/m 2 regimen had the greatest extent of hypomethylation and the best CR rate compared to the alternative regimens.</p><p>No clinical data have been provided on pharmacodynamic interactions or on genetic differences in PD response.</p><p>Assessment report EMA/620205/2012 Page 47/79</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.4.">Discussion on clinical pharmacology</head><p>The PK properties of decitabine following 20 mg/m 2 DACOGEN administered daily as a 1-hour IV infusion for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks were evaluated in 45 patients in 2 Phase II studies and 1 Phase III study In addition, a Phase I radiolabeled mass-balance study was conducted to characterize the PK, metabolism and routes of excretion of 20 mg single DACOGEN dose ( 14 Cdecitabine) given as IV infusion over 3 hours in 4 cancer patients. A study in patients using a 3-day, 15 mg/m 2 regimen (DACO-018) was included in the population PK analysis.</p><p>The analytical method used for determination of decitabine plasma concentrations (LC/MS/MS) presents adequate performance (e.g., intra-batch accuracy and precision ranged between [-5.50% -1.33%] and [5.95% -7.77%], respectively). Moreover, blood sampling was performed using tubes preloaded with tetrahydrouridine (THU) as in vitro inhibitor of plasma cytidine desaminase.</p><p>All PK parameters were calculated using conventional non-compartmental methods and actual times of blood sampling.</p><p>The steady-state volume of distribution following daily 1 h intravenous infusion of 20 mg/m 2 DACOGEN over 5 days for 4 weeks is 116 L for a 70 kg cancer patient with BSA of 1.73 m 2 , indicating distribution of the drug into peripheral tissues. The in vitro plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible (&lt;1%) and therefore decitabine is unlikely to displace co administered medicinal products from their plasma protein binding. In addition, decitabine has been shown to be a weak inhibitor of P-gp mediated transport in vitro and is therefore also not expected to affect P-gp mediated transport of coadministered medicinal products. Similar observations for the volume of distribution were seen in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, and monkey, indicating distribution to peripheral tissues.</p><p>There is the potential for a drug-drug interaction with other agents which are also activated by sequential phosphorylation (via intracellular phosphokinase activities) and/or metabolized by enzymes implicated in the inactivation of decitabine (e.g., cytidine deaminase, an enzyme for which genetic polymorphism with significant impact on PK and then on toxicity have been described for other drugs Pharmacokinetic -pharmacodynamic (PD) studies have not been conducted with DACOGEN due to the practical difficulties of conducting such studies. The modelled Population PK analyses incorporated subjects representative of the vast majority of the target population (i.e., BSA of 1.6 to 2.5 m 2 ). These analyses concluded that clearance was proportional to body surface area.</p><p>Decitabine metabolism is not mediated by the CYP450 enzyme system but by oxidative deamination.</p><p>Therefore no formal drug interaction studies have been carried out. The inhibitory and induction potential of decitabine towards human CYP isoenzymes as investigated in vitro, is considered very limited. In addition, there is no known involvement of CYP in the metabolism of decitabine as shown in the human mass-balance study. As a consequence, CYP-mediated metabolic drug-drug interactions are unlikely. Furthermore, patients in clinical studies were being co-administered a range of other medications and no clinically significant interactions were noted.</p><p>Studies in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been conducted. The need for dose adjustment in patients with renal hepatic impairment has not been evaluated. Caution should be exercised and patients should be monitored closely.</p><p>No dose-response or exposure-response data are available. No data regarding relationship between degree of DNA demethylation and response rate and/or adverse events or between drug exposure and response rate and/or adverse events have been provided.</p><p>In addition to its role in DNA demethylation and cytotoxicity, decitabine is likely to have secondary pharmacodynamic effects, including immunosuppressive, antimicrobial, mutagenic, embryotoxic, teratogenic, and tumourigenic effects. These secondary effects are common with other nucleoside analogues used as antiviral and antineoplastic agents.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy data and additional analyses</head><p>An increase in median survival of 2.7 months was considered as clinically meaningful in such a particular setting.

In this analysis, a 23% reduction in mortality risk was observed with DACOGEN treatment compared with TC. The median OS in months (95% CI) was 4.5 (3.8, 5.5) in the TC group and 7.9 (6.0, 9.3) in the DACOGEN group. The HR (95% CI) was 0.77 (0.62, 0.94); p-value= 0.0109</p><p>In addition, an analysis of more mature survival data collected 1 year after the initial CCO was provided. The results were consistent with those of the primary study analysis. The median OS (95% CI) was 5.0 (4.3, 6.3) months in the TC arm and 7.7 (6.2, 9.2) months in the DACOGEN arm. The estimated HR was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.99), nominal p-value=0.0373; representing a slightly larger (18%) reduction in the risk of mortality with DACOGEN treatment.</p></div>

The number of patients included in study DACO-017 was small; however, these patients contributed for about 19% of the patients exposed to Dacogen, included in AML data set. Patients in study DACO-017 may have dose delay and/or 25% dose reduction. Moreover, patients included in the two studies DACO-016 and DACO-017 were different in term of duration of exposure.</p><p>Therefore, the two studies data could not a priori be pooled and the results from the provided integrated AML studies should be taken with caution.</p><p>Only data collected in study DACO-016 are relevant to provide a comprehensive assessment of the safety of DACOGEN in the claimed indication.</p><p>The applicant also presented the MDS set including 4 MDS studies (DACO-020 and ID03-0180; D-0007 and EORTC-06011).

The percentages of AES in relation with myelosuppression are higher in DACOGEN treatment group than in cytarabine treatment group.</p><p>In the AML studies, DACOGEN-treated subjects had higher rates of most infections than the cytarabine groups, including Grade 3 or 4 infections. Febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection were the most common infections.</p><p>Adverse events of special interest: In the integrated AML studies, adverse events of special interest were experienced by 89% of subjects in the cytarabine group and 92% in the DACOGEN group:</p><p>• For all subjects in the AML studies DACO-016 and DACO-017 who received DACOGEN, 73% experienced a myelosuppression event; 69% experienced a Grade 3 or 4 event.

Febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection were the most common infections.</p><p>• In the integrated AML population, bleeding events occurred with similar frequency in DACOGEN treated subject (11%) and cytarabine-treated subjects (13%). Gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred more frequently with cytarabine treatment, while intracranial bleeding was reported more frequently with Decitabine treatment.</p><p>• In the AML population, skin eruptions occurred more frequently in DACOGEN-treated subjects. These were almost exclusively low-grade.</p><p>• For the AML population, Cardiac Rhythm abnormalities were reported by 20% in the cytarabine group, and 19% in the Decitabine group. Tachycardia was experienced by similar percentages of subjects in the cytarabine (5%) and Decitabine (6%) groups. In the integrated AML studies, neurological events were experienced by 3% of subjects in the cytarabine treatment group and 4% in the DACOGEN group. These events were primarily intracranial haemorrhage experienced by 1 subject in the cytarabine group and 6 subjects in the DACOGEN group.</p><p>The adverse reactions identified with Dacogen are presented in the table below. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety in special populations</head><p>In the DACOGEN treatment group, there was a higher incidence of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events in women compared to men (43% versus 32%).</p></div>

All types of adverse events occurred at lower rates in the TC group. As expected from its mechanism of action interacting with DNA methylation, decitabine is teratogenic in animals, causes impairment on male fertility and is mutagenic. No clinical data are available.</p><p>Acute myeloid leukemia is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults. The incidence of AML increases with age and is primarily a disease of older (&gt;60 years) individuals. Over this age pregnancies are not expected but we can easily imagine that younger women could be exposed especially because of the possible use of decitabine to treat severe sickle cell disease.</p><p>Having all these elements in mind, the CHMP agrees with the wording of section 4.4, as proposed by the Applicant.</p><p>Patients with a history of severe congestive heart failure or clinically unstable cardiac disease were excluded from clinical studies and therefore the safety and efficacy of Dacogen in these patients has not been established.</p><p>From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.2.">Conclusions on the clinical safety</head><p>Overall, the safety profile of decitabine is globally in accordance with what could be expected from a cytotoxic compound in such a setting. The incidence of serious and/or drug related AEs was slightly higher in the decitabinearm than in the TC/Cytarabine arm. Infections were the most commonly reported drug related adverse event: decitabine -treated subjects had higher rates of most infections than the cytarabine groups, including Grade 3 or 4 infections. Febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection were the most common infections.</p><p>Percentages of early deaths were comparable between the cytarabine (8.7%) and decitabine (8.5%) treatment groups. Percentages of subjects who died during treatment or within 30 days after the last dose of study drug were also similar: 30.3% in the cytarabine treatment group and 32.8% in the decitabine treatment groups. More deaths were apparently attributed to cardiac causes in decitabinetreated subjects in DACO-016 (13 subjects who received decitabine versus 6 who received cytarabine).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Beneficial effects</head><p>Decitabine is a cytidine deoxynucleoside analogue intended for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed de novo or secondary acute myeloid leukaemia. Acute myeloid leukemia is a clonal disorder caused by malignant transformation of a bone marrow-derived, myeloid stem cell or progenitor cell, which demonstrates arrested maturation and aberrant differentiation. Untreated, AML is a rapidly progressing and fatal disease that requires prompt attention.</p><p>The management of older patients with AML is guided by performance status, cytogenetics, and the presence of comorbidities which limit the ability of the patient to tolerate cytotoxic (combination) induction chemotherapy. For patients 75 years or older, or those less than 75 for whom intensive chemotherapy is not appropriate, palliative therapy with hydroxyurea or 6-mercaptopurine with supportive care measures are used for white blood cell count control. Several studies suggested that low-dose cytarabine may be effective in this population.</p><p>This MAA is mainly based on one single pivotal study, a Phase III, randomized, multicenter study of DACOGEN compared with Treatment Choice (TC) consisting of the subject's choice (with physician's advice) of the current standard-care options of low-dose cytarabine or supportive care. These results are supported by a single-arm, Phase II study, DACO-017, in patients with AML.</p><p>The main objective of the pivotal study was to compare DACOGEN, administered at a dose of 20 mg/m2 once daily for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks, with TC. Overall, 485 subjects were enrolled.</p><p>The analysis of the primary endpoint shows an increase in median survival of 2.7 months, which is considered as clinically meaningful in such a particular setting. However, it did not reach statistical A statistically significant difference was also shown for the secondary endpoint of CR+CRp rate in favour of DACOGEN (17.8%) versus TC (7.8%), p=0.0011 and the median time to response was 4.3 months (95% CI: 3.8, 5.1) and responses were durable (median: 8.3 months, 95% CI: 6.2, 11.4).</p><p>The median PFS was 2.1 months in the TC arm and 3.7 months in the DACOGEN arm (HR=0.75; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.91, p=0.0031).</p><p>The beneficial effects seen in the pivotal study were also seen in the small uncontrolled phase II study with a reported median EFS of 5.7 months (CI 3.1, 8.1), response rate of 23.6% (CI 13.2, 37) and overall survival of 7.6 months <ref type="bibr">(CI 5.7,</ref><ref type="bibr">11.5)</ref>. In addition, patients in the age group between 60 to 64 years were also recruited in this phase II study and showed similar results to patients in older age groups (median OS patients 60-64 years 7.7 months, CI: 3.5, 15.2).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risks</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unfavourable effects</head><p>More than 99% of subjects in the DACOGEN and cytarabine treatment groups experienced adverse events. All types of adverse events occurred at lower rates in the TC group.</p><p>The most frequently observed adverse events in the decitabine group of the AML studies (occurring in ≥ 30% of all subjects) were pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, nausea, febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, and diarrhoea. The most frequently observed Grade 3 and 4 adverse events were related to myelosuppression, as expected in AML population. In the AML studies, DACOGEN-treated subjects had higher rates of most infections than the cytarabine groups, including Grade 3 or 4 infections.</p><p>Febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection were the most common infections.</p><p>Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were more common in decitabine -treated subjects (80%) than in subjects treated with cytarabine (73%) due to higher rates of Infections and Infestations, Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders, and Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders. Moreover in the decitabine group, except for "vascular disorders" and "nervous system disorders", all the percentage of serious adverse events are higher than in cytarabine group.</p><p>In the integrated AML studies, the percentages of subjects who died during treatment or within 30 days after the last dose of study drug were 30.3% in the cytarabine treatment group and 32.8% in the decitabine treatment groups. The Applicant states that more deaths were attributed to cardiac causes in decitabine -treated subjects in DACO-016; more than 60% of these cases were from a single country (Poland), with 6 cases from a single site.</p><p>Ninety-eight percent of the 530 subjects in the integrated AML studies discontinued treatment, most often due to disease progression in the cytarabine (55%) and decitabine (44%) groups. For the 530 subjects in the integrated AML studies, adverse events led to treatment discontinuation for 10% of subjects in the Supportive Care group, 47% in the cytarabine group, and 37% in the Decitabine group. The most frequently reported events leading to treatment discontinuation were disease progression (cytarabine: 16%; decitabine: 11%), and general physical health deterioration (cytarabine: 13%; decitabine: 9%). In the Supportive Care group, the most frequently reported adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation was bronchopneumonia (7%; cytarabine: &lt;1%; decitabine: &lt;1%). Drugrelated adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were experienced by 8% of subjects in the cytarabine group and 7% in the decitabinegroup. The majority of these were due to myelosuppressive events or infections. No drug-related adverse event led to treatment discontinuation for more than 1% of subjects in either treatment group.</p><p>The overall safety profile of Dacogen was similar to low dose cytarabine and while some undesirable effects were seen more often with Dacogen (such as infections and febrile neutropaenia) it may be due to the longer exposure to Dacogen treatment (median 4 cycles Dacogen versus 2 cycles Cytarabine).</p><p>The use of supportive anti-infectives and cytokines was also similar in both treatment arms.</p><p>Non clinical data have shown irreversible inhibition of spermatogenesis but the relevance of this finding is considered limited in the older AML patient population.</p><p>No data is available in patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment but no significant toxicity was seen in relation to the kidneys or liver. There is appropriate caution wording in the SPC for the use of Dacogen in patients with liver impairment and renal impairment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects</head><p>The extent of data submitted (682 subjects treated with Dacogen) is satisfactory and no significant uncertainty regarding unfavourable effects has been raised.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit-risk balance</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects</head><p>The analysis of the primary endpoint of the pivotal study shows an increase in median survival of 2.7 months, which is considered as clinically meaningful in such a particular setting. Statistical significance was reached after a second post hoc analysis.</p><p>Response rates showed also a highly significant benefit in favour of DACOGEN. Most of all, responses were durable. The difference in median PFS was statistically significant and in favour of the Dacogen arm. Most of these beneficial effects were also observed in the small uncontrolled phase II study.</p><p>Given the very poor prognosis in this cancer population an improvement in survival of at least an extra 2.7 months is considered of clinical relevance. Other favourable effects in response rate, progression free survival and event free survival when compared to standard of treatment are also considered to be very important from the clinical point of view.</p><p>Overall, the safety profile of decitabineis globally in accordance with what could be expected from a cytotoxic compound in such a setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit-risk balance</head><p>The benefit-risk balance is considered positive in view of the clinically relevant effect in terms of overall survival and an acceptable safety profile.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion on the benefit-risk balance</head><p>Benefits of currently available treatments for AML are diminished with advancing age because of the greater frequency of poor prognostic indicators: an increase in median survival of 2.7 months, as observed in study DACO-016 is therefore considered as clinically meaningful in such a particular setting.</p><p>The issue of a possible positive impact of patients who might benefit from induction therapy on study DACO-016 results has been addressed by a post-hoc analysis that only included patients who would not be considered suitable for induction chemotherapy. This analysis, which showed that approximately 94% of patients in DACO-016 would not be considered suitable for induction chemotherapy, was not meaningfully different from the ITT-analysis. As a consequence, it is considered that the use of Dacogen should be limited to to adult patients aged 65 years and above with newly diagnosed de novo or secondary AML according to the WHO classification who are not considered candidates for standard induction chemotherapy.</p></div>

It could enhance the expression of tumor-associated antigens and the recognition of tumor cell by cytotoxic T cells. The depletion of DNMT could not only be due to covalent link with DNA. It has been demonstrated decitabine may also induce the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of DNMT1. Decitabine also acts by inducing cytotoxicity. Incorporation of decitabine into DNA generates DNA-DNMT adducts that interfere with DNA synthesis during cell replication and produce apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis appeared related to the re-expression of the tumor suppressor p73.</figDesc></figure>

However, in an analysis of PD data from an investigator-initiated Phase 1 study of Dacogen for the treatment of subjects with AML or MDS, a dose-dependent decrease in global DNA methylation was observed. Also other clinical studies in patients with haematological malignancies have analysed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from subjects treated with 5, 10, 15, 20, and 100 mg/m 2 Dacogen per day for methylation of Alu and long interspersed nucleotide element (LINE) DNA sequences. There was a dose dependent linear decrease in methylation of both these markers in samples from subjects that received doses of 5 to 20 mg/m 2 per day. There was no significant additional decrease in methylation above 20 mg/m 2 per day, similar to in vitro observations. The extent of hypomethylation correlated with clinical response.The phase II study ID03-0180 evaluated three schedules of decitabine in 128 patients with myelodysplasia. Response rate (RR= CR+PR) was assessed after a minimum of 3 cycles of treatment in the three arms:o Arm A: 10 mg/m 2 IV over 1 hour once a day for 10 consecutive days o Arm B: 20 mg/m 2 IV over 1 hour once a day for 5 consecutive days o Arm C: 10 mg/m 2 SC twice a day for 5 consecutive days</figDesc></figure>

Therefore, caution should be exercised if these drugs are combined with Dacogen. Pharmacogenetic evaluation has not been performed in addition to PK and Phase I studies, since DNA samples were not available.Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed from PK data obtained in 59 patients (44 males and 15 females). According to the results, the inter-individual variability was 70.6% and 55.7% for central volume and clearance, respectively. Intra-individual variability of decitabine concentrations was moderate (CV=31.6%). The value proposed as intra-individual variability (31.6%) should correspond to residual variability. This value is rather high for pharmacokinetic analysis after IV infusion. It was probably due, at least partly, to the fact that no interoccasion option was used to analyse data from two cycles. Use of interoccasion option is recommended since "ignoring such interoccasion variability (IOV) may result in biased population parameter estimates"[J Pharmacokinet Biopharm. 1993    Dec;21(6):735-50.

These studies led to the development of 2 Phase 3 studies (Study D-0007 in the U.S. and Study EORTC-06011 in Europe) that also evaluated the 3-Day dosing regimen in patients with MDS. Results of D-0007 led to the approval of the 3-Day regimen for the treatment of patients with MDS in the U.S. and 35 other countries.</figDesc></figure>

Moreover in Dacogen group, except for "vascular disorders" and "nervous system disorders", all the percentage of serious adverse events are higher than in cytarabine group.For the AML studies, Grade 3 or 4 serious adverse events were experienced by 34% of subjects in the Supportive Care group, 63% in the cytarabine group, and 73% in the Decitabine group. System organ classes with the highest incidences of Grade 3 or 4 serious adverse events were Infections and Infestations (Supportive Care: 28%; cytarabine: 30%; Decitabine: 47%) and Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders (Supportive Care: 0%; cytarabine: 28%; Decitabine: 35%).

In clinical studies, the majority of patients had baseline Grade 3/4 myelosuppression. In patients with baseline Grade 2 abnormalities, worsening of myelosuppression was seen in most patients and more frequently than in patients with baseline Grade 1 or 0 abnormalities. Myelosuppression caused by Dacogen is reversible. Complete blood and platelet counts should be performed regularly, as clinically indicated and prior to each treatment cycle. In the presence of myelosuppression or its complications, treatment with Dacogen may be interrupted or supportive measures instituted.The percentage of patients experiencing treatment emergent adverse events leading to dose delay or cycle delay was higher in Dacogen group than in cytarabine group. The SmPC section 4.2 highlights that approximately one-third of patients receiving DACOGEN required a dose-delay.In DACO-016 patients received a median of 10 weeks of cytarabine treatment and 19 weeks of DACOGEN treatment. The exposure-adjusted death rate should be used with caution especially in oncology area. Therefore, the list of adverse drug reactions presented in Section 4.8 of the SmPC highlights those adverse reactions which had a fatal outcome and that in clinical studies, 30% of patients treated with DACOGEN and 25% of patients treated in the comparator arm had adverse events with an outcome of death during treatment or within 30 days of last dose of study drug.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>
