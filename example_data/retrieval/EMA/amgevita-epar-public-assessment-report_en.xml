ABP 501 is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody which binds and neutralizes human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), a cytokine which mediates the inflammatory response. The amino acid sequence of ABP 501 is identical to that of the reference product, adalimumab.

ABP 501 has the same dosage form and strength as adalimumab.</p><p>By binding TNFα and preventing its interaction with its receptors, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) 1A (p55) and TNFRSF1B (p75), adalimumab interferes with downstream signaling and thereby suppresses immune processes central to several chronic inflammatory diseases.</p><p>Based on extensive similarity data presented herein, ABP 501 is expected to have a safety and efficacy profile similar to that of adalimumab in all indications approved for adalimumab. Thus, the proposed indications for ABP 501 are based on those currently approved for adalimumab. CHMP stated that a pivotal study based on 52 weeks on Ps population could be acceptable. However, the CHMP considered the PS study as not sufficient as standalone to support biosimilarity and it would have preferred to have the 12 month data from the RA study as pivotal or in support of Ps data. Moreover, the preferred primary endpoints by CHMP were PASI variable analyzed as a continuous outcome in Ps study and ACR20 in RA study.</p></div>

Among the in vitro studies submitted by the Applicant, binding to FcyRs isoforms FcyRIIB and FcyRIIIB as well as binding to complement (Cq1) were not taken into consideration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Quality aspects</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Introduction</head><p>AMGEVITA, referred to as ABP 501, has been developed as a biosimilar candidate to Humira (adalimumab). ABP 501 is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin IgG1 that specifically binds to human tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and neutralises the biological function of TNF by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leucocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1).</p><p>ABP 501 also binds Fcγ receptors (FcγRs) and induces both antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) in vitro.</p><p>The amino acid sequence of ABP 501 is identical to that of the reference product, adalimumab. The ABP 501 and adalimumab active ingredients are manufactured using recombinant DNA technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. ABP 501 has the same dosage form and strength as adalimumab.</p><p>AMGEVITA is presented as solution for subcutaneous injection and two strengths are proposed:</p><p>-20 mg in a single-dose pre-filled syringe (PFS), each containing 20 mg of adalimumab in 0.4 mL (50 mg/mL) solution;</p><p>-40 mg in a single-dose pre-filled syringe or single-dose pre-filled pen (PFP) (SureClick, each containing 40 mg of adalimumab in 0.8 mL (50 mg/mL) solution.</p><p>Adalimumab is formulated with glacial acetic acid, sucrose, polysorbate 80, sodium hydroxide and water for injections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Active Substance</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General information</head><p>ABP 501 is a fully human monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) subclass expressed in the CHO cell line and consists of 2 heavy chains (HC), and 2 light chains (LC) of the kappa subclass.</p><p>ABP 501 contains 32 total cysteine residues involved in both intrachain and interchain disulfide bonds.</p><p>Each HC contains 451 amino acids with 4 intrachain disulfides. Each LC contains 214 amino acids with 2 intrachain disulfides. Each HC contains an N-linked glycan at the consensus glycosylation site on Asn301. As is typical with mammalian cell culture processes, the HC C-terminal Lys451 is mostly removed due to the presence of carboxypeptidases during the cell culture process.</p><p>The molecular formula for the predominant ABP 501 HC isoform (C-terminal glycine) is C2191H3392N582O677S15, not including N-linked glycans. The molecular formula for ABP 501 LC is C1027H1610N282O332S6. The theoretical mass of fully assembled, disulfide-bonded ABP 501 antibody with HC C-terminal glycine and without the addition of the N-linked glycans is 145,192 Da. The predominant glycan moiety, A2G0F, has an empirical formula of C56H92N4O39 and has an empirical mass of 1,445 Da. Thus, the theoretical mass of glycosylated ABP 501 containing 2 N-linked glycans (1 per heavy chain) is 148,081 Da. The experimentally determined predominant ABP 501 mass is 148,083 Da, in agreement with the theoretical value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacture, characterisation and process controls</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description of manufacturing process and process controls</head><p>Amgen Thousand Oaks (ATO), USA, is responsible for active substance manufacture. The ABP 501 clonal production cell line was generated at Amgen. The ABP 501 amino acid sequence was derived from a commercial lot of Humira (adalimumab). The deduced DNA sequence was synthesised for the heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) variable regions, and the variable region DNA was used to construct the ABP 501 HC and LC expression plasmids in a stepwise manner.</p><p>The host cell line used for expression of ABP 501 is a serum-free CHO cell line. This cell line was derived by gradually adapting the CHO cell line to grow in serum-free medium.</p><p>The HC and LC expression plasmids were co-transfected into CHO cells. Following a clone screening and selection process, final clone 11-1-300-23 was selected as the ABP 501 production cell line.</p><p>A two-tiered cell banking system consisting of a master cell bank (MCB) and a working cell bank (WCB) was established. The cell banks were characterised in accordance with ICH guidelines.</p><p>A single production lot is initiated from a single WCB vial thaw. The manufacturing process for the active substance includes steps for cell culture, harvest, purification with a series of chromatography, viral inactivation/filtration and ultra-/diafiltration steps. The container closure system for drug substance is a 10 L polycarbonate container with a polypropylene screw thread cap and thermoplastic elastomer gasket.</p><p>Reprocessing is not currently proposed during manufacturing of ABP 501 active substance.</p><p>In-process controls (IPCs) are used to monitor the manufacturing process to ensure that the active substance and resulting finished product will meet quality requirements, or to monitor process consistency. IPCs are part of the control strategy. Justification of the IPC limits is provided.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Control of materials</head><p>a) Control of source and starting materials of biological origin:</p><p>The Applicant's viral safety program minimises the potential for introduction of adventitious virus into the ABP 501 manufacturing process through contaminated raw material and includes the following: -MCB and WCB have been extensively tested and found to be free of detectable adventitious agents; -Raw materials have appropriate certification, and no animal derived materials are used in the manufacturing process. An assessment of risk for transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) transmission was performed on all raw materials from transfection of the cell line through fill and finish of the finished product.</p><p>Materials not directly used in the process, but which may come into contact with the product during manufacturing or primary packaging, were also identified and assessed.</p><p>Based on the complementary strategies of the viral safety program and adventitious agents safety evaluation results, Amgen concludes that the viral risk and TSE risk associated with this product are negligible.</p><p>b) Raw materials:</p><p>All manufacturing raw materials are received, identified, sampled, quarantined, tested, labeled, and released according to established written procedures. A listing of raw materials and process solutions, including cell culture media, stock solutions and buffers, used in the ABP 501 active substance manufacturing process was provided. Compendial materials are tested to the referenced compendia. Specifications are provided for all non-compendial materials and media solutions used in the process. c) Source, history and generation of cell substrate:</p><p>The ABP 501 clonal production cell line was generated at Amgen. The source, history and generation of the cell substrate and cell line development was described.</p><p>d) Genetic stability of the production cell line:</p><p>The genetic stability for ABP 501 production has been assessed from thaw of the MCB through creation of the WCB to the end of production (EOP) for a typical active substance lot and also through the EOP to the limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA) for manufacturing.</p><p>The LIVCA was determined by extending the population doublings from a typical EOP run during ABP 501 manufacture at the commercial site and scale. The culture age is controlled to less than the LIVCA in the commercial manufacturing process through operational controls.</p><p>Lot release data for the active substance generated from the LIVCA production culture confirmed that product quality at the defined LIVCA is consistent with results for other lots produced with lower population doubling levels.</p><p>The results for the molecular characterisation of the integrated HC and LC genes demonstrate that the ABP 501 cell line is stable throughout the production process to the currently established LIVCA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Process validation</head><p>The active substance manufacturing process was validated. Validation acceptance criteria for process parameters and performance indicators were based on reference product data, process understanding gained from prior knowledge, process characterisation and clinical manufacturing. Process validation was completed for cell culture, harvest, purification and in-process pool holds. Validation data demonstrate that the process is controlled and reproducible while consistently producing active substance having the required quality when conducted within the defined operating ranges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacturing process development</head><p>Minor changes to controls and processing conditions were implemented during development to ensure process robustness. Product quality assessments have demonstrated that the active substance produced throughout development is comparable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characterisation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Elucidation of structure</head><p>All elucidation of structure studies were conducted on an ABP 501 active substance lot. ABP 501 was characterised to provide a comprehensive understanding of its structural and functional properties and to support an assessment of criticality of product quality attributes (PQAs). ABP 501 characterisation included the following studies: − Biochemical studies to assess primary structure, glycosylation, disulfide structure, charge variants, and size variants; − Biophysical studies to assess secondary structure, tertiary structure, and thermal stability; − Biological studies to demonstrate the mechanism of action, including antigen specificity and Fc functionality; − Forced degradation studies to assess how ABP 501 responds to specific stress conditions to reveal potential degradation pathways under typical and atypical conditions and further understand PQAs.</p><p>The in vitro biological activity of ABP 501 was studied using recombinant protein and cell-based binding and functional assays, assessing both antigen-specific functions and Fc-mediated functions. The characterisation methods were intended to assess (1) antigen binding, (2) potency with respect to the primary mechanism of action, and (3) Fc functionality.</p><p>ABP 501 exerts its effects in autoimmune diseases primarily via binding to soluble TNF-α (sTNF-α) and the membrane-bound precursor form, transmembrane TNF-α (mbTNF-α). Additionally, ABP 501 binds neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and Fc gamma receptors (FcγR) and mediates effector functions such as ADCC) and CDC in vitro.</p><p>ABP 501 binds human and non-human primate TNF-α with high affinity, but does not bind human lymphotoxin alpha (LTα).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impurities</head><p>Based on comprehensive characterisation of ABP 501, the product-related impurities were identified. The product-related impurities were determined to have a potential impact on patient safety or product efficacy. The product-related impurities present are present at very low levels in the active substance and are controlled to acceptable levels by the manufacturing process. The risk assessment and overall control strategy for each of these product-related impurities was presented.</p><p>Process-related impurities encompass those derived from or introduced during the active substance manufacturing process. Included are impurities from the host cell line and raw materials used during cell culture and downstream processing.</p><p>The removal of host cell proteins (HCP), DNA, and residual protein A in the active substance process was evaluated in commercial-scale runs. Removal of these impurities to predefined acceptance criteria was demonstrated during challenge studies performed at small-scale during process characterisation and confirmed during process validation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specification</head><p>The active substance specification covers identity, purity, potency, adventitious agents and general tests.</p><p>During the development of ABP 501, a number of analytical procedures were included on the clinical active substance specification that have been either removed from the specification due to additional product and process understanding and demonstrated process performance, or moved to in-process testing due to the presence of redundant testing points.</p><p>The dataset used to calculate and establish the acceptance limits included release testing results from the active substance, as well as stability data from active substance lots held at the recommended storage conditions. Considerations for establishing the specification acceptance criteria also included: − Process and product characterisation data; − Manufacturing experience with similar monoclonal antibody processes; − Formulation development studies; − Analytical method performance; − Acceptable safety levels; − World Health Organization (WHO), United States Pharmacopeia (USP), European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines.</p><p>Active substance lot release results with numerical limits are routinely tracked as part of a data monitoring program. The monitoring program establishes statistically derived control limits per internal procedures that are more stringent than the lot release and stability acceptance limits. This additional control provides early visibility to potentially adverse product quality trends that may be observed during manufacturing and/or stability and ensures a timely response and quality investigations.

The Applicant performed a comprehensive analytical similarity assessment using state-of-the-art methods and has determined that: -ABP 501 is analytically similar to the reference product; -ABP 501 has the same primary amino acid sequence as the reference product; -ABP 501 has the same strength as the reference product.</p><p>The ABP 501 clinical program includes 3 studies to support the application (  To support the use of clinical data generated using adalimumab sourced from both regions, Amgen has established a scientific bridge between adalimumab (US) and adalimumab (EU), which is based on 3pair wise analytical and PK comparisons. To complete the analytical comparisons, all 3 products were subjected to the same testing plan. Thus, the analytical similarity assessment consists of 3-pair wise comparisons <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">(Table 2)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Active substance</head><p>The information requested to support adequate control of viral safety has been provided, the characterisation for qualification of the MCB, WCB and end-of-production (EOP) cells is concluded acceptable.</p><p>The descriptions of the different manufacturing steps are considered acceptable. As requested, supplementary documentation has been provided supporting adequate control of elution of product from the chromatography steps. As previously requested, the Applicant also confirmed that operation of any of the critical process parameters (CPPs) outside the defined acceptable range will trigger the same investigations as is described for action limits controlling IPC tests.</p><p>An acceptable justification has been provided for not including analyses of the primary and higher order structures in the studies conducted supporting comparability of active substance before and after introduction of optimised control of the production bioreactor step.</p><p>In primary assessment, the proposed integrated control strategy was considered insufficient to assure that the commercial active substance is of the appropriate quality (Major Objection). Indeed, control strategy as initially proposed seemed to allow a large degree of process flexibility without an adequate testing of relevant product quality attributes at release (or in-process) to assure consistency of commercial lots. Comprehensive supportive documentation has been provided in the Applicant's response, including for example the introduction of new IPC tests as well as the tightening of action limits/specifications for tests applied for in process and release control of relevant product quality attributes to assure consistency of commercial lots. The overall control strategy applied in production is considered satisfactorily supported.</p><p>The specification for control of active substance is only limited. However, in-process tests for control of purity are indicated at different steps in the downstream process. Their designation as IPC tests in production of active substance is considered acceptable as the same tests are controlled by specifications for finished product. The action/rejection criteria proposed for these tests were however considered to be set too wide but were tightened to ensure that the finished product will comply with the end-of-shelf-life specifications.</p><p>Similarly, tests for control of general properties are indicated as IPC tests. As the Applicant has agreed to follow the recommendations given in the primary assessment on the control of these parameters on the level of finished product, this is considered acceptable.</p><p>The upper limit proposed for specification hat were considered to be set too wide to assure that the ADCC activity of commercial ABP501 finished product will remain within the range that has been shown to be safe and efficacious has now been tightened and acceptably justified.</p><p>Taken together, the stability data included in the primary submission and submitted response, are considered acceptable to support the proposed shelf life for active substance of 48 months, when stored at the recommended storage temperature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Finished product</head><p>Relevant tests are included in the release specification for the finished product. The specification was revised in accordance with CHMP request.</p><p>Updated stability data were provided during the review, including up to 36 months data from primary and supportive stability lots in the statistical evaluation of data, giving satisfactory support that finished product remains within the proposed stability specification. The statistical evaluation of the extended stability data was conducted in line with the recommendations in the ICH Q1E guideline.</p><p>As requested, the Applicant re-evaluated and tightened the finished product end-of-shelf-lifespecification for acidic species in order to assure that acidic species remain within the range that can be considered clinically qualified. In relation to this issue, the Applicant also reduced the shelf life from 36 to 24 months. This is acceptable</p><p>The maximum of 14 days hold time at up to 25°C and protected from light, within the 24 months shelf life of the finished product, is acceptable as the worst case conditions tested give enough assurance of the requested stability.</p><p>The information provided regarding adventitious agents safety has been revised in accordance with the request by CHMP and is considered acceptable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biosimilarity exercise</head><p>The design of the biosimilarity studies is considered acceptable, including with a few exceptions relevant analytical methods for assessment of comparability in the structure, function and heterogeneity of ABP 501 and reference product. The concerns raised on whether the ADCC and CDC bioassays where sufficiently sensitive to detect differences related to variability in the levels of high mannose and the galactosylation profile, have been satisfactorily addressed, showing adequate performance of both analytical procedures.</p><p>In most aspects, the approaches used for establishment of the biosimilarity assessment criteria are considered acceptable. However, no discussion or justification was presented supporting the proposed definition of acceptance criteria for statistical evaluation of data. According to the proposed criteria, conclusion on comparability will be made if &gt; 90 % of individual batches of biosimilar product fall within the calculated range of mean + 3 Standard Deviations (SD) for reference product, which leads to acceptance of a too wide range in product quality. However, as data from the analysis of individual batches are provided for all analyses where results have been statistically evaluated, assessment can be made independent of the statistical model used.</p><p>For assays/attributes where a change over time is observed when stored at the recommended storage condition, all values were adjusted for material age prior to computing the quality range. Even though this approach was considered theoretically sound, it was pointed out that this could introduce a bias instead of a correct age-adjustment. The Applicant gave satisfactory reassurance of the reliability of the comparison of data.</p><p>The ABP 501 product batches included in the biosimilarity assessment were not considered representative for commercial production, as the proposed specifications opened for a considerably wider range in quality of commercial finished product than those studied in the comparative analysis. In response to the raised concern, the specifications for control finished product purity have been tightened. The limits have now been satisfactorily revised and justified.</p><p>Taken together, the data presented is considered acceptable to show that there are no significant qualitative or quantitative differences between reference and biosimilar product at end of storage besides those that can be attributed to differences in the levels of C-terminal lysine.</p></div>

Blood samples for analysis of antibodies capable of binding adalimumab were taken pre-dose and day 16, 29 and 63. A total of 203 adult healthy male (116) and female (87) volunteers aged 18-45 years were enrolled. There were 7 subjects who prematurely discontinued the study and thus 196 subjects (96.6%) completed the study.</p><p>The mean serum concentration-time profiles were similar following a single SC injection of all 3 treatments over the entire course of sampling.</p><p>The results are presented below.   The extrapolated AUC was less than 20% in most subjects.

Therefore, no PD markers were incorporated into the ABP 501 PK study, and clinical endpoints were utilized in the phase 3 studies in subjects with moderate to severe RA (Study 20120262) and Psoriasis (Study 20120263). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.4.">Discussion on clinical pharmacology</head><p>The study design of the pharmacokinetic study (study 20110217) is satisfactory and was accepted in the CHMP advice. A parallel design is acceptable considering the long half-life of adalimumab (approximately 2 weeks) and the potential influence of immunogenicity. The use of healthy volunteers is agreed in line with the Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal Assessment report Amgevita EMA/106922/2017 Page 46/120 antibodies -non-clinical and clinical issues. The treatment groups were similar in age, ethnicity and BMI. Supportive PK data from the phase 3 studies in patients are also available in line with guideline recommendations. The 40 mg SC dose is the normally recommended dose (although higher initial doses are given for some indications) and the use of this dose is endorsed. Blood samples for analysis of antidrug antibodies were taken when there are still remaining drug concentrations in the blood, but the ADA assay methods used were assessed for tolerance in presence of drug.</p><p>Analysis with correction for protein content was the primary comparison according to the initial statistical analysis plan, but this was revised in a late amendment and instead the unadjusted PK parameters were used for the primary analysis.</p><p>For therapeutic proteins there is no firm guidance on content correction. This topic is addressed by EMA guideline (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1) reporting: "Correction for protein content may be acceptable on a case-by-case basis if pre-specified and adequately justified, with the results from the assay of the test and reference products being included in the protocol". The difference in protein content was large when comparing the batch used as test product (95.8%) and the batch used as EUsourced reference product (106.6%). Thus, it is considered relevant to compare protein-adjusted data.</p><p>For unadjusted AUC 0-t , AUC 0-∞ and C max the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of the test and reference products fell within the pre-specified acceptance range of 80.00-125.00% when comparing ABP 501 to the reference product from EU as well as from US and the 90% confidence intervals included 1. Both comparisons are important since the RA study was performed using US reference product. Also when comparing the US versus the EU reference products the results fell within the prespecified acceptance range of 80.00-125.00% for all three parameters, although the confidence interval for C max did not include 1.</p><p>For the protein content adjusted C max and AUC last the 90% CI fall within 0.80-1.25 and include 1. T max and t ½ was similar for all three formulations. However, for AUC inf the 90% CI falls outside the 0.80 -1.25 limits and is statistically higher than both US and EU adalimumab (point estimate 16%).</p><p>A higher exposure of ABP 501 compared to the reference product was observed based on the primary parameter AUC inf adjusted for protein content (point estimate 16%), which may indicate a difference in clearance and/or relative bioavailability. Since the difference in protein content was large (95.8% for test product compared to 106.6% for EU reference product) it is considered relevant to compare protein-adjusted data. Therefore the Applicant provided an extensive discussion to support the claim of PK similarity between ABP 501 and adalimumab. The reason why the protein content adjusted 90% CI of AUC inf fell outside the BE margin is likely due to shortcomings in the study design, specifically the duration of PK plasma sampling was somewhat short. This resulted in exclusion of a relatively large proportion (13.3%) of the non-compartmental analysis (NCA) derived AUC inf values, mostly due to a large extrapolated area (&gt;20%). The exclusion led to increased imprecision in the comparison between the products with respect to AUC inf . As a consequence biosimilarity was not concluded. explanation that the observed difference in AUC inf is caused by exclusion of data. Based on the totality of PK data, PK similarity can be concluded.</p><p>The sensitivity analysis with antidrug antibody negative subjects was within the pre-specified acceptance range for the comparison between ABP 501 and the EU reference product. It is clear that half-life and exposure is lower in subjects positive for antidrug antibodies compared to subjects negative for antidrug antibodies.</p><p>The results indicate a higher formation of binding anti-drug antibodies for adalimumab (EU) and similar formation of binding anti-drug antibodies for ABP 501 and adalimumab (US). According to the Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies -non-clinical and clinical issues (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010) a lower immunogenicity for the biosimilar would not preclude biosimilarity.</p><p>For study 20120263 it is agreed that trough serum concentrations were similar between ABP 501 and adalimumab (EU) treatment groups since no notable difference in mean geometric ratios was observed and since the confidence intervals included 1. This supports similar exposure in this population.</p><p>For study 20120262 it is agreed that trough serum concentrations were similar between ABP 501 and adalimumab (US) treatment groups. This supports similar exposure in this population.</p><p>No new pharmacodynamic data has been submitted as part of this application. This is considered acceptable for a biosimilar application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.5.">Conclusions on clinical pharmacology</head><p>The Applicant has sufficiently explained and justified the difference in exposure (protein content adjusted AUC inf . Pharmacokinetic similarity has been sufficiently demonstrated between ABP 501 and the reference product). Thus biosimilarity can be concluded from a clinical pharmacology perspective</p></div>

However, a study in psoriasis was also conducted which gathered further data on immunogenicity.</p><p>The inclusion criteria for the RA study are acceptable. The endpoints used are validated and in line with scientific advice, and what has been used in previous RA studies. The primary endpoint was proportion of ACR20 at week 24, and equivalence measured as Risk ratio (RR). The choice of ACR20 as primary endpoint is in accordance with given CHMP Scientific Advice and is endorsed. It is considered acceptable to present the results as RR. Secondary efficacy endpoints used are validated and in line with what has been used in previous RA studies.</p><p>The sample size of 500 subjects seems adequate to demonstrate equivalence between the ABP 501</p><p>and Humira groups assuming a margin of (0.738, 1/0.738) for the primary efficacy endpoint RR of ACR20. The calculation is based on an expected ACR20 response for both ABP 501 and Humira of 63% at week 24. The choice of the 0.738 margin on a multiplicative scale would correspond to an absolute margin of more than -16% on the additive scale. This could be considered too wide. It is noteworthy that if the same multiplicative margin of 0.738 is considered but assuming a higher expected ACR20 response at week 24 for both arms (i.e. a response of similar magnitude to that obtained in the study:</p><p>Assessment report Amgevita EMA/106922/2017 Page 86/120 72%) the resulting absolute margin would be inflated to about -20%. However, in light of the results observed this does not represent an issue that could compromise the reliability of the study.</p><p>For DAS-28 CRP, the equivalence margin of ±0.6 was chosen. This has been endorsed in a scientific advice.</p><p>Sensitivity analyses used the FAS with non-responder imputation, FAS based on observed cases, and the per protocol (PP) analysis set based on observed cases. Inferential analyses were performed only for the primary endpoint.</p><p>Randomisation and blinding methods are acceptable.</p><p>All randomized subjects in the US sites assessed their pain at the injection site on a 95-mm horizontal VAS instead of a 100-mm scale due to a printing error. Therefore the results captured on the shorter VAS scale were multiplied by a factor of 100/95. This may not provide correct results in the extremes of the scale, since the choice of point in these regions may be more related to the absolute distance from min/max, than proportion of the whole scale. However, there is no apparent better way to handle this error, which affected both treatment groups equally (68 subjects in the ABP group, 69 in the adalimumab group). It is not considered to significantly impact the evaluation of similarity, which is supported by a sensitivity analysis where the results from the US sites were excluded. CHMP considered that the issue was appropriately handled.</p><p>The number of protocol violations was relatively high (10.5%) but equally distributed between groups (9.5% vs 11.5%). The most common major protocol violation was mis-stratification at randomization because of incorrect designation to prior biological use category.

PASI 75 is used as a secondary endpoint. Primary endpoint was analysed using the full analysis set (FAS) with missing values imputed using LOCF. This is considered acceptable. The equivalence analysis was based on 95% Confidence Intervals which is endorsed. However, the equivalence margin of (-15; 15) in percent improvement in PASI score at week 16 is considered wide.</p><p>However, the Applicant clarified that the sample size calculation was formally derived using PASI percent improvement (and not the original endpoint PASI75 response) assuming a Standard Deviation (SD) of 31.7. Taking into account the results of the primary endpoint this does not represent an issue that could compromise the reliability of the study.</p><p>Randomization and blinding methods are acceptable.</p><p>Discontinuation through week 16 was balanced between the treatment groups. The proportion of subjects that completed the IP, as well as the study, was balanced between the 2 groups adalimumab treated patients re-randomized to ABP 501, and re-randomized to stay on adalimumab.</p><p>The number of protocol violations was relatively high, but equally distributed between groups.</p><p>Assessment report Amgevita EMA/106922/2017 Page 87/120 A total of 59 major protocol violations mainly related to the use of prohibited medication in particular topical steroids, were reported. 36 subjects used any topical corticosteroids through the entire study.</p><p>However, through week 16 only three (two in the ABP 501 and one in Adalimumab group) out of the 36 subjects were identified as using class I (super potent) and/or class II (potent) topical corticosteroids that were considered prohibited as for protocol. Of these three subjects, only one patient (in the ABP 501 group) was included in the per protocol (PP) analyses. Therefore, this single subject is unlikely to have had any meaningful impact on the analysis of similarity of ABP 501 to adalimumab.</p><p>Demographics and baseline psoriasis characteristics were reasonably balanced between the treatment groups.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary efficacy endpoint</head><p>At week 24, 74.6% of subjects in the ABP 501 group and 72.4% of subjects in the adalimumab group met the ACR20 response criteria. The RR of ACR20 for ABP 501 versus adalimumab was 1.039 with the 2-sided 95% CI (0.938, 1.152). The point estimate is thus close to 1 with a narrow CI and is considered to indicate similarity between ABP 501 and adalimumab.</p><p>When calculating the responder rate, LOCF was only used for patients with post-baseline values. A sensitivity analysis including patients with baseline values has been provided. The result does not change the evaluation of clinical equivalence between ABP 501 and the reference product.</p><p>The chosen equivalence margin for RR of ACR20 for ABP 501 versus adalimumab at week 24 has not been clinically justified by the applicant. However, the point estimate of the primary endpoint is close to 1 and has narrow CI limits. Given that after 24 weeks of treatment an effect plateau may have been reached, making the end point less sensitive, the totality of data, including response in the respective treatment arms per visit is also highly important.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary efficacy endpoints</head><p>At week 2, 35.4% of subjects in the ABP 501 group and 24.5% of subjects in the adalimumab group met the ACR20 response criteria. The RR of ACR20 for ABP 501 versus adalimumab was 1.421 with the 2-sided 95% CI of (1.086, 1.860). ABP 501 thus showed a statistically significant superiority over Humira after 2 weeks treatment. At week 4, the difference between ABP 501 and adalimumab was smaller than week 2, and no longer statistically significant. At weeks 8 and 18 results were very similar between groups, with 95% CI for the risk difference within +/-10%. At week 12, ABP 501 again showed a statistically significant better effect. In summary, at week 2 and week 12, a significant difference in effect between the original product and the biosimilar is seen. However, since there are no statistically significant differences in other variables (ACR50, ACR70 and DAS28-CRP) in early time points, the difference seen at early time points in ACR20 is most likely a chance finding rather than a real difference in onset of action.</p><p>In contrast to the ACR20 results, for ACR50, the difference at week 2 was not statistically significant, although the point estimate was well above 1 (RR 1.7). At week 12, there was a difference in favour of adalimumab.</p><p>Assessment report Amgevita EMA/106922/2017 Page 88/120</p><p>For ACR70 response, no statistically significant differences were seen and the point estimates of RR and RD were low. It should be noted that for ACR70 response, numbers are small, in particular in the beginning of the study.</p><p>At week 24, the difference between treatment groups in the mean change from baseline in DAS28-CRP also demonstrated similarity.</p><p>At week 24, 30.5% in the ABP 501 treated group and 35.5% in the adalimumab-treated group achieved DAS28-CRP remission. At earlier time points, the opposite was seen, i.e. higher proportions achieving DAS28-CRP remission in the ABP 501-treated group. Numbers are small, however the results also supportive of similarity.</p><p>Mean injection site pain rating scores were lower in the ABP 501 group compared with the adalimumab group at each study visit. This difference in scoring rates between groups in favour of ABP 501 is not considered to question biosimilarity, since it is most probably due to differences in excipients.</p><p>The incidence of subjects developing binding or neutralizing antibodies was similar between ABP 501 and adalimumab.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 20120263: Psoriasis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary endpoint</head><p>The PASI score decreased substantially through Week 16 in both groups. The mean percent improvement in the ABP 501-treated group was 80.91% vs 83.06% in the adalimumab group. The treatment difference was -2.18% with 95% CI (-7.39, 3.02). This is a narrow CI, well within the predefined interval of ±15%, and also within the more conservative ±10. The results of the primary endpoint are thus considered to be compatible with clinical equivalence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary endpoints</head><p>When looking at the results for the originally discussed primary endpoint, proportion of PASI 75, the point estimate for the treatment difference at week 16 was -7.73% in favour of adalimumab.. Also at earlier visits the same trend was seen. However, clinical equivalence was evaluated only for the primary efficacy endpoint and the margin of ±15 refers only to PASI percent improvement. Moreover, the study was not powered to evaluate equivalence of secondary endpoints against the same predefined margin of the primary endpoint.</p><p>The difference between groups in favour of adalimumab that was noted for PASI 75 was detected also for sPGA (n.s.). The trend in favour of adalimumab in sPGA was maintained through Week 50. In contrast, the BSA involvement results as well as PASI 50 90 and 100 results are compatible with similarity.</p><p>After re-randomisation at week 16 the number of patients per group is subsequently smaller. This results in more uncertain point estimates with wider CIs. Improvement achieved in PASI during the first 16 weeks of treatment was maintained over time, equally in both groups.</p><p>Larger differences between ABP501 and Humira were observed in the PASI percent improvement at</p><p>week 16, when patients with neutralizing antibodies are considered. However, from baseline to week 50 no important differences were observed in PASI percent improvement between ABP501/ABP501 group and Humira/Humira group in presence of neutralizing-antibodies. Moreover, despite the higher incidence of neutralizing anti-drug antibodies reported in the Humira/ABP 501 group compared to both ABP 501/ABP 501 and Humira/Humira groups it is of reassurance that patients who shifted from Humira to ABP501 treatment did not show a worsening in efficacy (in terms of PASI percent improvement) compared to patients who remained in Humira treatment. In addition, a clinical review of individual data for neutralizing ADA positive subjects at week 16 was performed along with the titers. Individual data provided, although difficult to analyse, do not seem to suggest a possible correlation between neutralizing ADA titre and efficacy results in either treatment group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.4.">Conclusions on the clinical efficacy</head><p>Overall, ABP 501 has in the RA study shown similarity to adalimumab in several analyses. The primary endpoint was met, and similarity at week 24 was indicated with low point estimates and narrow CI intervals both for ACR20 RR and Risk Difference. Also mean change in DAS28-CRP showed high similarity at all visits. ACR20 results per visit showed significant differences which may be interpreted as indicating a faster onset of effect for ABP 501, which could question similarity. However, these results are not seen for DAS28 which is favourable, or for ACR50 or ACR70, and as such it is concluded, that the difference seen at week 2 in ACR20 is likely to be a chance finding rather than a true difference.</p><p>Also the psoriasis study met the primary endpoint with a point estimate of difference of 2% with narrow CIs, indicating similarity. The secondary endpoints PASI 75 and sPGA showed point estimates of 7% difference with a wide CI.</p><p>Overall, clinical similarity between ABP 501 and adalimumab has been demonstrated.</p></div>

The described differences in AE rates between treatment groups within the Gastrointestinal Disorder SOCs are based on small numbers, and the difference between groups in the psoriasis study was not seen in the RA study and is not considered to question the similarity.</p><p>Through the entire psoriasis study, it was noted that there is a slight difference in any AE rates between the group that stayed on adalimumab (78.5%) and the groups that switched to ABP 501 (85.7%) or received it through the whole study (86.2% the lower incidence of local reactions for ABP 501, the imbalance in any AEs between groups does not increase, probably because most of the subjects with injection site reactions also experienced other AEs. No particular PT contributing to the imbalance was identified, and there was no trend for more SAEs among the ABP 501-treated subjects.</p><p>In the phase I study in healthy subjects, headache, oropharyngeal pain and sinus congestion were reported at a higher rate for the ABP 501-treated group (28.4%), than in the pooled adalimumab group (21.8%). In contrast, no difference in headache rate was seen in the RA study, and in the psoriasis study the difference was in favour of ABP 501. These diverging results make it plausible that they are by chance findings. There was an imbalance in injection site reactions, in favour of ABP 501. This could be explained by differences in the excipients in ABP 501 and adalimumab drug product, which most likely contributed to the difference in pain perception among subjects.</p><p>In both studies, hypersensitivity AEs was higher in ABP501 arms.</p><p>Data on hypersensitivity and injection site reactions adverse events stratified by ADA and neutralizing ADA status has been provided for both studies. Overall, although a certain trend is noted between ADA positivity and occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions in ABP501 treated subjects, the limited number of subgroups hampers a sound conclusion.</p><p>In the RA study liver enzyme elevation events, occurred in 4.9% of subjects in the ABP 501 group and in 3.8% in the adalimumab group. Also in the psoriasis study, slightly more cases of liver AEs were observed in the ABP 501 group through Week 16 with a more obvious imbalance between the ABP 501/ABP 501 group and the adalimumab group post week 16 in liver AE (5.9 vs 2.5%). However, numbers are small, and the reported events occurred to a large extent in subjects with abnormal baseline values. Besides the liver AEs discussed above, there were no clinically meaningful differences in laboratory results between the ABP 501 and adalimumab groups in neither the RA nor the Psoriasis study.</p><p>The purpose of this biosimilar development program is to evaluate similarity between ABP 501 and the reference product, adalimumab, including an assessment of the effects of any observed differences between the products, if such differences exist. Therefore, in accordance with regulatory guidances, safety studies in special groups (eg, pediatrics and elderly) are not required and are not included in this marketing application.</p><p>In the RA study, the incidence of subjects developing binding or neutralizing antibodies was similar between ABP 501 and adalimumab.</p><p>When evaluating anti-drug antibodies (ADA), in the RA study, the point estimate for the difference in ADA rate is very low, 0.219% (-8.139%, 8.578%). Through Week 16 in the psoriasis study, the treatment difference was higher, -8.122% (-18.242%, 1.998%). Since it is in favour of the biosimilar candidate, this was considered to be acceptable by CHMP since it is in accordance with "Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies"</p><p>(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). In the psoriasis study, subjects did not use MTX concomitantly, and this is probably the explanation for the higher rate of ADAs in this population.</p><p>It is noted that the ADA rate was high through the entire psoriasis study, lasting for 52 weeks (68.4%, 74.7% and 72.7% in the ABP 501/ABP 501, adalimumab/adalimumab, and adalimumab/ABP 501 groups, respectively).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.">Disease or condition</head><p>AMGEVITA is being developed as a biosimilar candidate to Humira (adalimumab). The proposed indications for AMGEVITA are those approved for Humira.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">Main clinical studies</head><p>The efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity similarity of ABP 501 to adalimumab is based on data from Study 20120262 in adult subjects with moderate to severe RA and Study 20120263 in adult subjects with moderate to severe Plaque Psoriasis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Favourable effects</head><p>ABP 501 has been developed as an adalimumab biosimilar. In the development of a biosimilar product, there is no requirement to demonstrate benefit to the patient per se as this has been shown for the reference product. The purpose of a biosimilar application is therefore to demonstrate similarity to the reference product. This has been assessed from a quality, non-clinical, pharmacokinetic and clinical perspective, and the conclusion is based upon the totality of data.</p><p>From a quality and non-clinical perspective, data has been presented that shows that ABP 501 is highly similar to the reference product Humira.</p><p>From a pharmacokinetic perspective, pharmacokinetic similarity is considered sufficiently demonstrated between ABP 501 and the reference product.</p><p>From a clinical perspective, two phase 3 studies have been performed, in RA and psoriasis. The point estimate of the primary endpoint of the RA study (RR of ACR20 at week 24 between ABP 501 and Humira) was 1.039 with the 2-sided 95% CI of RR (0.938, 1.152) and in the psoriasis study the point estimate of the primary endpoint (difference in PASI percent improvement at week 16 between ABP 501 vs Humira) was-2.18 with 95% CI (-7.39, 3.02). Thus, the Primary endpoints were met in both studies, with small point estimates for the difference between the reference product and ABP 501, with 95% CI within narrow limits. Equivalence has been shown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects</head><p>There are no uncertainties or limitations that have an impact on the benefit-risk balance.</p><p>Assessment report Amgevita EMA/106922/2017 Page 117/120</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Unfavourable effects</head><p>The unfavourable effects of ABP 501 are similar to those of Humira, and this application aimed to show that the safety profiles of Humira and ABP 501 are similar. Overall, the safety profile of ABP 501 is considered to be highly similar to that of Humira. No major safety concerns were detected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects</head><p>Through the entire psoriasis study, it is noted that there is a slight difference in any AE rates between the group that stayed on adalimumab (78.5%) and the groups that switched to ABP 501 (85.7%) or received it through the whole study (86.2%). The difference does not seem to be driven by particular PTs, and recalculating AE tables with local AEs excluded did not change the outcome.</p><p>After week 16, i.e. after longer use, there is an imbalance between the ABP 501/ABP 501 group and the adalimumab group in liver AE (5.9 vs 2.5%). However, numbers are small, several of the ABP 501 treated subjects with abnormal liver enzymes had elevated values also at baseline, and it is considered unlikely that this imbalance reflects non similarity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.2.">Balance of benefits and risks</head><p>Since similarity has been convincingly shown, the benefit-risk balance of ABP 501 is regarded as equal to the BR balance of Humira in its authorized indications. Thus, the BR balance of ABP 501 is considered as positive.</p><p>With the totality of evidence, the CHMP considered that it was justifiable to extrapolate the equivalent clinical efficacy and the comparable safety profile from the ABP 501 studies in RA patients to all of the indications where Humira has been approved</p></div>

For each subgroup of stratification factors, age group (&lt; 65 years and ≥ 65 years), race, sex, disease duration group (&lt; 5 years and ≥ 5 years), neutralizing antidrug antibody status, concomitant topical steroid use, and prior use of systemic or phototherapies, the PASI percent improvement at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 was also examined in the subgroups descriptively. This sensitivity analysis used the full analysis set with LOCF imputation. PASI percent improvement was also analyzed based on a repeated measures analysis, where data from all assessed timepoints through the week 16 visit were included as observed for the full analysis set. In addition to stratification variables and baseline PASI score, visit week (as a categorical variable), treatment, and treatment-by-visit interaction were included in this mixed model repeated measures analysis.</figDesc></figure>

Statistical testing was not explicitly made in the model; rather, by modelling it was possible to generate individual predicted AUC inf values for all subjects including the previously excluded subjects. The 90% CI of the geometric mean ratio of these AUC in f values (ABP 501 vs adalimumab EU) was 0.98 to 1.23 (point estimate 1.10) which is similar to the CI for AUC last using NCA evaluation (0.99-1.22, point estimate 1.10), i.e. indicating that if all subjects are included, the protein adjusted AUCinf is comparable between the products. The Applicant has provided additional supportive evidence from a population PK model that protein adjusted AUC inf is comparable between ABP 501 and reference adalimumab.

Serious adverse events were reported infrequently, 4.4% of subjects in Study 20120262 and 6.6% of subjects through the entire study in Study 20120263.No major differences in frequency or pattern of SAEs between treatment arms in the two phase 3 studies have been seen. Numerically, slightly more events in the ABP 501 group were seen in the psoriasis study, the opposite in the RA study. No difference in SAE rates between subjects who continued on Adalimumab in subjects who switched to ABP 501 was seen during the 32 weeks after the switch.PostWeek 16 in the psoriasis study, there was an imbalance between ABP 501 and adalimumab in the infection SOC, mainly driven by PTs representing viral infections, or infections where virus is the predominant pathogen, (nasopharyngitis, URTI, influenza, Oral herpes, Pharyngitis, Rhinitis, herpes zoster, viral infection, laryngitis, viral pharyngitis). In study 20120263 through 16 weeks, the higher incidence of infections in the ABP 501 group was not seen, and in study 20120262 the difference was smaller. The results are considered to be by chance findings.In the RA study, 11 ABP 501-treated subjects experienced any kind of rash (PT: rash, rash erythematous, rash pruritic, rash morbilliform, drug eruption) compared to 5 in the adalimumabtreated group (PT rash, rash erythematous, rash pruritic, rash macular). This trend was not observed through Week 16 in the psoriasis study. Through Week 16, 3 cases of Rash (including PTs Rash, Rash pruritic) were reported from the adalimumab group, 0 for ABP 501. Post Week 16 in the psoriasis study 3 subjects experienced rash in the ABP 501 group and 1 in the adalimumab group. Two subjects reported urticaria after switching to ABP 501, however the AE occurred months after the switching in both cases.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>
