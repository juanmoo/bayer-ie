<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Aerius, with the active ingredient desloratadine (DL), is a H1 antagonist intended for relief of symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis. The indication was extended to allergic rhinitis and to include Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria through Type II variations.</p><p>Desloratadine is the major active metabolite of loratadine and possesses qualitatively similar pharmacodynamic activity with a relative potency approximating 10 to 20 times that of loratadine in vitro, and 2.5 to 4 times that of loratadine in animals. Desloratadine is to be given in a daily dose of 5 mg/day. Seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) is an IgE-mediated inflammatory disease of the nasal mucosa characterised by symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and nasal pruritus. SAR may be accompanied by itching of the throat, eyes and ears, epiphora and oedema around the eyes. Around 20% of cases are accompanied by asthma. The prevalence of SAR amongst patients attending general practitioners is 11 per thousand in Denmark and 20 per thousand in the UK.</p><p>Avoiding allergen exposure is the most effective way of controlling allergic conditions; however, in SAR, total avoidance is almost impossible and as a consequence pharmacological treatment may be needed. Antihistamines are effective in allergic rhinitis, which comprises approximately 80% of rhinitis found in children and 30% in adults. They are effective against rhinorrhea, itching and sneezing but have little effect on nasal obstruction. Clinical trials have shown that, in seasonal allergic rhinitis, between 40 and 80% of patients experience good to excellent symptom relief (approximately twice that induced by placebo).</p><p>In the pharmacological treatment of SAR, oral H 1 receptor antagonists are one of several therapeutic options available and have been proven to be effective as initial therapy in many patients with mild SAR, especially controlling rhinorrhea, sneezing and nasal pruritus. Because antihistamines most effectively block receptor sites before histamine release, best results are obtained when they are administered on a regular basis and as a prophylactic measure prior to allergen exposure.</p><p>The primary goal of H 1 receptor antagonist treatment in SAR is to reduce and eventually to free the patient from symptoms. Therefore, the most popular test for evaluating H 1 receptor antagonist efficacy in SAR is to use a 3-to 4-point scale from absence to very severe presence of key symptoms attributed to SAR. The primary symptoms being evaluated are nasal congestion, sneezing, rhinorrhea, itchy nose/palate/throat and ocular symptoms. To assess the true effect of the study drug, the use of a placebo group is absolutely necessary because exposure to allergens is variable and the improvements in symptom scores following placebo easily reach 20 to 30%.</p><p>Historically, allergic rhinitis is subdivided into two clinical syndromes referred to as SAR and Perennial Allergic Rhinitis (PAR). These classifications are based on the clinical manifestation of AR symptoms in relationship to duration of exposure to differing classifications of allergens. For example, SAR symptoms typically occur in tandem with the pollen season since SAR is triggered by episodic exposure to outdoor allergens (such as pollen and moulds). PAR symptoms typically occur throughout the year since PAR is the result of continual exposure to indoor allergens (dust mites, insects, and animal dander).</p><p>In reality, the division between SAR and PAR is not straightforward because PAR and SAR significantly overlap with respect to pathophysiology (i.e., IgE-mediated inflammation), clinical expression of the disease, and therapeutic management (allergen avoidance, antihistamines, decongestants, and intranasal steroids). Firstly, it is often difficult to differentiate between seasonal and perennial symptoms. Patients with either condition complain of nasal itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion although, nasal congestion is more pronounced in PAR than in SAR and eye itching tends to be less severe. Secondly, PAR symptoms are usually present on a chronic</p><p>The isocratic HPLC method AM535 is demonstrated to separate desloratadine from potential synthesis related impurities (loratadine, DS1 and DS2) and potential degradation products (SCH11334, SCH26485, SCH446721 and SCH13095). There is, however, minimal resolution between two peak pairs (SCH26485/SCH13095 and SCH11334/SCH446721). Gradient HPLC method AM543, on the other hand, is demonstrated to separate all potential impurities from each other and from desloratadine. Specificity of this method is further confirmed by stress studies under different conditions, in which mass balance was demonstrated. <ref type="bibr">Linearity, precision (repeatability, intermediate and reproducibility)</ref>, accuracy and robustness are demonstrated for the determination of desloratadine and SCH11334 with method AM535 and for the determination of SCH11334 and SCH26485 with method AM543. No correction for response factors of the investigated impurities is necessary. The limits of detection are set at 0.25% and 0.02% for methods AM535 and AM543, respectively. The limit of quantitation is 0.05% for both methods.</p><p>All the methods have been adequately validated.</p><p>Batch analyses data are given for four pilot scale (stability) batches and one full scale batch manufactured at the proposed site (using active substance batches from both sources), and these demonstrate consistency of manufacture and compliance with the proposed specification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability of the product</head><p>Four pilot batches (140,000 tablets) manufactured at the proposed site and packed in the proposed blisters were used in the stability studies. For three of these batches, 18 months results at 25°C/60%RH and 6 months results at 40°C/75%RH are presented. One batch was only used for photostability testing (ICH conditions). Testing was performed according to the proposed specification.</p><p>Desloratadine is very stable in the oral lyophilisate, with only low levels (&lt; 0.1%) of degradation products being observed during the stability studies at 25°C/60%RH. Degradation product SCH11334 (N-methyl derivate) is not detected immediately after production but slightly increases up to 0.08%. Other levels of degradation products were often below the limit of quantitation (&lt; 0.05%). After storage at 40°C/75%RH higher levels of degradation products were reported, although total degradation products for all batches were only 0.2% to 0.3% after 6 months at 40°C/75%. The diameter of the tablets was observed to be slightly reduced by storage at 40°C/75%. There were no significant trends in other parameters during either long term or accelerated testing.</p><p>In conclusion, the stability data support the shelf-life claimed in the SPC of 24 months with a storage precaution of "Store in the original package." The absence of a temperature-specific storage recommendation is justified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Syrup Composition</head><p>The syrup is a clear, orange coloured aqueous solution containing desloratadine at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The product is packed in amber glass bottles (Ph. Eur. Type III) closed with a child resistant polypropylene cap. The caps have a polyethylene liner as the product contact surface. A plastic measuring spoon is supplied with the bottle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Active substance</head><p>The manufacture and control (including specifications and test methods) of this active substance are identical to that in the dossier for the film-coated tablet. The stability data presented is also identical to that submitted for the film-coated tablets and the claimed retest period has therefore been fully justified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other ingredients</head><p>Propylene glycol, sorbitol liquid (non-crystallising), citric acid anhydrous, sodium citrate, sodium benzoate, disodium edetate, sucrose and purified water comply with the current requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia. The non-compendial excipients are Color E 110 (supplied by Colorcon) and Natural &amp; Artificial Bubble Gum Flavor #15864 (Virginia Dare). These excipients do not originate from animal sources and are therefore free from BSE/TSE risk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Product development and finished product</head><p>The objective was the development of a stable syrup formulation containing 0.5 mg/ml desloratadine with pleasant organoleptic characteristics, meeting the Ph. Eur. requirements for Preservative Efficacy and amenable to scale-up.</p><p>Desloratadine is sufficiently soluble in acidic aqueous solutions to prepare a simple 0.5 mg/ml solution. Stability of the active substance is demonstrated to be optimal in a solution with a pH between 5 and 6. Therefore, a sodium citrate / citric acid buffer is included in the formulation. Stability is further improved by the addition of disodium edetate.</p><p>Propylene glycol is used for its humectant, anti-freezing and solubilising properties. Laboratory studies indicated that this excipient can enhance the formation of the formyl-desloratadine degradation product. Accelerated stability studies on products prepared with propylene glycol from different suppliers did not show significant changes in the degradation product content.</p><p>Sucrose is used as sweetening agent, although a slight incompatibility with the active substance was shown under stress conditions. Saccharin was not found acceptable from a paediatric point of view. Sorbitol liquid is used as additional sweetener and as anti-cap locking aid. The organoleptic properties are further improved by the addition of the bubble gum flavour and the colorant Sunset yellow (E110). A slight incompatibility between desloratadine and the bubble gum flavour was also observed. The stability of desloratadine in the syrup is however demonstrated in the stability studies presented in part IIF.2. The selection of benzoate as preservative is based on previous experience. Products containing 100% and 80% of the target concentration (0.1%) are demonstrated to pass the Ph. Eur. Preservative Efficacy criteria for oral preparations.</p><p>Although the proposed formulation has initially been accepted by CPMP, the company is requested to further improve the formulation in order to meet current expectations for a paediatric syrup. The company has agreed to assess and, if feasible, implement the following improvements on an ongoing (post-approval) basis:</p><p>• The feasibility of removing the colouring agent from the formulation will be investigated to avoid that the medicinal product is unnecessarily attractive to children.</p><p>• The feasibility of removing the preservative sodium benzoate from the formulation will be investigated.</p><p>Taking into account that the product is intended for long-term use in children, a sugar-free alternative for the currently accepted formulation should be developed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability of the product</head><p>The applicant proposes a shelf life of 24 months with the recommendation: "Do not store above 30°C. Store in the original container."</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Film-coated tablet</head><p>In-vitro studies</p><p>The in vitro studies have focused on the radioligand binding to the histamine H1-receptor (in human recombinant, guinea pig brain and lung and in rat brain) and functional H 1 -antagonism on the isolated guinea pig ileum. These radioligand studies demonstrate that desloratadine has an about 15-fold higher affinity for the H1 receptor than the parent compound loratadine. The main metabolite, the 3-hydroxy glucuronide, was inactive on H 1 receptor on rat brain membranes.</p><p>The specificity of desloratadine for the H 1 receptor was evaluated using a panel of more than 100 receptors and enzymes. These studies revealed that desloratadine had some affinity for H2, serotonin 5-HT7 and various subtypes of muscarinic receptors.</p><p>Desloratadine antagonised the histamine-induced contractions of isolated guinea pig ileum with an approximately 10-fold higher potency than loratadine. The selectivity ratio of desloratadine, however, was lower than that of loratadine. In this study desloratadine was almost equipotent as anticholinergic and antihistaminic agent with a 4 times lower potency than that of atropine. This finding, however, could be a species peculiarity of the guinea pig. Such species differences have been demonstrated in many instances in the case of G-protein-coupled receptors. Other in vitro and in vivo preclininal studies have clearly shown that the anticholinergic activity of desloratadine is seen only at concentrations and doses which far exceed those, which exhibit antihistamine activity. Furthermore, this activity of desloratadine is not considered to be of clinical relevance as there is no evidence in the clinical dossier, that desloratadine has a significant anticholinergic activity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In-vivo studies</head><p>In vivo studies conducted in mice and guinea pigs, by oral administration, have shown that desloratadine is 2.5-4 times more potent than loratadine. In guinea pigs an oral dose of 0.5 mg/kg (about three times the ED50 in this assay) protected 100% of the animals for 8 hours p.a. and 40% at 24 hours p.a. against lethal anaphylaxis induced by i.v. histamine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacodynamic drug interactions</head><p>In vitro studies using mouse, rat, rabbit, monkey and human hepatocytes and liver microsomes as well as recombinant human CYPs and investigation of the effects of desloratadine on drug metabolising enzymes in subacute toxicity studies were performed.</p><p>The preclinical studies do not indicate a clinically relevant potential of desloratadine for liver enzyme induction or drug-drug interactions. However, the applicant has not been able to identify the CYP(s) responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine to 3-hydroxy-desloratadine. The applicant submitted the results of further in vitro and in vivo studies in their response to the List of Questions. The applicant will perform additional studies to try and identify and characterise the enzyme(s) and report these studies as follow up measures.</p><p>General and safety pharmacology</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Central nervous system</head><p>Desloratadine had no behavioural effect at doses up to 300 mg/kg in mice and 12 mg/kg in rats. In mice it had no anticonvulsant effect up to 160 mg/kg. The lack of activity on the central nervous system is likely due to a lack of penetration through the blood-brain barrier. This is supported by a study in guinea pigs showing that following an i.p. injection of desloratadine (6 mg/kg), the ex vivo binding of 3 H-mepyramine in the brain was not inhibited, whereas a similar treatment by chlorpheniramine (2 mg/kg) led to a 50% inhibition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cardiovascular system</head><p>Studies have been performed to evaluate the effect of desloratadine on the QT c interval and the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Among the various potassium channels involved in cardiac repolarisation, the HERG channel, mediating the I Kr current is the one that is impaired in most patients with congenital long-QT syndrome and is blocked by some H 1 antagonists.</p><p>The following studies were performed with desloratadine: whole-cell patch clamp studies on ventricular myocytes, electrophysiological studies on recombinant potassium channels, electrophysiological and mechanical studies of the guinea pig ventricular muscle, ECG of perfused rabbit heart in Langendorff perfusion chamber and in vivo studies in rat, guinea pig and monkey. These studies have revealed some inhibition of the potassium channels with high concentrations of desloratadine. At some targets, loratadine was more potent than desloratadine, but the opposite was 9/60  <ref type="bibr">EMEA 2004</ref> true in other models. The results presented in the dossier are consistent with a recent article showing that among second-generation antihistamines astemizole and terfenadine have a significant inhibitory effect on the HERG channel, whereas loratadine and cetirizine are much less potent <ref type="bibr">(Taglialatela et al, Mol. Pharmacol. 54: 113-121, 1998)</ref>. The results are also confirmed by the findings of a clinical pharmacology study, in which doses up to nine-fold the therapeutic dose were investigated and no ECG changes were seen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gastrointestinal, renal and respiratory function</head><p>Single doses of desloratadine (up to 12 mg/kg) do not exert effects on gastric emptying, intestinal transit time, renal and respiratory function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>Desloratadine is the major active metabolite of loratadine. It is a more potent H 1 receptor antagonist than loratadine itself; however, desloratadine is also a more potent antimuscarinic agent than loratadine when tested at concentrations and doses which far exceed those, which exhibit antihistamine activity. Furthermore, this activity of desloratadine is not considered to be of clinical relevance.</p><p>The studies on cardiovascular system revealed no evidence of blockade of cardiac potassium channels (native or injected currents), no prolongation of the action potential (guinea pig papillary muscle), no prolongation of QTc (animal models and humans) and no evidence of drug induced arrhytmias. The results are furthermore in accordance with the findings of a clinical pharmacology study, in which doses up to nine-fold the therapeutic dose were investigated and no ECG changes were seen. The preclinical results do not indicate any differences between desloratadine and loratadine regarding cardiovascular effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Oral lyophilisate and syrup</head><p>The mode of action of desloratadine and its activity as a H1 antagonist have previously been established. No additional information was therefore been submitted or considered necessary by the CPMP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacokinetics</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Film-coated tablet</head><p>The pharmacokinetic profile of desloratadine was studied in mice, rats, cynomolgus monkeys. Desloratadine and its 3-hydroxy metabolite were initially measured by GC/NPD (gas chromatography with a nitrogen phosphorus detector), while LC/MS/MS (liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry) was used in later studies. The glucuronide of 3-hydroxy-desloratadine was measured following hydrolysis by β-glucuronidase.</p><p>After single dose administration of desloratadine or loratadine to rats and monkeys a non-linear relationship (less than proportional increases) was noted between C max and dose. In all species, exposure to desloratadine (Cmax and AUC) was higher following administration of desloratadine than after an equimolar dose of loratadine. In rats, gender differences in Cmax were observed at all doses.</p><p>In mice and monkeys the desloratadine AUC was 3 to 4 fold higher after desloratadine than after loratadine, but T max was similar (about 2 hours in mice and 3 hours in monkeys).</p><p>Absolute bioavailability of desloratadine was about 50% in male rats as well as in monkeys of both sexes, but about 95% in female rats.</p><p>Binding to plasma proteins was approximately 90% in mice and rats and 85% in monkeys and in humans. In rats, distribution was extensive. Tissue/plasma concentration ratio was &gt; 1, especially in liver and bowel. The concentration of desloratadine in foetal plasma and milk were about 40% and 85% of the maternal plasma concentration.</p><p>Biotransformation by 5-and 6-hydroxylations predominated in the animals, whilst the 3-hydroxylation followed by conjugation to glucuronic acid was the main process in man. For each species used in preclinical pharmacokinetic studies, the profile of metabolites was qualitatively similar after</p><p>The mean CL/F estimate for humans was 28.5 ml/kg·min, however, individuals with a substantially lower clearance were identified (2.7 and 4.3 ml/kg·min). These subjects had t1/2 estimates exceeding 90 h as opposed to 22.8 h in subjects with a normal metabolism.</p><p>A small percentage of a desloratadine or loratadine dose was excreted in urine (0.7 to 5%) and faeces (2 to 15%) of laboratory animals as desloratadine. In humans with normal CL/F values, 1.7 and 6.7% of the dose were excreted in urine and faeces, respectively, as desloratadine, and in one slow metaboliser, 25% (urine) and 17% (faeces) of the dose were excreted as desloratadine. The low amounts of desloratadine recovered in urine and faeces indicate that, in laboratory animals and humans (normal metabolisers), desloratadine is metabolically cleared from plasma. In humans defined as poor metabolisers, desloratadine is cleared from plasma by elimination of parent drug in urine and faeces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Oral lyophilisate and syrup</head><p>The pharmacokinetic profile of desloratadine and its 3-hydroxy metabolite has already been established in several species and therefore no additional data have been submitted or considered necessary by the CPMP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Toxicology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Film-coated tablet</head><p>The toxicology program was designed according to the scientific advice provided by the CPMP in May 1998. In view of the studies performed with loratadine, the CPMP considered that chronic studies beyond 3 months would not be necessary if subchronic studies did not reveal toxic effects different from those of loratadine. Furthermore carcinogenicity studies were not considered necessary for desloratadine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Single dose toxicity</head><p>Acute oral and intraperitoneal toxicity was assessed in rats and mice. LD 50 values after oral administration corresponded to a 3530-6160 fold multiple of the clinical dose. However, single dose toxicity of desloratadine was significantly higher (10 fold) than that of loratadine both in rats and in mice and both by oral or intraperitoneal route; this finding, however, is likely to be due to inherent limitations/artefacts in the acute toxicity studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeat dose toxicity</head><p>Two-week, one-month and three-month toxicity studies comparing desloratadine to loratadine were performed in rats and monkeys.</p><p>In rats, the no-effect dose was 3 mg/kg, which was associated with an AUC about 30-fold higher than the AUC in humans receiving the clinical dose of 5 mg. At higher doses, the following effects were observed: vacuolation corresponding to phospholipidosis in eye, brain, heart, lung, liver, intestines, thyroid, muscle and bone marrow, centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy, renal tubular dilatation and/or renal tubular cell necrosis, muscle fibrosis and myofiber degeneration, oligospermia and cellular debris in seminiferous tubules, and granulosa cell necrosis. These toxic effects have been observed previously in the loratadine toxicity studies. In general the same effects were observed at 30-60 mg/day desloratadine and 120 mg/day loratadine, except for the testicular effects previously observed at doses as low as 2 mg/kg of loratadine. The reproductive toxicity on testicles of male rats is known from loratadine and other antihistamines and thought to be a species-specific phenomenon.</p><p>In monkeys, doses up to 12 mg/kg, associated with an exposure 182-fold higher than the clinical exposure, were generally well tolerated. However, there were minimal phospholipidosis at 12 mg/kg in the three-month study and in the 2-week study a dose of 6.5 mg/kg produced signs of induction of liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 enzymes. As a consequence, the no-effect dose is 6 mg/kg. At higher doses the following toxic effects were noticed: severe emesis, extended abdomen, lethargy,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reproduction toxicity</head><p>Studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. Desloratadine (24 mg/kg) administered to male and female rats prior and throughout mating produced body weight loss without altering fertility. In another study where desloratadine was given to male rats for 70 days, a decreased fertility was observed at 12 mg/kg and oligospermia as well as testicular microscopic alterations were observed in a few animals at the 3 mg/kg dose. In rats, no increase in the incidence of malformations was observed up to 48 mg/kg, but foetal weight was decreased at 24 and 48 mg/kg, the no-effect dose being 6 mg/kg. In rabbits, desloratadine did not decrease foetal weight and was not teratogenic at 60 mg/kg and the no-effect dose was 30 mg/kg. In rat perinatal and postnatal development studies, the NOAEL was 3 mg/kg.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Environmental Risk Assessment</head><p>An assessment of the environmental risk was performed and no significant risk to the environment related to the use of desloratadine is anticipated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion on toxico-pharmacological aspects</head><p>Desloratadine is the major active metabolite of loratadine. It is a more potent H 1 receptor antagonist than loratadine itself and in most preclinical studies desloratadine AUC was higher after desloratadine than after an equimolar dose of loratadine. The practical consequence is that desloratadine can be used at a 5 mg/day dose, compared to 10 mg/day for loratadine. Beyond that decrease in dose, there is no evidence in the Part III of the dossier that there is another advantage in replacing loratadine by desloratadine. In particular, desloratadine is also a more potent antimuscarinic agent than loratadine when tested at concentrations and doses which far exceed those which exhibit antihistamine activity. Furthermore, this activity of desloratadine is not considered to be of clinical relevance.</p><p>The genotoxicity studies showed that neither desloratadine nor the major human metabolite 3hydroxy-desloratadine are genotoxic.</p></div>

The objective of this study was to assess the mucous membrane irritation potential of the DL oral lyophilisate 5 mg tablet when administered transmucosal to the hamster cheek pouch for five consecutive days. Prior to dosing each hamster was anaesthetised using isoflurane. Six</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">12/60  EMEA 2004</formula><p>female hamsters received four tablets on Day 0 (20 mg), two tablets on Day 1 (10 mg) and one tablet (5 mg) on Days 2 through 4. The initial dose of four tablets was reduced due to a possible toxic effect of the DL oral lyophilisate tablet in combination with isoflurane anaesthesia; this was indicated by a longer recovery time from anaesthesia compared with controls. The contralateral cheek pouch of each DL oral lyophilisate tablet-dosed hamster served as an untreated control. Six additional female hamsters underwent physical manipulation (sham dosing) of the cheek pouch. All cheek pouches were examined immediately prior to and ten minutes after dosing.</p><p>One DL oral lyophilisate tablet -dosed hamster was found dead on Day 3. The cause of death was not determined during macroscopic examination. However, the death was attributed to the possible toxic effect of the DL oral lyophilisate tablet in combination with isoflurane anaesthesia as mentioned previously. The doses used in this study were 385 (one tablet) to 1541 (four tablets) times the human dose of 0.1 mg/kg based on a 5 mg dose for a 50 kg human.</p><p>All DL oral lyophilisate tablet-dosed hamsters showed a very slight to slight redness in the dosed cheek pouch ten minutes after dosing on Days 0 through 4 with the exception of no reaction noted for one hamster ten minutes after dosing on Day 2. In addition, one DL oral lyophilisate tablet-dosed hamster showed very slight redness in the dosed cheek pouch prior to dosing on Day 4. No reaction was noted in any of the sham-dosed hamsters.</p><p>In conclusion, DL oral lyophilisate tablets (5mg) were very slightly to slightly irritating to the mucus membrane of the hamster cheek pouch. There were no DL oral lyophilisate tablet-related macroscopic or histopathology findings observed in the hamster cheek pouches associated with the administration of DL oral lyophilisate tablets. The findings in this study do not suggest a significant local irritant effect.</p><p>An assessment of the environmental risk was performed and no significant risk to the environment related to the use of desloratadine is anticipated.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Film-coated tablet</head><p>Desloratadine was initially proposed for the relief of symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). Following a Type II variation the indication was extended to include Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria (CIU). Its mechanism of action is binding as a functional antagonist to the H 1 receptor. Efficacy and safety in SAR has been evaluated in four pivotal, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled studies (C98-001, C98-223, C98-224, C98-225) one of which is a phase II dose finding study (C98-001). In addition, four additional studies on onset-of-action were presented. The total number of subjects who received desloratadine in the phase II and III studies (including the additional studies) is 2,346 patients out of the enrolled 3,282 patients. Efficacy and safety in CIU was evaluated in two, pivotal, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase III studies (P00220, P00221). The total number of patients receiving 5 mg desloratadine in this indication was 211.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cardiovascular pharmacodynamics</head><p>This study (C98-357) was a randomised, 2-way crossover, double-blind, multiple dose (10 days), placebo controlled study in which 24 healthy subjects (12F/12M; 18-50 years) were randomised.</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the electrocardiographic effects (difference between baseline maximum ventricular rate, PR, QRS, QT and QTc intervals and the corresponding day 10 maximum ECG parameters) of desloratadine 45 mg (9 times a daily dose). The secondary objectives of the study were to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of desloratadine and observe the safety and tolerability of the drug. Vital signs and ECGs were performed, and blood samples were collected at pre-specified times for safety and pharmacokinetic evaluations. It is important to stress that subjects with screening ECG QTc values exceeding 420 msec were excluded.</p><p>There was a statistically significant increase compared to placebo in the mean ventricular rate by 9.4 bpm and a statistically significant reduction of the QT intervals. No statistically significant changes were detected for the change between treatment groups in QTc interval between the desloratadine and placebo treatments. Subgroup analysis (by gender) showed that change in ventricular rate was significant in females but not in males and that a significant difference for change of the PR interval was seen for females but not for males. The reduction in QT interval was statistically significant for both males and females.</p><p>In conclusion this study in which subjects with a baseline QTc &lt; 420 msec received 9-fold the clinical dose, showed that there was no evidence of clinically relevant prolongation of the QTc interval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychomotor pharmacodynamics</head><p>The primary objective of the psychomotoric study (study C98-551) was to evaluate and compare the relative effects on psychomotor performance of desloratadine 7.5 mg with and without alcohol in healthy volunteers. The study was conducted as a single-centre, single dose, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover study. All subjects (14F/11M, 21-54 years) received all 4 treatments and there was at least a 5-day washout between each treatment. The subjects completed a Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Serial Add Subtract (ANAM Battery), Psychomotor Vigilance Test, Stanford Sleepiness Scale, and Modified Romberg's Test.</p><p>No significant differences in the psychomotor tests were found between the desloratadine 7.5 mg and placebo groups, whether given alone or with alcohol.</p><p>The influence of desloratadine on the ability to drive and use machines was investigated in a single dose, 3 way crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers. The results were submitted as part of the answers to the List of Questions. The over-the-road driving test showed the effect of desloratadine to be similar to that of placebo, whereas the active control (diphenhydramine) had significantly worse lateral deviation and longer braking time. The results are reflected in the SPC section 4.7.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">16/60  EMEA 2004</formula><p>The influence of desloratadine on ability to fly was investigated in a single dose, 3-way crossover study in 21 healthy volunteers. Desloratadine 5 mg produced no detrimental effects on tasks related to flying ability, including those tasks addressing vigilance, tracking, and complex task performance or on resource management performance or on subjective sleepiness for the measured period of 1 to 6 hours after drug administration. Diphenhydramine, used as an active control, significantly increased subject sleepiness and impaired performance on flying ability tasks. While the sedative effects of multiple dose treatment were not evaluated in this study, the data from this study are predictive of long-term use of desloratadine as: 1) desloratadine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics, as a result no unexpected accumulation has been observed after 28 days 2) the clinical experience with treatment periods up to six weeks has shown a somnolence rate no different from placebo and 3) there were no reports of sedation following administration of desloratadine 45 mg (nine-fold the clinical dose). The results were introduced in section 5.1 of the tablet SPC following a Type II variation. Identical wording was later introduced in the SPC of the syrup and oral lyophilisate following a Type II variation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacokinetics</head><p>The plasma drug concentration assay methods changed during the clinical development. A sensitive and specific LC/MS/MS method for quantification of desloratadine and 3-OH desloratadine was validated with a limit of quantitation (LOQ) of 0.025 ng/ml for both analytes. This method was used in studies C98-352 to C98-357, P00117, P00275, P00311, P01196, and P01380. Studies 197-248, C98-013 and C98-215 used a GC/NPD method, which only quantified desloratadine (LOQ 0.1 ng/ml).</p><p>Following oral administration of 5 or 7.5 mg desloratadine, peak plasma concentrations are usually obtained between approximately 2 to 6 hours after dosing. Food has no effect on the extent of desloratadine absorption.</p><p>Desloratadine is extensively metabolised and only small percentages of the orally administered dose are recovered in the urine (&lt;2%) and faeces (&lt;7%). The major metabolic pathway of desloratadine is hydroxylation in position 3 to form 3-OH-desloratadine that is glucuronidated and the glucuronide conjugate is subsequently excreted in the urine and the bile. The elimination plasma half-life is about 20 to 30 hours.</p><p>Desloratadine has been shown to exhibit linear kinetics over the dose range 5 to 20 mg. Steady state was generally reached by day 7.</p><p>In a randomised multiple-dose study comparing the steady state pharmacokinetic profiles following oral administration of 5 mg (once daily) desloratadine with those obtained following multiple dose administration of 10 mg loratadine (once daily), plasma concentrations of desloratadine, 3-OHdesloratadine and 3-OH-desloratadine glucuronide were observed to be very similar.</p><p>A phenotypic polymorphism in the metabolism of desloratadine was observed in 8.6% of the population evaluated in the clinical pharmacology studies. The frequency of slow metabolisers is estimated to be about 4% based on the pharmacokinetic study P00275, in which the demographics of the subjects are comparable to those of the general SAR population. In slow metabolisers the halflives are much longer (greater than 60 hours) andwith median AUC values approximately 6-fold higher. Maximum desloratadine concentration was about 3-fold higher at approximately 7 hours with a terminal phase half-life of approximately 89 hours. The major route of elimination by a slow metaboliser is via excretion of unchanged drug into urine and faeces. The amount of 3-OHdesloratadine and unchanged drug is less than 10% and over 42% respectively compared to 51% and 8.4% in normal metabolisers. The metabolism does not appear to be mediated by a known cytochrome 450 enzyme. The applicant will perform further studies on the metabolism.</p><p>The effects of race (Blacks versus Caucasians) and gender on the pharmacokinetics of desloratadine following administration of 7.5 mg once daily for 14 days were relatively small. On average AUC and Cmax values for desloratadine and 3-OH desloratadine were higher in females (3-10% and 45-48%, respectively) compared with males. Mean AUC and Cmax for desloratadine were higher in Black compared with Caucasian subjects (18-32%), while mean AUC and Cmax values for 3-OH-desloratadine were lower (10%). Therefore, no dose adjustment is needed for race or gender.</p><p>Protein binding to human plasma protein ranges from 83 to 87%.</p><p>Studies in special populations <ref type="bibr">(C98-354, P00272, C98-335)</ref> In study C98-354 the pharmacokinetics of desloratadine was investigated in subjects with normal liver function (n=8) as compared to patients with various degrees of stable chronic liver disease (n=12).</p><p>The study showed that patients with hepatic dysfunction had mean AUC and Cmax values that were up to 2.3 and 2.4 times greater, respectively, than healthy subjects and that a single-dose of desloratadine 7.5 mg administered to subjects with various degrees of hepatic dysfunction was safe and well tolerated.</p><p>In response to the List of Questions interim results were submitted from a multiple dose study (P00272) in subjects with hepatic impairment. The study is a Phase I, open label, multiple dose, parallel group study comparing the pharmacokinetics of desloratadine and 3-OH-desloratadine. The interim results include 20 subjects (10 men, 10 women, 40-66 years, 9 healthy and 11 with moderate hepatic impairment. Normal metabolisers with moderate hepatic impairment could experience a 3-fold increase in the desloratadine exposure (median AUC). However, no apparent difference between the exposure to desloratadine in slow metabolisers with and without hepatic impairment was seen. Given that the increase in median exposure between normal and poor metabolisers is 6-fold and that there is no major differences in the safety profile for poor and normal metabolisers a dose reduction is therefore not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment.</p><p>The safety profile of desloratadine in patients with renal insufficiency was studied in a Phase I, single dose study (C98-335), for which the report was submitted as part of the answers to the List of Questions. The study included 37 subjects (12 healthy subjects, 25 patients with chronic renal insufficiency, 26 men and 11 women, 26-70 years). Patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, who were normal metabolisers has a 1.5-2.5 fold increase in AUC for desloratadine and minimal changes in 3-OH-desloratadine concentrations. Therefore a warning concerning the use in patients with renal impairment is recommended. This is reflected in the SPC (see section 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use).</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of desloratadine were evaluated in 17 subjects &gt; 65 years of age who participated in a multiple dose (5 mg, o.d. x 10 days) study. The mean AUC and Cmax were 20% greater than in subjects &lt; 65 years old. The mean plasma elimination t½ was prolonged by approximately 30% (33.7 hours). Based on these results dose adjustment in the elderly is not warranted.</p><p>Interaction studies (C98-352, C98-353, P01380, P01378, P01868)</p><p>No clinically relevant changes in desloratadine plasma concentrations were observed in the ketoconazole and erythromycin interaction studies.</p><p>The enzyme(s) as well as the tissue site(s) responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine to its primary metabolite 3-OH-desloratadine has not yet been identified. However, it is anticipated that the potential for PK interactions of desloratadine with classical CYP450 inducers and inhibitors is low, as the metabolism does not appear to be mediated by a known cytochrome P450 enzyme. The inhibition spectra of desloratadine was evaluated using five cytochrome P450 enzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6 in human liver microsomes. Desloratadine and 3-OH desloratadine did not significantly inhibit any of the five enzymes. This property and that desloratadine is not a substrate or an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein was included in the SPC in Section 5.2 through a Type II variation.</p><p>The drug interaction potential of slow metabolisers is considered to be low, because neither desloratadine nor 3-OH-desloratadine inhibits known CYP450 enzymes and because any drug or xenobiotic that inhibits the metabolism of desloratadine to 3-OH-desloratadine would be unimportant since the enzyme is impaired in "slow" metabolisers. Also the safety profile of the subjects identified as "slow" metabolisers in the ketoconazole (n=8) and erythromycin (n=1) interaction studies were not different from the normal metabolisers in the studies.</p><p>Study P01380 evaluated the effect of grapefruit juice on desloratadine and fexofenadine (FX) pharmacokinetics. 19 of the 24 subjects were Hispanic (from the Miami area). The bioavailability of DL, measured in terms of plasma DL and 3-OH DL levels, was unaltered, while FX Cmax and AUC were reduced by ∼ 30 % in the presence of grapefruit juice.</p><p>The effects of grapefruit juice are not limited only to inhibition of CYP3A4, but also involve transport mediated uptake and efflux absorption processes, namely OATP and P-gp.</p><p>Given the potential importance of these transport processes as discussed in the 'Note for Guidance on Drug Interactions', the information that desloratadine has a low potential for interactions at the absorption site was added to section 4.5 of the SPC through a Type II variation.</p><p>The results of two separate controlled, parallel-group clinical pharmacology studies (P01378, P01868), characterising the effects of Fluoxetine and Cimetidine on the pharmacokinetics of desloratadine were submitted in a Type II application. The results showed that CYP2D6 does not play a major role in the metabolism of desloratadine. This is consistent with results from the in vitro inhibition studies that predicted that desloratadine would not produce any clinically relevant inhibition of CYP2D6. The use of fluoxetine was questioned, as fluoxetine itself is a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor. In the response the MAH pointed to two in vitro studies submitted in the original Marketing Authorisation application for desloratadine film-coated tablets. These two studies were carried out using two validated probe substances (bufuralol and dextrometorphan) and indicated that high concentrations of desloratadine did not inhibit CYP2D6. That desloratadine administration does not affect fluoxetine metabolism in vivo supports the conclusion that clinically relevant inhibition of CYP2D6 is not expected in the recommended daily dose of 5 mg desloratadine. The information on interactions in section 5.2 in the tablet SPC was slightly altered following the Type II variation to state that desloratadine does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo, and in vitro studies have shown that the drug does not inhibit CYP2D6. Identical wording was later introduced in the SPC of the syrup and oral lyophilisate following a Type II variation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dose-response studies and main clinical studies</head><p>The clinical efficacy and safety studies were conducted according to GCP. The design, dose, duration, the number of patients and the demographic characteristics of these patients are given below: The symptoms evaluated in the Phase II and III studies were nasal symptoms: rhinorrhea, nasal stuffiness/congestion, nasal itching, sneezing; and non-nasal symptoms: itching/burning eyes, tearing/watering eyes, redness of eyes and itching of ears and palate. In addition, cough was assessed in studies C98-223, C98-224 and C98-225. In all studies the symptoms were assessed using a 4 point verbal rating scale from 0 to 3, with 0 being no symptoms and 3 being severe symptoms.</p><p>The symptom scores were collected twice daily, in both a reflective (how the patient has been feeling the preceding 12 hours), and instantaneous or now (how the subject was feeling at the time of assessment) fashion. The former method of data collection provided information on how effective the treatment had been throughout the day, whereas the latter provided information on the efficacy at the end of the entire dosing interval (24 hours). The scores from the eight/nine symptoms were summed up to a total score.</p><p>Primary efficacy endpoint was the 2-week average change from baseline of the subjects' total reflective symptom scores. In the onset of action studies the primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in total symptom score and the time to onset defined as the first time point that desloratadine was statistically superior to placebo and remained so thereafter.</p><p>Secondary endpoints were: total nasal, total non-nasal and individual symptom scores, overall condition of SAR and therapeutic responses.</p><p>The overall condition of SAR was evaluated jointly by the investigator/designee and the subject at baseline and all subsequent visits according to the scale below. The score was based on the entire time interval since the last visit, and graded as for severity of signs and symptoms on a four point verbal rating scale from 0 to 3, where 0 is no symptom evident and 3 being severe symptoms.</p><p>The subject and physician/designee evaluated the therapeutic response jointly at each visit after baseline on a 5 point verbal rating scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being complete relief and 5 being treatment failure.</p><p>In addition, quality of life (QOL) was measured in studies C98-223, C98-224 and C98-225. The QOL variables included the 8 SF-36 scales, the 2-component summary scores of the SF-36, and the 8 scales of the rhinoconjunctivitis QOL questionnaire. Additionally, an overall rhinoconjunctivitis score was calculated as an average of all items. Both the SF-36 and rhinoconjunctivitis-specific HQOL used the past week as the reference period for assessment.</p><p>Major exclusion criteria in the trials included asthma (requiring chronic use of inhaled or systemic steroids), current history of frequent, clinically significant sinusitis or chronic purulent postnasal drip, rhinitis medicamentosa, upper respiratory tract or sinus infection that required antibiotic therapy within 14 days prior to screening, or viral upper respiratory infection within 7 days prior to screening, nasal structural abnormalities (large nasal polyps, marked septal deviation) that significantly interfere with nasal air flow and dependency upon nasal, oral or ocular decongestants, nasal topical antihistamines, or nasal steroids.</p><p>The Intent-to-treat (ITT) population was defined as all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of study medication and had both baseline and some post-baseline data. All analysis were performed on this population. The Efficacy-Evaluable population was defined as randomised subjects who had no key protocol violations. Confirmatory efficacy analyses on the primary variable were based on this subset of subjects. Assessment of the subjects' evaluability was done prior to unblinding the treatment code.</p><p>In the four multiple dose SAR studies the primary efficacy analysis was analysed as per the study protocols using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Statistical analyses were also performed based on pooled data from the four multiple dose SAR studies. The pooled analyses employed two mixed effects models performed on the pooled 2 week average reflective total symptom score.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">20/60  EMEA 2004</formula><p>Dose-response study (C98-001):</p><p>From the preclinical data it is anticipated that the human dose of desloratadine may be equal to ¼ to ½ that of loratadine, and its effect may persist for 24 hours. Therefore, the applicant has chosen to perform its clinical program starting with a placebo controlled dose-finding study with a dose of desloratadine ranging from 2.5 up to 20 mg.</p><p>Based on the results of symptom scores and assessment of overall condition of SAR and response to therapy, all of the desloratadine doses except for the 2.5 mg dose were all more effective than placebo in the relief of SAR signs and symptoms. At almost none of the time points did desloratadine 5 mg o.d. statistically improve the overall condition of SAR as compared to placebo (at endpoint day 15 p=0.13, mean change from baseline -24.9% versus -19.6%).</p><p>Joint subject-physician evaluation of the therapeutic response results showed that desloratadine 5 mg o.d. was not statistically significantly superior to placebo, especially at the later visits.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pooled efficacy data</head><p>To better characterise the effects of desloratadine and to better characterise treatment effects in subgroups of patients a statistical analysis was performed based on pooled data from the 4 major clinical trials. Pooling of data from these studies is appropriate as they had approximately the same number of patients and similar study design. One difference was that cough was not assessed in study C98-001. Statistical analyses of studies C98-223, C98-224 and C98-225 did not show a difference in results whether including or excluding cough from the total symptom score. Consequently efficacy analyses of the pooled data were based on the change from baseline in total reflective symptom score excluding cough. The statistical analyses employed two mixed-effects models. Model #1 extracted effects for study, treatment and study-by-treatment interactions, with study and study-by-treatment being random and treatment being fixed. Model #2 was used to study the effects of co-variates. Model #2 extracted effects for study, treatment, sex, race, sex-by-treatment, race-by-treatment and study-bytreatment interaction. Study and study-by-treatment being random and the other effects fixed.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">22/60  EMEA 2004</formula><p>The pooled analyses (Model #1) for the primary efficacy variable is given below. For total symptoms from patient diaries during the first 2 weeks of treatment, pooled data showed a mean symptom reduction with desloratadine 5 mg of 27.7% versus a placebo reduction of 19.4% (p=0.02). The mixed-effects model #1 confirmed that the symptom reduction seen following 5 mg was not different from the one seen following 7.5 mg.</p><p>Pooled data for secondary efficacy analysis showed similar reductions as those observed with the total symptoms data. Total instantaneous/now symptom scores at the end of the dosing interval showed a reduction of 24.3%, 25.3% and 17.7% for desloratadine 5 mg, desloratadine 7.5 mg and placebo, respectively. Similar improvements were observed in total nasal, total non-nasal and individual symptoms, as well as in physician and patient evaluation of therapeutic response and assessment of overall disease condition.</p><p>HQOL analysis in studies C98-223, C98-224 and C98-225 indicated that SAR produced a mild burden of disease. Improvements in subject-physician evaluations of clinical response to treatment were associated with improvements in HQOL.</p><p>Results from model #2 indicated a strong effect in favour of desloratadine (combined 5 and 7.5 mg dose groups) over placebo (p=0.003), and that there was no significant sex-by-treatment (p=0.30) or race-by-treatment (p=0.78) interactions.</p><p>An evaluation of the effect of age group on the treatment effect based on the pooled data was submitted in response to the List of Questions. Results showed that in the age group 12-18 years the clinical effect of desloratadine (pooled analysis 5 and 7.5 mg) shows only a numerical trend in favour of desloratadine but the sample size in this age group is not sufficient to demonstrate statistical significance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study C98-226</head><p>The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the onset of action of 5 mg desloratadine compared to placebo in the treatment of SAR exposed to pollen in an outdoor setting (July -September 1998). The placebo group in this setting had an unexpectedly high response with a reduction in total symptom score by 46% over the 5 hour study period compared to 51% reduction following 5 mg desloratadine. As there was no statistical difference between the active and placebo groups, the onset of effect could not be evaluated in this study.</p></div>

Almost the same observations were done for the secondary efficacy parameters (e.g., subject evaluated total nasal symptom score, subject evaluated total non-nasal symptom score). Efficacy of the 5 mg dose occurred at 2h30 up to 3 h whilst efficacy of the 7.5 mg dose occurred at 1 to 1h30 later.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion on efficacy</head><p>The data provided support the claim that doses of 5 mg or 7.5 mg are effective in reducing symptoms of Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis as compared to placebo. The claim is backed by the pattern of responses in the four multiple-dose, double-blind, placebo controlled and parallel group trials. The results are corroborated by a pooled analysis of the four trials, which showed desloratadine 5 and 7.5 mg to be superior to placebo and the effect of the two desloratadine doses not to be significantly different.</p><p>In the dose-ranging study the reduction of symptom scores was restricted to 28% from baseline. The limited reduction in symptom scores is also seen in the other three multidose trials. The mean change following desloratadine 5 and 7.5 mg might be statistically significantly higher than following placebo, but the numerical difference is small. In response to the List of Questions concerning the magnitude of effect of desloratadine the applicant explained that the mean change from baseline in the primary efficacy parameter of Total Symptom Score was relatively consistent across the 4 clinical efficacy trials, ranging from -4.2 (-24.6%) to -5.1 (-30.2%) units. On the other hand, the mean change from baseline in Total Symptom Score for the placebo group was more variable, ranging from -2.5 (-12.5%) to -3.9 (-21.7%). The variability and magnitude of the placebo response is difficult to explain, although it is likely due to variability in regional pollen counts.</p><p>To confirm that the magnitude of improvement in SAR symptoms observed is consistent with the expected response for an antihistamine in this disease state, the applicant compared the differences (delta) in mean reduction in symptom scores between desloratadine and placebo with those reported in recent publications for other antihistamines. The magnitude of the clinical effect following administration of 5.0 mg desloratadine was seen to be comparable to that published for other antihistamines that are currently used in medical practice. However, it seems from the percentage of improvement in Total Symptom Score that the clinical efficacy of 5 mg desloratadine is probably not superior to 10 mg loratadine.</p><p>The applicant had received scientific advice on the duration of the clinical studies from the CPMP in 1998, stating that in general, studies testing the efficacy of a medicinal product in SAR last 2 to 12 weeks, with duration of 4 to 6 weeks in most of the studies. The applicant was therefore asked to</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">24/60  EMEA 2004</formula><p>explain the duration of 2-4 weeks studies with desloratadine. The applicant explained that the available patient population is actually not reliably symptomatic (for the purposes of an efficacy clinical trial) for more than 2-4 weeks. This is due to the variable duration of the pollen season and the variability in the onset of at least moderate symptoms in individual SAR patients. For a valid efficacy comparison vs. placebo, it is important to assure that the patients have the opportunity to exhibit significant SAR symptoms throughout the duration of the study. In addition, a review of the literature was conducted through a Medline search from 1985-1999. The search conditions were studies of SAR in which efficacy was assessed in subjects over 12 years of age, using only oral antihistamines, in a double-blind, placebo controlled fashion. This search yielded 26 publications, out of which 5 had a duration of 28 days or more. In the publications reporting studies over 2 weeks in duration, the efficacy of placebo increases over time, leading to a progressive decrease in the difference between the active treatment and the placebo groups. This increase in placebo response may be due to varying pollen counts over time. Therefore, with longer study duration, the likelihood increases that study subjects on placebo groups (as well as those receiving desloratadine) will experience a significant amount of days without being exposed to the pollen that triggers their symptoms. Furthermore subjects were required in all studies to be experiencing moderate to severe symptoms at study screening and baseline. This likely led to subjects being enrolled at the peak of their exposure to the pollen they were sensitised to. This peak will not last for 4 weeks. Therefore, subjects in the placebo groups (as well as those receiving desloratadine) were very likely exposed to a progressively decreasing amount of pollen throughout the study. This was considered to be an acceptable explanation for the short duration of the clinical trials.</p><p>In the List of Questions the applicant was asked to explain the influence of the seasons the studies were conducted in and the possible influence of mould spores. C98-001 was conducted in the spring season in the US, whereas C98223, C98-224 and C98225 had been conducted in the autumn season in US. In the spring tree pollens are followed in the early summer by grass pollen, which is similar to Europe. In the autumn the trees and grasses also pollinate in the southern states of the US, in other areas ragweed and other weed pollens are present. This autumn pollination pattern is also similar to that of many areas in Europe, where mugwort and ragweed are the major autumn pollen allergens. The pollen counts between C98-001 and C98-223, C98-224 and C98-225 were different, as these studies were conducted in different seasons. The mould levels in both seasons, though, were similar. However, the presence of mould and/or other inhaled allergens in patients screened for the study was neither an inclusion nor an exclusion parameter assessed in these trials. The subjects enrolled in C98001/223/224/225 were required at entry to be actively symptomatic, and to be allergic to an allergen that was pollinating at the time of the study (either tree, grass or weed pollen).</p><p>There are data in the literature showing that the mechanism of action and symptoms of SAR are similar whether patients are sensitised to grass/tree or to ragweed pollens. Therefore, treatment of SAR during the spring or autumn should lead to similar conclusions with regards to the efficacy and safety of a compound. Furthermore the data provided in the response to the List of Questions showed that there was no direct correlation observed between pollen counts and symptom severity in the four studies.</p><p>The three onset of action studies utilising controlled-exposure chambers showed that the subjects first became aware of significant improvement in their SAR symptoms as early as 1 hour 15 minutes and up to 2 hours following desloratadine 5 mg. Both studies that evaluated desloratadine 7.5 mg determined the onset of action as 3 hours 30 minutes. The reason why the 7.5 mg dose had an apparently longer onset of action than the 5.0 mg dose is not clear.</p><p>As part of the List of Questions the applicant submitted the results of a study conducted in the Vienna Challenge Chamber (VCC) assessed the onset of action of desloratadine 5 mg in 28 subjects allergic to grass pollen. The study employed an open-label, noncomparative design in which subjects received a single dose of desloratadine 5 mg during exposure to grass pollen in the VCC. Onset of action was defined, as the first time point at which there was at least a 25% reduction from baseline in the Total Symptom Score. On the basis of this definition, the median time to onset was 48.5 minutes, with a 95% confidence interval of (38.0, 59.0). Although this was an open-label study, the results obtained are consistent with the 75-minute onset time obtained in I98-448, which was also conducted in the VCC. In conclusion, the onset of action for desloratadine has been demonstrated to occur from 1 to 2 hours after administration.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">25/60  EMEA 2004</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical efficacy in Allergic Rhinitis (AR)</head><p>The clinical program to justify the efficacy and safety of 5 mg desloratadine tablets in subjects with AR included the SAR studies submitted in the initial Marketing Authorisation Application, two studies in patients with SAR and concomitant asthma and two studies in patients with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis. A total of 4,797 subjects were evaluated in these studies, of which 1,655 subjects were treated with 5 mg desloratadine once daily.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Studies Conducted With Desloratadine</head><p>The desloratadine clinical program was designed and conducted in accordance with relevant Good Clinical Practice and ICH guidelines regarding study conduct, record keeping, data collection and regulatory submission and under the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki <ref type="bibr">(1996)</ref>.</p><p>Subjects were required to have at least a two-year history of AR. They were also required to have had a positive skin test (prick or intradermal) response to an appropriate allergen within the 12 months prior to Screening. Subjects in all studies were to be clinically symptomatic at the Screening visit. Demographics at Baseline were similar across treatment groups. The subject population in this clinical program was generally representative of the overall demographics of allergy patients. Most subjects were between the ages of 18 and 64 years (87% in each treatment group) and Caucasian (&gt;78%); 66% of subjects in each treatment group were female.</p><p>In the MAH's response to the Request for Supplementary Information it was clarified that subjects at baseline were required to have a minimum average score in the mild to moderate range (11 (SAR) and 10 (PAR) out of 24 points). The subjects included did, however, have a higher mean baseline score (12.6-16.8 out of 24 points) corresponding to 36.2% having moderate to severe symptoms. The mean change in total symptoms score from baseline was analysed separately for the subgroups of patients with baseline total symptom score in the upper third of the severity scale. The treatment differences for these subgroups were representative of the results for all patients. It is therefore acceptable that the use of desloratadine is not restricted to subjects with mild to moderate allergic rhinitis.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">26/60  EMEA 2004</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Justification of Dosage Regimen</head><p>The justification for a DL 5 mg once daily dose selection in the treatment of SAR was summarised in the initial SAR Marketing Authorisation application. The DL 5 mg dose is justified for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, based on the significant overlap between SAR and PAR and the demonstration of equivalent exposure between DL 5 mg and loratadine 10 mg (as described in the SAR MAA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Endpoints</head><p>Efficacy results of the prespecified, protocol-defined primary and secondary efficacy variables from the eight studies are summarised separately. Slight differences between the SAR and PAR studies preclude an appropriate pooling of the primary endpoints. However, a pooled analysis of the six SAR and two PAR studies was carried out using a sum of the four common nasal symptoms (nasal discharge, nasal itching, sneezing, and congestion). The purpose of this additional analysis was to derive an overall estimate of the treatment effect.</p><p>Subjects self-evaluated their PAR and SAR symptoms twice each day (am, before dosing, and approximately 12 hours later in the pm) with both reflective (prior 12 hours) and instantaneous (now) scores. The symptoms of PAR and SAR were assessed daily by the subjects, and recorded in their diaries using a four-point scale: none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), and severe <ref type="formula">(3)</ref>.</p><p>The primary efficacy variable for SAR and the primary time point in the SAR studies is defined in the section 'Clinical efficacy in seasonal allergic rhinitis'.</p><p>The primary efficacy variable for PAR (P00218 and P00219) was the average am/pm instantaneous (now) total symptom score, excluding congestion.</p><p>· Nasal: nasal discharge, postnasal drip, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing. · Non-Nasal: itching/burning eyes, tearing/watering eyes, and itching of ears/palate. The primary time point was the change from Baseline in average score over four weeks. Although patients in the PAR studies rated nasal congestion severity twice daily along with the seven other symptoms, the nasal congestion symptom score was not included in the primary endpoint. This consideration was based on the allowance of pseudoephedrine rescue medication in these studies and guidance issued from the FDA on clinical development programs for drug products in allergic rhinitis.</p><p>The instantaneous evaluation of symptoms was chosen as the basis for the primary endpoint because PAR symptoms are generally understood to be subtler compared to SAR, and it was felt the instantaneous symptom score would more accurately capture treatment effect. Clinical considerations served as the basis to evaluate rhinorrhea by capturing symptoms scores on both anterior and posterior nasal discharge (nasal discharge and postnasal drip, respectively). The decision not to evaluate the non-nasal symptom of eye redness was also based on clinical consideration since eye redness is less pronounced in PAR compared to SAR.</p><p>Allergic rhinitis, by precise definition, refers only too nasal symptoms. However, the term is commonly used to include both nasal and non-nasal symptoms, even though the non-nasal symptoms are less pronounced in PAR.</p><p>In all AR studies, the secondary variables included change from Baseline in total nasal, total nonnasal, and individual symptom scores for the 12-hour prior and now average am/pm assessments, as well as at the separate am and pm time points. For all studies, global variables included the Overall Condition of Disease expressed as a change from Baseline, and an Evaluation of Therapeutic Response, expressed as a raw score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Evaluation</head><p>The primary variable at the designated time point (Days 1-15 or Days 1-29) was analysed for each study using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) that extracted sources of variation due to treatment and centre. All pair-wise comparisons were made at the two-sided 5% level of significance using the least squares means from the ANOVA. No adjustments for multiple comparisons were made in the four SAR studies because the test for statistical significance was performed using a dose-trend test. In the SAR/Asthma studies, no adjustments for multiple comparisons were made because a stepwise procedure was employed.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">27/60  EMEA 2004</formula><p>For all studies included in this dossier, efficacy results was presented for only the 5-mg DL vs. placebo comparisons.</p><p>All analyses of efficacy were based on all randomised subjects who had Baseline and some postbaseline efficacy data for a given efficacy variable (Intent-To-Treat principle).</p><p>A pooled analysis of the six SAR and two PAR studies was carried out using the four common nasal symptoms (nasal discharge, nasal itching, sneezing, and congestion) evaluated across all eight studies referred to as the Common Total Nasal Symptom Score. The sum of common nasal symptom scores was analysed for the mean of the first two weeks for all eight studies, and the mean of four weeks for the five studies with four weeks of data (Studies C98-225, P00214, P00215, P00218 and P00219).</p><p>A mixed-effect model was used to derive an overall estimate of treatment effect including treatment as a fixed effect and study as a random effect.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results Primary Efficacy Endpoint</head><p>The results of the primary efficacy variable for the PAR studies (i.e., change in average am/pm now total symptoms score excluding congestion) from all eight studies are summarised in the table below. Overall, the 5-mg DL dose was superior to placebo with respect to Days 1-15 average am/pm now symptom assessments in 6 of 8 studies (SAR Studies: C98-001, C98-223, C98-224, P00214, P00215 and PAR Study P00218). Reduction in Days 1-15 am/pm now total symptom score (average, excluding congestion) was significantly (p&lt;0.04) greater in the 5-mg DL group vs. placebo. A numerical advantage over placebo was found for the 5-mg DL group in SAR Study C98-225. No numerical advantage was observed in PAR Study P00219. Across all studies, total symptom reductions averaged 24.5%-32% in the 5-mg DL groups compared with 12%-26% in the placebo groups.</p><p>In 3 of 5 four-week studies (P00218, P00214 and P00215), reductions in Days 1-29 am/pm now total symptom score (average, excluding congestion) were significantly greater (p&lt;0.04) in the 5-mg DL group vs. placebo.</p><p>Analyses of am/pm now total symptoms score results including congestion produced results similar to those shown in the table above.</p><p>Confirmatory analyses of the am/pm prior total symptom scores excluding and including congestion was performed for all studies. The results were consistent with those presented above in the In summary, results of Days 1-15 average am/pm prior total symptom score analyses were consistent with those of the Days 1-15 average am/pm now symptom assessments. The results showed that the 5mg DL dose was statistically superior to placebo for reduction in allergic rhinitis symptoms in 6 of 8 AR studies. These conclusions were not changed whether or not congestion was included as a symptom.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results of pooled analysis</head><p>To measure the treatment effect of DL across the allergic rhinitis studies, a pooled efficacy analysis of the Common Total Nasal Symptom Score (sum of nasal discharge, nasal itch, sneezing, and congestion) for the 12-hour prior and now average am/pm assessments was performed. The results are shown in the tables below. relatively small treatment effects. Overall, greater treatment effects are shown in the four-week studies at the two-week endpoint compared to the four-week endpoint.</p><p>The am/pm prior Common Total Nasal Symptom Scores show a statistically significant improvement for DL compared to placebo over both the two-week and four-week treatment periods. Similarly, the pooled analysis of am/pm now Common Total Nasal Symptom Scores from the eight studies show a statistically significant improvement for DL compared to placebo over the two-week treatment period and numerical improvement over the four week treatment period. The estimates of the treatment difference at both time-points support the overall efficacy of DL compared to placebo (15% to 27% of the placebo mean change from baseline). These pooled analyses confirm and support the results of the individual studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results Secondary Efficacy Endpoints</head><p>Among the secondary efficacy measurements, am now total symptom score provides evidence of therapeutic effect at the end of the dosing interval. This is clinically relevant because nasal symptoms tend to be most troublesome in the early morning hours for many allergic rhinitis patients. Results are summarised below. The am now total symptom score analyses indicated that 5 mg DL was superior to placebo for symptom reduction 24 hours after dosing. Significant reductions of symptoms were observed in 6 of 8 AR studies. Improvement of symptoms was seen over both the two-week and four-week treatment periods. Corresponding results for total symptom score including congestion were consistent with results for am now total symptom score excluding congestion.</p><p>In summary, efficacy is maintained for the full 24-hour dosing interval using once-a-day dosing.</p><p>In all studies, results of additional AR variables, including assessment of total nasal, total non-nasal, and individual symptom scores were consistent with am/pm now and prior total symptom score results.</p><p>The investigator and subject jointly evaluated the Overall Condition of AR.

In all eight studies, DL was numerically more effective than placebo for improvement in Overall Condition of AR at the endpoint of each study.</p><p>The investigator and subject also jointly evaluated Therapeutic Response at each post-baseline visit by comparing the current severity of disease symptoms to Baseline. Response was recorded on a scale of 1 (complete relief) to 5 (treatment failure). In all eight studies, DL was numerically more effective than placebo for positive response to therapy. Significant improvements compared with placebo (p&lt;0.05) were seen in the DL 5-mg groups of SAR Studies C98-001, C98-224, and PAR Studies P00218 and P00219.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion on clinical studies</head><p>In two out of five four week studies the effect of desloratadine was not superior to that of placebo measured by days 1-29 am/pm total symptom score (average excluding nasal congestion) and the treatment effects shown in the four week studies were greater at the two week endpoint than at the four week endpoint. In their response to the Request for Supplementary Information regarding a maintained effect over four weeks the MAH responded that efficacy evaluated by standard methodology of twice daily symptom assessment captured in diaries is most clearly seen at the early timepoints and that difficulty in consistently demonstrating efficacy in clinical studies in AR has been acknowledged in FDA guidance and in the ICH E10 document. Furthermore, in the three out of five studies in which desloratadine showed efficacy superior to placebo the reduction in total symptom score from baseline increased for each successive week of treatment, however, increases were also seen for the placebo treated patients, whereby the difference was diminished.</p><p>The CPMP questioned the clinical relevance of the findings as the therapeutic benefit (verum minus placebo) is limited especially days 16-29. In response the MAH submitted the findings of a responder analysis for nasal symptoms with a clinically meaningful improvement in response to desloratadine defined as a 25% or greater improvement in common total nasal symptoms score. Although a significant higher number of responders was found in the verum group, this was a pooled analysis of the SAR and PAR studies and the MAH was requested in a Follow-On Request for Supplementary Information to give the pooled analysis mean change from baseline in average am/pm now common total nasal symptom score for the PAR studies alone.</p><p>The MAH submitted the results of the pooled analysis of mean change from baseline in average Common Nasal Symptom Score am/pm now from the Perennial Allergic Rhinitis studies (P00218 and P00219), which are shown below. The reduction in average am/pm now Common Nasal Symptom Score seen with desloratadine was superior to that of placebo at both the 2 and 4 week endpoints (delta=0.249 and 0.202 and p=0.009 and 0.044, respectively).</p><p>The MAH carried out a responder analysis using the same definition as in their responses to the Request for Supplementary information (i.e. a clinically meaningful improvement in response to desloratadine was a 25% or greater improvement in common total nasal symptoms score).</p><p>The percentage of patients with ≥25% improvement was significantly larger for desloratadine treated patients compared to placebo at both 2 and 4 week endpoints (p=0.012 and p=0.018 respectively, based on the Cochran-Mantel Haenzel statistic, with corrects for study effect). Over half of the desloratadine patients experienced a ≥25% improvement at the 2 and 4 week endpoints (50.7% and 56.8%, respectively).</p><p>PAR is primarily a disorder manifested by chronic nasal symptoms (i.e nasal discharge, itching, sneezing and congestion). Thus, relief of troublesome nasal symptoms is of utmost importance to PAR sufferers. More than 50% of the desloratadine treated patients experienced a clinically meaningful and a statistically significant reduction in nasal symptoms over the 4 week study duration when compared to placebo.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion on clinical studies</head><p>The primary efficacy analyses of am/pm prior and am/pm now total symptom score demonstrated that DL 5 mg was superior to placebo for reduction in symptoms of AR in 6 of 8 studies (5 in SAR and 1 in PAR), including the two studies conducted in subjects with SAR and concurrent asthma. The results of the pooled analysis of the common nasal symptoms and the secondary efficacy variables are consistent with the results of the primary parameter. The results of the pooled PAR studies showed a reduction in the average am/pm now Common Total Nasal Symptom Score seen with desloratadine was superior to that of placebo at both week 2 and 4 and that more than 50% of the desloratadine treated patients experienced a clinically meaningful and a statistically significant reduction in nasal symptoms over the 4 week study duration when compared to placebo.</p></div>

CPMP considered it acceptable based on the bioequivalence between the film-coated tablet and the syrup formulation and between the film-coated tablet and the oral lyophilisate. The allergic rhinitis indication was considered also to be applicable to the desloratadine 0.5 mg/ml syrup for adults and adolescents and the desloratadine 5 mg oral lyophilisate, as it will be administered using the same dosage as the film-coated tablets presentation and for the oral lyophilisate also to the same population.</p><p>The desloratadine 0.5 mg/ml syrup is also indicated for seasonal allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria in children (2 years of age or over). As perennial rhinitis is a disease of childhood and the nature and course of allergic rhinitis as well as the activity of antihistamines are similar in children and adults, the CPMP considered the new extended indication allergic rhinitis to be acceptable also in the age range 2 to 12 years old. </p></div>

The reduction in pruritus scores (at the end of the study) were 58.4% and 67.5%, respectively, for the desloratadine treated subjects versus 40.4% and 33.5%, respectively, for the placebo treated subjects. There is evidence that patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria can be divided into 2 groups: those who do respond to antihistamines (approximately 85%) and those that are relatively resistant to antihistamines. These latter patients frequently require the addition of other drugs. Patients that were refractory to antihistamines were excluded from the two studies. This is reflected in the SPC section 5.1.</p><p>In the two clinical studies a total of 22 subjects was in the age range 12 to 17 years and 17 subjects were ≥65 years of age. Of these 13 adolescents and 8 geriatric subjects received desloratadine 5 mg. The results for these two groups and the age group 18-64 is given below. Neither the numerically higher difference seen in the adolescents or the numerically lower difference seen in the ≥65 years group are clinically different from the effect seen in the 18 to 64 years population. The estimates of the treatment differences in these subgroups could be attributed to less than reliable estimates in the smaller sample sizes. As a result statistical inferential analysis was not performed for these subgroups. From the results observed in the CIU trials it can be concluded that the adolescent and geriatric patients treated for CIU should receive the same benefit from desloratadine 5 mg as subjects 18-64 years of age.</p></div>

Study P01216 compared the bioequivalence of the 5 mg DL tablet, 5 mg DL oral lyophilisate tablet and a 5 mg dose of the DL syrup. Study P01419 evaluated the effects of food and water administration on the bioavailability of DL and 3-OH DL from the oral lyophilisate tablet formulation. Both studies evaluating relative bioavailability/bioequivalence employed a randomised, crossover and open-label design. The single-dose design used in both studies complies with the recommendations outlined in the European CPMP Guideline for Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence for this type of formulation. For these studies, the pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax and AUC) were subjected to statistical analysis using a crossover analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. The effects due to subject, period and treatment were extracted. Cmax and AUC values were log-transformed and the 90% confidence intervals (CI) for the mean difference between the treatments expressed as a percent of each treatment mean. The power to detect a 20% difference in treatment means for an αlevel of 0.05 (two-tailed) was calculated using the pooled residual error and associated degrees of freedom from the ANOVA. This study design in combination with these statistical tests, are considered to be the standard for evaluating bioequivalence.</p><p>Plasma concentrations were analysed for DL and 3-OH DL using a validated liquid chromatographicmass spectrometric method (LC/MS/MS) with a lower limit of quantitation of 0.025 ng/ml. All analyses of plasma samples were conducted at PPD-Richmond, VA. These methods have been validated for specificity, sensitivity, linearity and reproducibility.</p><p>Across the two studies, following administration of the oral lyophilisate 5 mg tablet, a DL Cmax value of approximately 2.0 ng/ml was achieved at a median Tmax ranging from 2-3 hours in a fasting state. Mean DL AUC(I) values for the oral lyophilisate formulation were approximately 40 ng⋅hr/ml. The mean Cmax for 3-OH DL was approximately 1.0 ng/ml achieved at a median Tmax which ranged from 4-6 hours. The mean AUC(I) values for 3-OH DL ranged from approximately 25-30 ng⋅hr/ml. These data were consistent with the data from the DL 5 mg tablet studies. The mean parameters for DL and 3-OH DL following administration of DL 5 mg oral lyophilisate and DL conventional tablets are summarized in the The bioequivalence of the DL oral lyophilisate formulation relative to the DL syrup and tablet formulation was evaluated to assess the interchangeability of these three formulations (P01216).

However, this slightly lower Cmax value under the fed condition is not clinically meaningful.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacokinetics</head><p>The bioequivalence of the desloratadine syrup formulation relative to the tablet was evaluated to assess the interchangeability of these 2 formulations. Bioequivalence in adults was demonstrated in Study P00213, which showed that oral administration of a 5.0 mg dose of desloratadine syrup (0.5 mg/ml) and a desloratadine 5.0 mg tablet were bioequivalent. According to the literature, rhinitis in children shares most of the clinical and therapeutic characteristics with rhinitis in adults. Therefore, in order to ensure that the same efficacy and safety is achieved in children as demonstrated with desloratadine in adults, the applicant evaluated the dose of desloratadine that would result in comparable desloratadine and 3-OH desloratadine exposure (AUC and C max ) in children. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters presented in the table below allow a comparison of the exposure across all studies in the syrup program.  There was a high degree of variability expressed as percent coefficient of variation (%CV) associated with AUC(tf) values. Contributing to the parameter variability was the presence of some patients who were slow metabolisers in these studies. Slow metabolisers were defined as subjects with AUC (tf) 3-OH desloratadine to desloratadine ratios of less then 10%. In Studies P00225, P00270, P01125, and P01126 there were 2-3 slow metabolisers in each study, and in Study C98-577 there were 4 slow metabolisers. A similar number of slow metabolisers have been reported in previous studies conducted with desloratadine tablets in adults. No subjects were considered to be a slow metaboliser in Study P00213.</p><p>Differences in t½ were observed between adults and children. The mean t ½ of paediatric subjects across studies following single dose administration of desloratadine ranged between 16.4 to 19.4 hours, compared with 21 (22) hours in adults (based on the same blood sampling scheme in adults as in paediatric subjects). The difference (8-22%) was considered to be pharmacokinetically unimportant. The primary pharmacokinetic parameter, total body clearance, which is reduced in paediatric subjects, resulted in the requirement to reduce the dose in order to provide the same exposure (Cmax, AUC) as in adults.</p><p>In response to the List of Questions regarding the shorter t ½ in children compared to adults the applicant argued that fewer blood samples had been taken in the paediatric studies compared to the adults. When t ½ was computed for adults in study P00213 based on the same blood-sampling scheme as used in paediatric subjects t ½ was 21 <ref type="formula">(22)</ref> hours. In study P01216 in which the syrup formulation was also studied in adults, a t ½ of 17.9 (20) hours was observed. These data show that DL t ½ of the same order of magnitude has been observed in children and adults.</p></div>

Since the comparisons are being made across studies and due to the presence of slow metabolisers in some studies, median AUC values as opposed to mean values were used to compare exposure across studies.</p><p>In subjects 2 to 5 and 6 to 11 years of age, a single 2.5 mg (P00225) and 5.0 mg (P00270) oral dose of desloratadine, respectively, resulted in median desloratadine and 3-OH desloratadine AUC (tf) values that were approximately 2-fold the desloratadine and 3-OH desloratadine exposure observed in adults (P00213) following a 5.0 mg desloratadine dose.</p><p>However, a 1.25 mg (P01125) and 2.5 mg (P01126) dose of desloratadine in subjects 2 to 5 and 6 to 11 years of age, respectively, resulted in median desloratadine and 3-OH desloratadine AUC(tf) values that were comparable to the exposure of desloratadine and 3-OH desloratadine observed in adults (P00213) following a 5.0 mg desloratadine dose.</p><p>Consistent with AUC(tf) results, desloratadine and 3-OH desloratadine Cmax values in subjects aged 2 to 5 years and 6 to 12 years, following a 2.5 mg and 5.0 mg dose of desloratadine syrup were increased in comparison to adults receiving a 5.0 mg desloratadine dose. Following administration of half the initial dose, Cmax values in each age group were comparable to those observed in adults receiving a 5.0 mg dose of desloratadine.</p><p>In response to the List of Questions regarding the lower AUC in children compared to adults the applicant compared AUC(I), a measure of exposure, for children and adults. Because desloratadine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics in adults and is assumed to exhibit linear pharmacokinetics in children, AUC(I) is equivalent to AUC at steady state and is related to half-life as described below:</p><p>AUC (I) = (Dose x F/Vd) x 1.44 x t½ (where Vd/F = apparent volume of distribution, t½ = terminal phase half-life).</p><p>Differences between the AUC(I)s for the children (n=36) and adults (n=30) were evaluated by an unpaired t-test. There was no statistically significant difference (p=0.84) in the exposure between children and adults at their respective recommended doses.</p><p>In summary, a 1.25 mg and 2.5 mg dose of desloratadine syrup in paediatric subjects, aged 2 to 5 years and 6 to 11 years, respectively, provides desloratadine exposure comparable to the exposure observed in adults receiving desloratadine 5.0 mg tablets. The desloratadine 5.0 mg dose was proven efficacious in adult subjects with SAR and therefore paediatric subjects should have a therapeutic response at similar desloratadine exposure.</p><p>In addition, when median desloratadine exposure from loratadine syrup in children is compared to median desloratadine exposure from desloratadine syrup in the same age groups, these are shown to be comparable. This further supports the safety and efficacy of desloratadine syrup in children at the proposed dosage recommendations.</p><p>In the List of Outstanding Issues the CPMP questioned whether the doses proposed would result in sub-optimal efficacy in certain children. In response the MAH stated that on the basis of the clinical pharmacology studies conducted with DL syrup, it was determined that a 1.25 mg and 2.5 mg dose of DL in 2-5 and 6-11 year olds, respectively, matched the DL exposure produced by a 5 mg dose in adults. A 5 mg dose of DL syrup administered to adults results in a median AUC (0-72 hours) of 35.3. This is comparable to a median AUC (0-72 hours) of 38.7 in 2-5 year olds receiving 1.25 mg of DL syrup and a median AUC(0-72 hours) of 38.4 in 6-11 year olds receiving 2.5 mg of DL syrup.</p><p>A graphic summary of the median DL AUC (tf) determinations from relevant clinical pharmacology studies performed with DL and loratadine syrup in adult and paediatric subjects is presented in the figure below. </p></div>

The incidence of related TEAEs was also similar for DL and placebo within each allergic rhinitis subtype: SAR (DL 17% and placebo 13%), PAR (DL 11% and placebo 11%), and SAR/Asthma (DL 16% and placebo 14%).</p><p>In general, the overall incidence and pattern of adverse events in the pooled demographic subgroups (by age, race, and sex) were consistent with those observed in the overall study population. The overall incidences of treatment-related adverse events seen in the AR pool are consistent with pooled analysis of safety data from 10 studies of DL 5 mg (the eight studies included in the AR pool and two studies in chronic idiopathic urticaria). Data from the 10 clinical studies were pooled for completeness and to provide a common description of the adverse event profile in the labelling across indications. Therefore Section 4.8 of the SPC reflects the pooled overall frequency of adverse events for DL 5 mg from these 10 studies.</p><p>No respiratory safety issues were identified for DL. The overall occurrence of TEAEs associated with the respiratory system in the pooled allergic rhinitis studies was similar between DL 5 mg and placebo (12% and 9%, respectively). There were no respiratory system safety issues identified in subjects randomised in the two four-week studies in subjects with SAR and concurrent asthma (P00214 and P00215).</p><p>Approximately 11% of subjects (in Studies P00214 and P00215) in each treatment group reported TEAEs associated with the respiratory system. The numbers of subjects reporting treatment-related TEAEs was low (&lt;4%) and comparable between the DL-, placebo-and montelukast-treatment groups (3.5%, 2.6%, and 2.3%, respectively).</p></div>

One subject, treated with placebo, had a positive pregnancy test at the end of the study, and the third subject reported an anaphylactic reaction during the screening phase prior to randomisation. None of these events were considered to be related to the treatment.</p><p>Fatigue is the only treatment-related adverse event that was more frequently reported by the desloratadine treated subjects when compared to the placebo treated subjects (7 subjects vs. 1 subject). The apparent imbalance in this incidence was mostly a chance event occurring in a small number of subjects. Besides this, for the individual subject it might be difficult to discriminate between fatigue and somnolence. Interesting to note is that more subjects reported treatment related somnolence in the placebo group than in the desloratadine group (8 vs. 6 subjects). The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse event was headache, which occurred with a similar incidence in both treatment groups (12 subjects in the desloratadine treated group vs. eight in the placebo treated group).</p><p>All other treatment-related adverse events reported with desloratadine occurred to a similar extent with placebo. The severe treatment related adverse events occurred in &lt;1% in both treatment groups. In fact, only two subjects in each treatment group reported a severe treatment related adverse event.

Out of the 2469 subjects with both a baseline and an endpoint ECG, the investigators considered only 3 to have had a clinical meaningful abnormal ECG.</p><p>One patient treated with 5 mg desloratadine in C98-001 had a 7% increase in the QT c interval (431 msec at baseline, 465 msec at visit 5) and an increase in heart rate from 57 bpm at screening to 63 bpm at endpoint. The changes were not accompanied by any clinical symptoms or cardiovascular adverse events. The second subject treated with 5 mg desloratadine in study C98-001 had a septal infarction at screening, which was clinically significant at endpoint. It was subsequently determined that the abnormalities seen at endpoint were identical to the ones seen at screening. The third person (7.5 mg desloratadine group in C98-223) had a clinically meaningful abnormal ECG at both screening and endpoint with a QT c interval of 511msec at screening and 502 msec at endpoint. The patient was discontinued after 3 days treatment, as this was a protocol violation. No clinical symptoms apart from headache had been reported.</p><p>Mean percent changes in ECG interval data including ventricular rate, PR, QRS, QT and QT c interval were evaluated.

The frequency of other cardiovascular events was similar with the exception of tachycardia, which occurred in three DL-treated subjects and no placebotreated subjects. There were two reports of syncope in one placebo-treated subject and one montelukast-treated subject. No syncopal episodes occurred in DL-treated subjects. percent changes from Baseline did not suggest a pharmacological effect for DL.

This subject had an ECG that was normal at Baseline, but was considered abnormal and clinically significant at Endpoint. This subject had a QTc value of 394 msec at Baseline that was prolonged at Endpoint (520 msec based on the Fridericia formula). These QTc values were consistent with those calculated using the Bazett formula. Although the ECG was of poor quality, a manual reread confirmed the prolongation of QTc at Endpoint. The prolonged QTc interval was not considered by the investigator to be an adverse event. The subject had a history of fluid retention.</p></div>

The subject discontinued from the study due to a treatment failure. The ECGs at screening and at the final visit were normal and the medical history for cardiovascular disorders was negative. Two other subjects reported a mild hypertension as an adverse event (one in each treatment group); both were considered to be unrelated to the treatment by the investigators.</p><p>ECGs, including ventricular rate, PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals were evaluated at screening and endpoint (post-treatment).

One subject in the 10mg desloratadine group of study C98-001 and 1 subject in the 7.5mg desloratadine group of study C98-223. They had normal AST values at screening (18 U/L and 34 U/L, respectively) and elevated values at endpoint (159 U/L and 155 U/L). In the former it was thought to result from the intake of creatinine powder, the latter subject refused to return for a repeat laboratory evaluation.</p><p>Study C98-354 compared the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of desloratadine 7.5 mg in subjects with normal liver function to subjects with various degrees of stable chronic liver disease. Namely, Pugh's Modification of Child's classification score 5 to 6 (n=4), score 7 to 9 (n=4), and score 10 to 15 (n=4). Subjects with hepatic dysfunction had mean AUC and Cmax values of desloratadine that were up to 2.4 times greater, respectively, than healthy subjects. However, there was considerably overlap of the AUC values of the 4 groups. There were no significant differences in the t 1/2 among subjects with hepatic dysfunction to that in normal subjects. Overall, 10 of 20 subjects reported TEAEs. The most frequently reported, regardless of severity of hepatic dysfunction, were headache and abdominal pain. The majority of the TEAEs were reported as being mild. Vital signs showed no consistent changes of clinical relevance.</p><p>In response to the List of Questions interim results were submitted from a multiple dose study (P00272) in subjects with hepatic impairment. The overall incidence of AEs was similar for desloratadine and 3-OH-desloratadine. AEs were reported in 5/11 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and in 5/9 subjects with normal liver function. Headache was the most frequently reported AE (4/9), reported by subjects with normal liver function, while drowsiness was the frequent AE (2/11) in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. Renal There were no noteworthy findings relevant to the renal system in any of the studies performed in the desloratadine clinical program in SAR.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion on clinical safety</head><p>Intake of H1-receptor antagonists has been associated with a specific, potentially fatal polymorphic ventricular tachycardia termed torsade de pointes. This tachycardia is usually observed in the setting of a prolonged QTc interval, often initiated following extrasystolic pauses. In order to evaluate the cardiovascular properties of desloratadine the applicant has performed a separate cardiovascular safety evaluation. In addition, an analysis of the ECGs was conducted based on the CPMP guidelines for assessment of the potential for QT interval prolongation by non-cardiovascular medicinal products was performed.</p><p>In response to the List of Questions the applicant submitted data according to QTc at baseline. The patients with normal QTc at baseline (n=2393, 96%) showed a comparable pattern for QTcprolongation between drug and placebo without evidence for a dose response. No safety concerns were identified for patients who entered the studies with borderline baseline (n=87, 3.5%) and elevated baseline QTc-values (n=19, 0.8%). Neither in the patients with borderline baseline QTc nor in patients with elevated baseline QTc was any increase of &gt;30 msec observed. Based on this, no evidence was found that desloratadine is associated with relevant QTc-prolongation, even in patients with borderline or abnormal baseline values.</p><p>To address the CPMP request to also consider individual values, the applicant submitted data on the shifts between the categories normal QTc, borderline QTc and prolonged QTc according to the CPMP-classification. The shift pattern between the categories of normal, borderline, or prolonged QTc of patients on desloratadine (2.5 to 20 mg) showed a random pattern without evidence of a drug effect. At the same time, the shifts were comparable to placebo.</p><p>There were no AEs that were reported by the "slow" metabolisers that were not reported by the "normal" metabolisers. Also, there were no serious AEs reported by the two groups. Overall, except for gastrointestinal AEs reported in "normal" metabolisers during co-administration of desloratadine and erythromycin, headache was the most frequently reported AE by both groups. At the 5 mg dose there is no difference in the percentage of subjects reporting AEs in the "slow" or "normal" metabolisers. No adverse events relating to the cardiovascular system were reported and the comparison of the electrocardiographic parameters for the "slow" and "normal" metabolisers showed no clinically relevant differences between the two groups. In summary the data shows that there are no clinically meaningful differences with respect to the AE profile of the "slow" versus the "normal" metaboliser.</p></div>

Single dose administration of DL oral lyophilisate, syrup or conventional tablet was safe and well tolerated by most subjects. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. The most commonly reported adverse event was headache, which occurred in 0-10% of subjects in each individual treatment group of both studies. No subjects in study P01216 experienced an adverse event</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">49/60  EMEA 2004</formula><p>that was considered related to treatment and only one subject in study P01419 experienced an adverse event (headache) that was considered related to treatment.</p><p>There was one severe adverse event reported in study P01216. One subject, a 42-year-old male Caucasian, had elevated AST, ALT and LDH. The subject was discontinued from the trial, and a follow up laboratory examination on Day 21 demonstrated a resolution of these findings. These changes were not considered treatment-related.</p><p>One subject in study P01419 reported a severe headache on two separate occasions.</p><p>Based on the Clinical Pharmacology studies, the 5 mg DL oral lyophilisate tablet was found to be bioequivalent to the conventional 5 mg DL tablet formulation and 5 mg of DL syrup. Therefore, it is expected that the 5 mg oral lyophilisate formulation will have the same efficacy and safety profile of the 5 mg DL tablet. Additionally, the bioavailability of DL and 3-OH DL from the oral lyophilisate formulation was not affected by the concomitant administration of food or water. Therefore, the 5 mg oral lyophilisate formulation may be administered without regard to meals or water.</p></div>

The statement regarding hypersensitivity was modified to mention the terms "angioedema", "pruritus" and "urticaria". These events were reported very rarely during the postmarketing period. Furthermore, section 4.8 of the SPC was reorganised by system organ class as requested by the CPMP.</p><p>Following the assessment of the fourth PSUR the following terms: 'somnolence' and 'dizziness' were included in the SPC. The addition of the term 'somnolence' was reflected in subsequent changes to section 4.7 (Effects on ability to drive and use machines) and 5.1 (Pharmacodynamic properties) of the SPC. These changes were also reflected in the Package Leaflet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Desloratadine and hypospadia</head><p>On 25 April 2002, Sweden triggered a referral to the EMEA under Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC for loratadine containing medicinal products. The reason was data from the Swedish Medical Birth Registry (SMBR) suggesting that the use of loratadine during the first trimester of pregnancy may be associated with increased risk of hypospadias (a non-life threatening condition in which the opening of the penis is on the underside rather than the tip of the penis). As desloratadine is the major metabolite of loratadine a referral was therefore also triggered for desloratadine containing medicinal products. The separate referral procedure for loratadine containing medicinal products is not addressed in this EPAR since the CPMP is also assessing other aspects of the safety and efficacy of these nationally approved products. The following scientific discussion therefore only refers to the scientific discussion and conclusions for the desloratadine referral.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Studies Conducted to Date</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Swedish Medical Birth Registry (SMBR)</head><p>In Sweden, drug use is recorded at the first antenatal care visit, which for at least 90% of pregnant women is made before week 14 of pregnancy. The recorded drug use in the first trimester is entered into the SMBR, and these data are thereafter linked to data on pregnancy outcome. Thus, drug use is recorded prospectively to pregnancy outcome. Nearly all deliveries (at least 98%) in Sweden are reported to the SMBR, i.e. about 90 000 / year, and the database contains more than 500 000 pregnancies.</p><p>In an analysis of data from the SMBR in November 2001, 15 cases of hypospadias were identified among 2,780 loratadine-exposed pregnancies. The total prevalence of hypospadias observed in the SMBR is 2.1 out of 1000 pregnancies (boys and girls). The corresponding figure in children (boys and girls) born by mothers who claim to have taken loratadine during early pregnancy was 5.4. The overall adjusted odds ratio, stratifying for year of birth, maternal age and parity, was 2.3 [95% CI 1.4-3.6]. Among the 15 cases, the severity was recorded as mild in 11 cases, moderate in one case and not recorded in 3 cases.</p><p>Hypospadias is a relatively common malformation. Reported background incidences show large variation; however, the CPMP found that the total prevalence of hypospadias in the SMBR falls within the reported background incidences of 0.5 to 3 per 1000 live births.</p><p>The CPMP considered that possible biases that have been identified in the SMBR, including misclassifications, would bias the risk estimate towards 1 or not affect it. The existence of misclassifications should be viewed as contributing to the strength of the signal. That the effect of non-differential misclassification bias is to underestimate the real association is in line with known 56/60  EMEA 2004 epidemiological theory and experience. That there would be any bias in the opposite direction e.g. through the recording of the drug use (the outcome of the pregnancy is not known at the time of the antenatal visit) or the diagnosis of hypospadias is unlikely. The CPMP found that the known confounding factors have been corrected for in the analyses (e.g. parity, smoking, age etc).</p><p>The SMBR has analysed the occurrence of hypospadias with other antihistamines used for allergy treatment. The CPMP concluded that there is no indication of a class effect, of a relation to underlying disease or a bias against this group of products as a whole.</p><p>Outcome of pregnancies in women taking desloratadine or loratadine As of June 1 2002, the MAH's post-marketing surveillance database contained 4 cases involving a pregnancy and maternal exposure to desloratadine. No cases of foetal disorder or birth defects, including hypospadia, were reported.</p><p>The MAH had received approximately 250 reports of loratadine use during pregnancy. These included the 15 hypospadia cases from the SMBR, and 8 spontaneous reports that were received following the initiation of the Article 31 referral procedure. Based on these reports and taking the estimated worldwide use of loratadine (over 15 10 9 patient days of therapy) into account, the CPMP concluded that the spontaneous reporting data did not raise concerns regarding the use of loratadine during pregnancy. On the other hand, considering an expected considerable underreporting, these data are not robust enough to conclude that use of loratadine during pregnancy is safe.</p><p>No reports of hypospadias associated with loratadine/desloratadine were identified in a search of the published literature. Three studies comparing the outcomes of loratadine-exposed pregnancies to controls were identified.</p><p>The CPMP concluded that the three published studies do not indicate an increased risk of congenital malformations with loratadine/desloratadine use. However, the total number of women exposed to loratadine in these studies is less than 200, which is too low to conclude on the lack of risk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preclinical studies External Male Genitalia Development and Importance of Androgens</head><p>The CPMP concluded that antiandrogenic activity is the only currently known non-genetic mechanism for induction of hypospadias. Nevertheless, there are examples where an association between hypospadias and drug intake have been demonstrated in humans e.g. insulins and valproic acid. In these cases, possible mechanisms have not been established, but they are probably not directly related to antiandrogenic activity.</p><p>Moreover, the CPMP considered that there is no evidence from the literature or other sources supporting that hypospadias induced via the known mechanism may occur without signs of other hormonally related effects i.e. signs of antiandrogenic actions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Antiandrogenic endpoints in loratadine /desloratadine studies</head><p>The CPMP assessed a number of parameters addressing antiandrogenic potential, including hypospadias in the loratadine and desloratadine reproductive toxicity studies. One of these studies was designed specifically to evaluate the potential antiandrogenic effect of loratadine in male rat offspring. The CPMP considered that the results of this study demonstrated that loratadine did not affect the development of the male F1 genital tract, including hypospadias, in rats exposed throughout organogenesis and early postnatal development (up to day 4 post partum). The CPMP concluded that there was no indication of antiandrogenic effects in the studied endpoints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other birth registries and Case Control Studies</head><p>The MAH presented results from two other birth registries. When combined they provide experience in 318 loratadine-exposed women during the first trimester of pregnancy. Examination revealed no reports of hypospadias associated with maternal loratadine use and no evidence of an increased rate of major congenital abnormalities among offspring of mothers exposed to loratadine during the first trimester.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>57/60</head><p> <ref type="bibr">EMEA 2004</ref> The CPMP considered that the presented registry data tend to confirm that loratadine/desloratadine does not represent a major teratogenic risk. However, even if no association between loratadine/desloratadine and hypospadia was identified, it can not be concluded that loratadine/desloratadine does not increase the rate of hypospadias since the number of pregnancies in the registries was too small.</p><p>The MAH provided preliminary results from a case control study. The CPMP concluded that the preliminary results show no increase in the odds ratio compared to a standard control population. However, the sample size was limited and the confidence interval wide.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall conclusion on desloratadine and hypospadia</head><p>The CPMP concluded that the safety findings regarding hypospadia emerging for loratadine are considered to be relevant also for desloratadine, being the major metabolite of loratadine, until the opposite has been demonstrated.</p><p>The CPMP concluded that the benefit/risk balance of desloratadine remains favourable and that the available preclinical data for desloratadine/loratadine does not indicate that desloratadine has either genotoxic or antiandrogenic potential.</p><p>The CPMP concluded that the SMBR provides a robust signal that loratadine exposure during pregnancy increases the risk of hypospadia. Reasonable biases that have been identified in the SMBR, including misclassifications, cannot explain the occurrence of the signal. Hence, the current finding is either a chance finding or a true drug effect. The preclinical data argue against a true drug effect. Thus, based on the available data, a causal relationship can neither be confirmed nor excluded. As a precautionary measure the CPMP recommended, that the SPC for desloratadine containing medicinal products should be amended to state that the use of desloratadine during pregnancy is not recommended. This change to section 4.6 of the SPC and section 2 of the Package Leaflet was introduced through a Type II variation.</p><p>The CPMP concluded that continued monitoring of desloratadine is warranted and that the signal should be further investigated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.</head><p>Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality</head><p>The quality of the film-coated tablets is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.</p><p>The quality of the oral lyophilisate and the syrup is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SPC. Satisfactory evidence is provided that product manufacture is well controlled, that consistency of manufacture is achieved and that stable products results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology</head><p>Desloratadine is the major active metabolite of loratadine. It is a more potent H1 receptor antagonist than loratadine itself and in most preclinical studies desloratadine C max and AUC were higher after desloratadine than after an equimolar dose of loratadine. In particular, desloratadine is also a more potent antimuscarinic agent than loratadine when tested at concentrations and doses which far exceed those which exhibit antihistamine activity. Furthermore, this activity of desloratadine is not considered to be of clinical relevance.</p><p>The genotoxicity studies showed that neither desloratadine nor the major human metabolite 3hydroxy-desloratadine are genotoxic.</p><p>The isoenzyme responsible for the major human metabolic pathway of desloratadine, e.g. hydroxylation in position 3 remains to be identified. However, polymorphism seems not to be related to the classical CYP isoenzymes. Therefore, the drug interactions are anticipated to be less than for loratadine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>58/60</head><p> <ref type="bibr">EMEA 2004</ref> Taking into account that the desloratadine conventional 5-mg tablet formulation and the desloratadine syrup and oral lyophilisates are bioequivalent, and based upon the pre-clinical data presented for the film-coated tablet, no toxicological concerns were raised regarding the use of the desloratadine syrup or oral lyophilisate formulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Film-coated tablet</head><p>The data provided support the claim that doses of 5 mg or 7.5 mg are effective in reducing symptoms of Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis as compared to placebo. The results are corroborated by a pooled analysis of the four trials, which showed desloratadine 5 and 7.5 mg to be superior to placebo and the effect of the two desloratadine doses not to be significantly different.</p><p>However, although the mean change following desloratadine 5 and 7.5 mg might be statistically significantly higher than following placebo, the numerical difference is small. The reduction of symptom scores was between 25 and 30% from baseline, which seems to be in concordance with the effect seen for other antihistamines in SAR. However, it seems from the percentage of improvement in Total Symptom Score that the clinical efficacy of 5 mg desloratadine is probably not superior to 10 mg loratadine.</p><p>The efficacy of desloratadine has not been studied in active comparator trials. This was found to be acceptable, as desloratadine is the active metabolite of loratadine, which has been on the market for a long time. Moreover, pharmacokinetic data show that desloratadine exposure is essentially similar after 5 mg desloratadine and 10 mg loratadine.</p><p>The symptom cough was evaluated in 3 out of 4 studies (C98-223, C98224 and C98-225). In none of these studies did the mean change between baseline and post treatment values attain statistical significance compared to placebo. This is also the case for the symptom nasal congestion.</p><p>The onset of action for desloratadine has been demonstrated to occur from 1 to 2 hours after administration.</p><p>Data provided in a Type II variation was found to support the extension of the indication to Allergic Rhinitis. The data showed that 5 mg desloratadine was effective in reducing the symptoms of AR compared to placebo.</p><p>Data provided in a Type II variation was found to support the extension of the indication to include Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria. The data showed that 5 mg desloratadine was effective in reducing the symptoms of CIU compared to placebo.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Oral lyophilisate</head><p>The DL 5 mg film-coated tablet has been found to be effective in the treatment of allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria. Bioequivalence of plasma profiles of the DL 5 mg oral lyophilisate and DL 5 mg film-coated tablet supports the efficacy of the DL 5 mg oral lyophilisate formulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Syrup</head><p>The Clinical Pharmacology program completed by the sponsor has adequately evaluated the pharmacokinetics of desloratadine syrup in paediatrics.</p><p>The exposure of desloratadine in 2-to 5-and 6-to 11-year olds, following the administration of a single 1.25 mg and 2.5 mg dose of desloratadine syrup, respectively, is comparable to the exposure observed in adults following a single dose of desloratadine 5.0 mg tablet.</p><p>Based on the demonstrated safety and efficacy of desloratadine in adults, and also on a favourable safety and efficacy profile from the considerable loratadine syrup exposure in the paediatric population, it is anticipated that desloratadine syrup will be safe and efficacious in the paediatric population.</p><p>The bioavailability of the syrup formulation is unaffected by the concomitant administration of food.</p><p>It is considered acceptable to extrapolate paediatric efficacy of desloratadine from the desloratadine efficacy studies in adults, as a full clinical program has been performed with desloratadine in adults and since the nature and course of the diseases (allergic rhinitis and CIU) are similar in adults and paediatric patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Film-coated tablet</head><p>In a pooled analysis of safety data from ten studies of DL 5mg tablet in several indications (including the AR and CIU indications) the most common related TEAE was headache with 4.5% in subjects in the desloratadine 5 mg group and 3.9% in the placebo group. Other frequently reported TEAEs were dry mouth (2.6% for desloratadine, 1.8% for placebo), fatigue (1.8% for desloratadine, 0.6% for placebo) and somnolence (1.9% for both desloratadine and placebo).</p><p>Most of the AEs reported during the studies were graded as mild to moderate in severity. The overall incidence of severe adverse events in the SAR studies was similar among the treatment groups with 3-5% in the desloratadine groups and 3% in the placebo group. In the CIU studies severe treatment related adverse events occurred in less than 1% in both treatment groups.</p><p>Neither the mean values QTc nor the individual changes showed an effect of desloratadine on QTc compared to placebo.</p><p>The polymorphism in the metabolism of desloratadine did not lead to higher adverse event rates or new adverse events and it was not associated with a change in cardiovascular safety.</p><p>The enzyme(s) as well as the tissue site(s) responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine to its primary metabolite 3-OH-desloratadine has not yet been identified. However, it is anticipated that the potential for PK interactions of desloratadine is low, as the metabolism does not appear to be mediated by a known cytochrome P450 enzyme and the drug is neither a substrate or an inhibitor of pglycoprotein.</p><p>Normal metabolisers with moderate hepatic impairment could experience a 3-fold increase in the desloratadine exposure (median AUC). However, no apparent difference between the exposure to desloratadine in slow metabolisers with and without hepatic impairment was seen. Given that the increase in median exposure between normal and poor metabolisers is 6-fold and that there is no major differences in the safety profile for poor and normal metabolisers a dose reduction is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment.</p><p>Patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, who were normal metabolisers has a 1.5-2.5 fold increase in AUC for desloratadine and minimal changes in 3-OH-desloratadine concentrations, therefore a warning concerning the use in patients with renal impairment is recommended. This is reflected in the SPC (see section 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use).</p></div>
