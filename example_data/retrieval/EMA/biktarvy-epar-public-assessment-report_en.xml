<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Background information on the procedure</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Submission of the dossier</head><p>The applicant Gilead Sciences International Limited submitted on 21 June 2017 an application for marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Biktarvy through the centralised procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 3 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 28 April 2016.</p><p>The applicant applied for the following indication: The treatment of adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) without any known mutations associated with resistance to the individual components (see section 5.1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The legal basis for this application refers to:</head><p>Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC -complete and independent application</p><p>The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, nonclinical and clinical data based on applicants' own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting certain tests or studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Information on Paediatric requirements</head><p>Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation <ref type="formula">(</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>New active substance status</head><p>The applicant requested the active substance bictegravir contained in the above medicinal product to be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scientific advice</head><p>The applicant received scientific advices from the CHMP: The CHMP, in the light of the overall data submitted and the scientific discussion within the Committee, issued a positive opinion for granting a marketing authorisation to Biktarvy 26 April 2018 2. Scientific discussion 2.1. Problem statement</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Scientific</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Disease or condition</head><p>HIV-1 infection is a blood-born infection. HIV is a retrovirus that infects and replicates primarily in human CD4+ T cells and macrophages. HIV can be transmitted via blood, blood products, sexual fluids, other fluids containing blood, and breast milk. Most individuals are infected with HIV through sexual contact, before birth or during delivery, during breast-feeding, or when sharing contaminated needles and syringes (intravenous drug users). Sexual intercourse is the most common, albeit inefficient, mode of HIV transmission. The risk of transmission per exposure is low; estimates are on the order of 0.1% per contact for heterosexual transmission, but this varies considerably and increases with concurrent ulcerative STDs, high HIV viral load in the subject, and lack of antiretroviral therapy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Epidemiology</head><p>There are approximately 37 million people worldwide living with HIV-1. HIV-1 infection remains a lifethreatening disease in infected persons who do not receive adequate treatment sufficiently early in the course of the infection and/or are infected with virus that is resistant to anti-retroviral agents of several classes such that an adequate treatment regimen cannot be constructed from approved agents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3.">Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis</head><p>Acute HIV-1 infection is often missed, as it usually presents with nonspecific signs and symptoms (including fever, rash, or diarrhoea), or goes without clinical symptoms. If symptoms are present, these generally emerge approximately 2 weeks following HIV infection. Among those presenting with symptoms, the number of symptoms correlates with higher pre-seroconversion peak plasma viral load.</p><p>Diagnosis most often occurs during chronic infection. Recent estimates suggest that even in high income settings; about 25-35% of people living with HIV starting ART have a CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mm3. In some settings, up to half of people present to care with advanced HIV disease -defined by WHO as having a CD4 cell count &lt;200 cells/mm3 or a WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 disease.</p><p>Most HIV-infected individuals will eventually develop progressive immunodeficiency marked by CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell depletion and leading to AIDS-defining illnesses and premature death, if remain untreated. Leading causes of mortality among adults with advanced HIV disease globally include tuberculosis (TB), severe bacterial infections, cryptococcal meningitis, toxoplasmosis and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.</p><p>Diagnostic tests for HIV-1 infection include assays for HIV-1 RNA, p24 antigen, and HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.4.">Management</head><p>Standard of care for the treatment of HIV-1 infection uses combination ART to suppress viral replication to below detectable limits, allow CD4 cell counts to increase, and stop disease progression.</p><p>For ART-naive HIV-infected patients, current treatment guidelines suggest that initial therapy consists of 2 nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N[t]RTIs) and either an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), rilpivirine, or the boosted protease inhibitor (PI), darunavir (DRV). Virologically suppressed HIV-infected patients may switch from their current regimen because of safety or tolerability concerns or for regimen simplification. All patient populations may benefit from once-daily FDC regimens as these have been shown to provide increased adherence and improved clinical and virologic outcomes.</p><p>Integrase strand-transfer inhibitors (INSTI), such as raltegravir (RAL) and elvitegravir (EVG), exhibit strong antiviral activity, good clinical tolerability and have become attractive options as third agents in combination therapy for HIV-1 infected patients. Both RAL and EVG have relatively short human halflives and must be administered twice daily (BID) (for RAL) or in combination with a boosting agent (for EVG) for once daily (QD) administration. The most recently approved INSTI, dolutegravir (DTG), has a PK profile that allows administration once a day (QD) without a boosting agent; however, BID dosing is recommended when DTG is co-administered with CYP and/or UGT inducers (e.g., EFV, fos-AMP/r, TPV/r, or rifampin) and in patients with INSTI associated resistance substitutions or clinically suspected INSTI resistance. Dolutegravir is available as a fixed dose combination with abacavir and lamivudine and is currently used as first line therapy. The new fixed dose combination with Bictegravir as INSTI contains tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and emtricitabine as a backbone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>About the product</head><p>Bictegravir is a potent INSTI that is being evaluated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and that has demonstrated a terminal half-life suitable for once-daily administration without a boosting agent.</p><p>Emtricitabine and TAF form a guideline-recommended N(t)RTI backbone for ART-naïve HIV-infected patients. Tenofovir alafenamide is also approved as a single agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection, and F/TAF is a guideline-recommended backbone for patients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV).</p><p>B/F/TAF is a potent, convenient, tolerable, and practical regimen for the long-term treatment of patients with HIV infection. The small tablet size of the FDC is expected to provide an additional benefit, especially in patients for whom pill swallowing can be a barrier to treatment compliance, (eg, the elderly). Based on the clinical studies performed within this application, the Applicant claims that: The Applicant's proposed indication was: TRADENAME is indicated for the treatment of adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) without any known mutations associated with resistance to the individual components</p><p>The Applicant's proposed posology was:</p><p>One tablet to be taken once daily in adults.</p></div>

Each bottle contains silica gel desiccant and a polyester coil.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Active Substance</head><p>Emtricitabine (FTC)</p><p>The information on chemistry, manufacturing and control of emtricitabine active substance has been assessed previously via the centralised procedure and approved in the EU as part of the marketing authorisations for Emtriva, Truvada, Atripla, Eviplera, Stribild, Descovy, Genvoya and Odefsey.</p><p>The Module 3.2.S sections of the dossier for emtricitabine provided by the applicant are identical to the 3.2.S sections submitted and approved with the aforementioned marketing authorisations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General information</head><p>The chemical name of emtricitabine is 4-amino-5-fluoro-1-[(2R,5S)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-oxathiolan-5-yl]-1,2-dihydropyrimidin-2-one corresponding to the molecular formula C 8 H 10 FN 3 O 3 S. It has a relative molecular mass of 247.24 g/mol and the following structure (figure 1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1: emtricitabine structure</head><p>The structure of emtricitabine was elucidated by a combination of 1 H and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and single crystal x-ray determination.</p><p>Emtricitabine appears as a white to off-white non-hygroscopic crystalline powder, freely soluble in methanol and water. Its pKa is 2.65 and the partition coefficient Log P is -0.43. It has 2 chiral centres at carbons 2 and 5 of the oxathiolane ring. Two enantiomeric pairs of diastereomers can exist: cis-(-)-FTC and cis-(+)-FTC, trans-(-)-FTC and trans-(+)-FTC. The synthetic route has been chosen to be stereoselective for the formation of the desired cis-(-) enantiomer, emtricitabine. Three polymorphs of emtricitabine have been observed. However, the most stable thermodynamically form at room temperature, is consistently produced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacture, characterisation and process controls</head><p>Emtricitabine is manufactured by two possible synthetic routes sharing a common first step and followed by two options comprising either one or two extra steps. The synthesis was described in sufficient detail. Batch analysis data on 22 commercial scale batches of emtricitabine from all proposed manufacturers were provided. The results comply with the specifications and confirm consistency and uniformity of the manufacturing process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability</head><p>Stability data from 3 production scale batches of finished product covering both manufacturers and processes stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches were packaged in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Samples were tested for appearance, assay, impurity content and water content. No changes were observed to any of the measured parameters over time, and no trends were visible.</p><p>Emtricitabine is known not to be photosensitive.</p><p>Based on the long-term stability data, the proposed re-test period and storage conditions when emtricitabine is packed in the proposed packaging materials is considered acceptable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tenofovir Alafenamide Fumarate (TAF Fumarate)</head><p>The information on chemistry, manufacturing and control of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate has been assessed previously via the centralised procedure and approved in the EU as part of the marketing authorisations Descovy, Genvoya, Odefsey, Vemlidy and Symtuza.</p><p>The Module 3.2.S sections of the dossier for tenofovir alafenamide fumarate provided by the applicant are identical to the 3.2.S sections submitted and approved within the aforementioned marketing authorisations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General information</head><p>The chemical name of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate is propan-2-yl N-[(S)-({[(2R)-1-(6-amino-9Hpurin-9-yl)propan-2-yl]-oxy}methyl)(phenoxy)phosphoryl]-L-alaninate, (2E)-but-2-enedioate (2:1) corresponding to the molecular formula C 23 H 31 N 6 O 7 P. It has a relative molecular mass of 534.5 g/mol and the following structure (Figure 2):</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2: tenofovir alafenamide fumarate structure</head><p>The chemical structure of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate has been adequately demonstrated by infrared spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy ( 1 H, 13 C, and 31 P), mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography.</p><p>The active substance is a white to off-white or tan, slightly hygroscopic powder. Tenofovir alafenamide exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of three chiral centres. The chiral centre at the propyloxy-side chain is in the R-configuration. The absolute stereoconfiguration of the carbonylethylamino-substituent is derived from the amino acid L-alanine, which has the Sconfiguration at the alpha-carbon. The remaining stereocentre is located at the phosphorus atom and is in the S-configuration. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC at the point of the introduction of the chiral starting material and in a manufacturing process intermediate.</p><p>Polymorphism has been observed for tenofovir alafenamide fumarate. A single polymorphic form is consistently generated through the manufacturing process and this form has been adequately characterised.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacture, characterisation and process controls</head><p>Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate is obtained from two manufacturers using the same synthetic route.</p><p>The active substance is synthesized in multiple steps using well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications.</p><p>Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.</p><p>Critical process parameters and material attributes were identified using a risk assessment approach.</p><p>The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical development program. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process.</p><p>The active substance is packaged in double-lined polyethylene bags which comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. The bags are held in high-density polyethylene drums (or other suitable secondary container) with lids of appropriate size and fitted with a security seal.</p><p>The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specification</head><p>The specification for tenofovir alafenamide fumarate includes tests for appearance (visual examination), identity (IR, HPLC), identity of fumaric acid (HPLC), clarity of solution (visual examination), water content (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC, HPLC-MS, GC), residual solvents (GC), elemental impurities (ICP MS), and melting point (Ph. Eur.).</p><p>Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set.</p><p>The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standard used for assay testing has been presented. Batch analysis data from 16 batches of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate, (13 of which were commercial scale and 3 pilot scale), manufactured at both proposed manufacturing sites were provided. Additional batch analysis data for development batches used in pre-clinical pharmacokinetics and toxicological studies were also provided.

Results under stressed conditions for up to 6 months at 40 ºC / 75% RH on 5 batches were provided. Additionally, results for 4 days at 60 ºC / ambient RH, for 4 days at 50 ºC / ambient RH and for 4 days at -20 ºC were also provided on one batch.</p><p>Samples were tested for appearance, impurities, assay, water content, and solid state characteristics (XRD and melting point). The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating.</p><p>Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch, indicating that the active substance is not photosensitive.</p><p>The stability results indicate that tenofovir alafenamide fumarate manufactured by the both proposed suppliers is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed re-test period at the recommended long-term storage condition in the proposed container.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bictegravir sodium (BIC)</head><p>Bictegravir sodium is a new active substance. Information is provided by the applicant in a full module 3.2.S.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General information</head><p>The chemical name of bictegravir sodium is sodium (2R,5S,13aR)-7,9-dioxo-10-[(2,4,6trifluorobenzyl)carbamoyl]-2, <ref type="bibr">3,4,5,7,9,13,13a-octahydro-2,5-methanopyrido[1',2':4,5]</ref> The chemical structure of bictegravir sodium was elucidated by a combination of 1 H, 13 C and 19 F NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, UV and IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and x-ray crystallography.</p><p>Bictegravir sodium contains 3 chiral centres. Overall stereochemistry is tested in the active substance by chiral HPLC before release.</p><p>The solid state properties of bictegravir sodium were established by x-ray powder diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic vapour sorption. The active substance is an off-white to yellow slightly hygroscopic crystalline solid. Only 1 polymorphic form was identified during development. It is practically insoluble in aqueous media across the physiological pH range, including simulated fed and fasted state intestinal fluids, and very slightly soluble at pH 8.8. Particle size is limited in the active substance specification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacture, characterisation and process controls</head><p>Bictegravir sodium is synthesized in multiple steps using well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. The starting materials were justified in line with the expectations in ICH Q11</p><p>and its Q&amp;A and are deemed acceptable.</p><p>Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The process was optimised through a series of univariate and multivariate experiments, informed by risk assessment as to which steps were likely to be most critical. Operational ranges and set-points are defined for each step of the manufacturing process and are justified by the data provided. No design spaces are claimed.</p><p>Detailed information on the origin, fate and purge of impurities was provided in order to justify limits for impurities in the starting materials, intermediates, and the active substance. A risk assessment for mutagenic impurities was carried out in line with ICH M7. One impurity with a structural alert was shown to be negative in an Ames test. Another known mutagenic impurity was consistently found in an intermediate at levels well below 30% of the TTC and is thus controlled according to ICH M7 option 4.</p><p>The specifications and control methods for intermediates, starting materials and reagents have been presented and are deemed acceptable.</p><p>The active substance is packaged in double PE bags, inside an HDPE drum, which comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specification</head><p>The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), clarity of solution (visual inspection), water content (KF), sodium content (HPLC-CAD), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents and organic volatile impurities (GC), enantiomeric purity (chiral HPLC) and particle size (laser light scattering).</p><p>Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. A risk assessment and batch analysis carried out for the finished product in line with ICH Q3D demonstrated that no test for elemental impurities, other than the sodium content, is needed. The active substance has low water activity and no significant bioburden was noted during release testing and stability studies so no test for microbiological quality is included. Only 1 polymorphic form has been identified, which is stable and routinely produced by the manufacturing process as determined by XRPD, so no test is needed.</p><p>The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.</p><p>Batch analysis data on 22 lab, pilot and production scale batches of bictegravir sodium covering both manufacturers and an additional manufacturer used in early development, were provided. These included the 3 productions scale validation batches from each manufacturer. The results were within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability</head><p>Stability data from 8 pilot scale batches of active substance covering both proposed manufacturers, and an additional manufacturer used in early development, stored in the intended commercial package for up to 24 months under long term conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Samples were tested for appearance, assay, related substances, water content, enantiomeric purity, polymorphic form and microbial purity. No significant changes were noted over time and all parameters remained within specification throughout the study period. In addition, studies have begun using the 3 process validation batches from each proposed commercial manufacturer which will be tested according to the accepted protocol.</p><p>Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 1 batch. Bictegravir sodium is not photosensitive.</p><p>Samples were also stored at either -20 or 60 o C for up to 2 weeks. No changes to any of the measured parameters were observed.</p><p>The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period when stored at the recommended long term storage condition in the proposed container.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Finished Medicinal Product</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development</head><p>Biktarvy is a fixed dose combination, immediate release, film-coated tablet containing bictegravir sodium, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate as active substances. The tablets are purplish-brown capsule-shaped, and debossed with GSI on one face and "9883" on the other.</p><p>Bictegravir sodium is a crystalline, stable, BCS class II compound exhibiting low solubility but high permeability. Emtricitabine is a crystalline BCS class I compound with high solubility and permeability which degrades by hydrolysis in aqueous solution and to a much smaller degree, in the solid phase.</p><p>TAF fumarate is a BCS class III molecule, highly soluble but poorly permeable, which undergoes pHdependent hydrolysis in aqueous solution.</p><p>The formulation evolved throughout development. The commercial formulation is the same as that used in phase III clinical trials, which was shown to be equivalent to earlier clinical formulations by suitable bridging studies.</p><p>The choice of manufacturing process and excipients was based on the properties of the active substances. Process parameters for the film-coating process are considered suitable. The development of the dissolution method took into account the differing solubilities and stabilities of the 3 active substances. Emtricitabine and TAF fumarate are soluble in aqueous media, whereas bictegravir is poorly soluble in aqueous media across the physiological pH range. However, TAF fumarate is unstable below pH 5 and above pH 6, so a medium with pH 5.5 was selected.</p><p>Various manufacturing parameters with potential to impact the dissolution rate were examined during development and have been set at levels guaranteed to produce Biktarvy tablets of the required quality. The dissolution method was developed in order to identify tablets manufactured outside of the defined process and its discriminatory power is considered adequate.</p><p>The manufacturing development has been evaluated through the use of risk assessment and design of experiments to identify the critical product quality attributes and critical process parameters. The risk identification was based on the prior knowledge of products with similar formulations and manufacturing processes as well as on the experience from formulation development and process design.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Introduction</head><p>The definitive safety pharmacology, toxicology, and toxicokinetic studies provided for BIC, FTC, and TAF were conducted in accordance with guidelines issued by the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) and with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) or other applicable regulations promulgated by international health authorities. Pilot, exploratory, and mechanistic studies were either conducted in full compliance with GLP procedures or were conducted using appropriate protocols and documentation to assure data integrity.   Cells are permeable to TAF and, due to increased plasma stability and intracellular activation through hydrolysis by cathepsin A, TAF is more efficient than TDF in loading tenofovir into PBMCs (including lymphocytes and other HIV target cells) and macrophages. Intracellular tenofovir is subsequently phosphorylated to the pharmacologically active metabolite, tenofovir diphosphate. Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits HIV and HBV replication through incorporation into viral DNA by the HIV-1 or HBV reverse transcriptase, which results in DNA chain-termination. Bictegravir maintained potent antiviral activity against HIV-1 variants resistant to currently approved ARVs from the NRTI, NNRTI, and protease inhibitor (PI) classes. Bictegravir displays a resistance profile similar to that of dolutegravir (DTG) and markedly improved compared with that of raltegravir </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FTC</head><p>Emtricitabine, an NRTI, is a synthetic analogue of the naturally occurring pyrimidine nucleoside, 2′deoxycytidine. Intracellularly, FTC is converted through 3 phosphorylation reactions to its active triphosphorylated anabolite emtricitabine 5′-triphosphate (FTC-TP) <ref type="bibr">[Furman 1992</ref><ref type="bibr">, Paff 1994</ref>.</p><p>Emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate inhibits the activity of viral polymerases, including HIV-1 RT by direct binding competition with the natural deoxyribonucleotide substrate (deoxycytidine triphosphate) and by being incorporated into nascent viral DNA, which results in chain termination {Wilson 1993}. FTC has activity that is specific to HIV (HIV-1 and HIV-2) and HBV. The EC50 of FTC against laboratory adapted strains of HIV-1 ranged from 0.001 to 0.62 µM depending on cell type and virus strain used in the assay <ref type="bibr">[Jeong 1993</ref><ref type="bibr">, Painter 1995</ref><ref type="bibr">, Schinazi 1992</ref>. (EC50 values ranged from 0.007 to 1.5 μM).</p><p>HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to FTC have been selected in cell culture. Reduced susceptibility to FTC was associated with M184V/I mutations in HIV-1 RT. Tenofovir has activity that is specific to HBV in addition to HIV-1 and HIV-2. The antiviral activity of TAF against a panel of HBV clinical isolates representing genotypes A-H was assessed in HepG2 cells.</p><p>The EC50 values for TAF ranged from 34.7 to 134.4 nM, with an overall mean EC50 of 86.6 nM. The concentration that resulted in 50% cytotoxicity (CC50) in HepG2 cells was &gt;44,400 nM. The combination of TFV and FTC was studied for cytotoxicity in MT-2 cells. No cytotoxicity was observed at the highest concentrations tested, up to 50 μM TFV and 5 μM FTC. Cytotoxicity studies were also conducted on the combination of TFV and FTC in HepG2 cells and no cytotoxicity was observed.</p><p>The antiviral activity of TAF was evaluated against a panel of HBV isolates containing nucleos(t)ide RT inhibitor mutations in HepG2 cells. HBV isolates expressing the rtV173L, rtL180M, and rtM204V/I substitutions associated with resistance to LAM remained susceptible to TAF (&lt; 2-fold change in EC50).</p><p>HBV isolates expressing the rtL180M, rtM204V plus rtT184G, rtS202G, or rtM250V substitutions associated with resistance to entecavir remained susceptible to TAF. HBV isolates expressing the rtA181T, rtA181V, or rtN236T single substitutions associated with resistance to adefovir remained susceptible to TAF; however, the HBV isolate expressing rtA181V plus rtN236T exhibited reduced susceptibility to TAF (3.7-fold change in EC50). The clinical relevance of these substitutions is not known.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B/F/TAF</head><p>Bictegravir, FTC, and TAF are potent and selective inhibitors of HIV-1. All 3 drugs show potent ARV activity against diverse subtypes of HIV-1 in vitro.

In vivo safety pharmacology experiments were conducted using TAF as the monofumarate form in 50 mM citric acid. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for the inhibitory effect of TAF on hERG potassium current was estimated to be &gt; 10 μM, far above human plasma exposure. There were no adverse effects detected in the CNS in rats dosed at 1000 mg/kg or in the renal system in rats administered 1000 mg/kg. In the chronic repeat dose dog study, a doserelated prolongation of PR interval was noted at Week 39; however, in the single dose CV safety pharmacology study in dogs dosed t 100 mg/kg (80 mg free base equivalents/kg), there were no findings. There was reduced gastric emptying in rats dosed at 1000 mg/kg but not at 100 mg/kg.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B/F/TAF</head><p>A comprehensive safety pharmacology program has been conducted for the 3 individual components of the B/F/TAF regimen. While the designs for these safety studies varied between the agents, the major organ systems were evaluated. Bictegravir had no effect on vital organ systems in safety pharmacology studies. Neither FTC nor TAF had clinically relevant effects on vital organ systems in safety pharmacology studies. Although TAF showed some potential to prolong the PR interval in the 39-week dog study (TOX-120-002), no PR prolongation or any change in ECG results occurred in the CV safety pharmacology study r in the thorough QT study (GS-US-120-0107). Neither BIC nor FTC had an effect on PR interval in safety pharmacology studies; therefore, there is no potential for overlapping toxicity. Overall, the pharmacological assessment of BIC, FTC, and TAF supports the effective use of these 3 agents together in combination therapy for HIV-1 infection.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacokinetics</head><p>A comprehensive nonclinical program defining the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and drug interaction potential of BIC, FTC and TAF/TFV has been completed. The nonclinical pharmacokinetic and disposition studies discussed in this section provide an adequate basis for comparing and interpreting results from toxicology and clinical studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods of analysis</head><p>The plasma BIC concentrations in nonclinical PK studies in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, and monkey were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) or by liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to ultraviolet (UV) detection (LC-UV) methods. FTC: Analytical methods used to quantify FTC in mouse, rat, and monkey plasma from the early preclinical absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies employed reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and HPLC-MS (plasma and urine). LC-radio-profiling has been utilised to detect [3H]FTC in mice and monkeys, and to detect [14C]FTC in rats and monkeys.</p><p>TAF: Levels of TAF and TFV in rats and dog plasma and PBMCs were determined using fluorescence derivitization/HPLC. Additional methods to detect levels of TAF and TFV in mouse, rat, rabbit and dog plasma/PMBCs included validated LC/MS/MS methods, and HPLC detection methods. The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of TAF were assessed in various species following a single oral administration of [14C]TAF, and levels of TAF and its metabolites were measured using LSC, HPLC or LC/MS/MS coupled with flow-through detector (RFD). In vitro determination of TAF levels were in the main determined by LC/MS/MS, with some LC-radio-profiling. Induction potential of TAF on CYP activity measured mRNA levels using qRT PCR methods.</p><p>The bioanalytical methods are considered adequate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Absorption</head><p>Bictegravir was absorbed quickly following oral solution administration, reaching maximal plasma concentrations (C max ) within 4 hours post-dose. The oral bioavailability of BIC solution formulation was moderate to high (42% to 74%).</p><p>Bictegravir was highly permeable and showed efflux transport in Caco-2 cell monolayers. Bictegravir was a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The PK of BIC was determined in male rats, dogs, and monkeys following administration of oral solutions. Bictegravir systemic plasma clearance was low in nonclinical species (0.1% to 1.3% of hepatic blood flow). Bictegravir volume of distribution (Vss; 0.09 to 0.22 L/kg) in animals was lower than total body water. Bictegravir showed moderate to high oral bioavailability (42% to 74%) in nonclinical species. Bictegravir plasma exposure increased following repeat oral administration of BIC; the increases in C max and AUC were less than dose proportional. In rats, females had higher BIC Cmax and AUC0-24 values than males, with gender-based differences of 2-to 3-fold on study days 90 and 181 for animals administered the high dose (300 mg/kg/day). In female rats administered the low dose (5 mg/kg/day), an accumulation (~ 3-fold) was observed. In monkeys, gender-based differences in BIC Cmax and AUC values were less than 2-fold and no accumulation (&lt; 2-fold) of BIC was observed after repeat dosing.</p><p>FTC: No in vitro permeability studies have been carried out with FTC, as FTC shows high, doseindependent bioavailability in vivo in mice and monkeys. Single-dose pharmacokinetics of FTC have been studied in mice, rats and cynomolgus monkeys. FTC was rapidly and well absorbed with oral bioavailability ranging from 58% to 97% over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg/kg.</p><p>The multiple-dose pharmacokinetic parameters for FTC were derived as part of the repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice (80 to 3000 mg/kg/day; Study Nos. TOX109; IUW00701; TOX599; TOX628), in rats (60 to 3000 mg/kg/day; Study Nos. TOX108; TOX097), and monkeys (40 to 2000 mg/kg/day; Study Nos. TOX600; TOX627; TOX032) dosed for periods of 3 days to 104 weeks. There were no significant differences in pharmacokinetics following single and multiple dosing. Exposure to FTC (Cmax and AUC) increased approximately proportionally with dose and was similar between males and females.</p><p>TAF: Permeability of TAF was examined using Caco-2 cells (Study No. AD-120-2037). TAF was applied to monolayers of these cells at 10, 100, and 1000 μM, and TAF showed a dose dependent increase in forward permeability and a decrease in efflux ratio indicating saturable efflux transport. Addition of the efflux transport inhibitor, cyclosporine A (CsA) diminished the efflux ratio and increased the permeability. In rats, no consistent differences in plasma pharmacokinetic parameters were found between male and female rats. Mean tenofovir Cmax and AUC values increased dose proportionally over the dose range of 5 to 100 mg/kg/day. Mean TFV AUC obtained on Day 1 was slightly lower than that measured during Weeks 13 and 26, which suggested that there was a slight accumulation of tenofovir with repeat dosing. In dogs, there was some accumulation of tenofovir following repeat dosing (~3-fold).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distribution</head><p>BIC was highly protein bound in plasma from all species tested (&gt; 98% bound) and was 99.75% bound in humans. BIC is widely distributed with a rapid distribution but a very slow elimination (radioactivity was not eliminated from most tissues by 168h). BIC poorly crosses the blood:brain, blood:eye and blood:testis barriers and there is no preferential association with melanin. Pups were exposed to BIC according prenatal and postnatal development study in rats.</p><p>FTC: The protein binding of FTC was very low (&lt; 5%) in mouse, rabbit, monkey, and human plasma Pharmacokinetic parameters for FTC in pregnant animals appeared to be generally similar to those reported for non-pregnant animals. Emtricitabine was readily transferred across the placenta. Excretion into milk has not been evaluated for FTC.</p><p>TAF: The protein binding of TFV has been determined in human plasma and serum using centrifugal ultrafiltration (Study No. P0504-00039.1). Percent of unbound TFV was 99.3 ± 3.3% in human plasma, and 92.8 ± 3.6% in human serum. Tenofovir therefore showed very low protein binding in either human plasma or serum. There was rapid distribution to most tissues, both to mice, pigmented and non-pigmented rats. The tissues showing the highest maximum concentrations of radioactivity included kidney cortex, kidney(s), kidney medulla, and liver in mice and rats. In animal studies it has been shown that tenofovir was transferred across the placenta and was excreted in milk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metabolism</head><p>Unchanged BIC was the principal radiolabel component in all species (≥ 67 % in plasma). Bictegravir is metabolized by CYP3A oxidation and UGT conjugation and, hence, BIC plasma exposure may be altered by inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. Despite the fact that the sulfate conjugate of hydroxylated BIC (M20) was present at higher concentrations in human than other species (20.1% in human versus 11.3% in rat and 0.77% in monkey), exposure of M20 in rats is estimated to be approximately 9-fold higher than observed human exposure at the clinical dose of 50 mg, and therefore further nonclinical characterization according to ICH M3 (R2) is not warranted.</p><p>There are no metabolism data in rabbit and therefore it cannot be concluded if findings in the EFD study in rabbit are caused by rabbit specific metabolites. However, rabbit have been exposed to BIC and rats have been well exposed to the major human metabolite M20.</p><p>FTC: FTC is not subject to significant metabolism by CYP enzymes. Generation of a minor (~1%) sulfoxide metabolite (M1 and/or M2) was catalysed by CYP3A4, and inhibitor studies suggested that at least one other enzyme, possibly flavin-containing monooxygenase, may play a role (Study No. 15396 v1). A minor direct glucuronide metabolite, M3, was also detected. FTC was not extensively metabolised and is eliminated primarily as unchanged drug by renal excretion in mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys. Over 90% of the radioactivity in mouse and rat urine and 64% of the radioactivity in monkey urine was unchanged drug. Only trace levels of metabolites were found in faeces (Study Nos. TEIN/93/0015, TEIN/93/0016, TOX063). In all 3 species, metabolism accounted for only a minor percentage of FTC elimination. FTC is subject to Phase I metabolism (oxidation to a diastereomeric sulfoxide) and to some direct conjugation (glucuronidation of hydroxymethyl group) as minor metabolic routes.</p><p>TAF: Tenofovir alafenamide is subject to intracellular metabolism to TFV, which is further phosphorylated to the anabolites, TFV-MP and TFV-DP with TFV-DP being the pharmacologically active form.</p><p>The Applicant has proposed a possible metabolism pathway based upon the findings from mice, rats, dogs and humans. TAF is also subject to intracellular metabolism to TFV, which is further phosphorylated to the anabolites, tenofovir-monophosphate and TFV-DP with TFV-DP being the pharmacologically active form.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Excretion</head><p>BIC was mainly eliminated through metabolism by the liver (34-40%) followed by excretion into feces (20-40%) and urine (7-15%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FTC: The primary route of elimination of [3H]FTC and [14C]FTC was via renal excretion of parent drug</head><p>after oral and IV administration in mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys. The majority of the FTC recovered in the faeces after oral administration most likely represents unabsorbed drug, rather than biliary excretion. Although FTC is metabolized to only a minor extent, its metabolites are also excreted via the kidneys. Excretion into milk has not been evaluated for FTC. Other toxicological studies using this active substance indicate no risk of acute toxicity.</p></div>

The</p><p>Applicant's conclusion on that the hepatobiliary effects observed in monkeys are not of relevance for humans is essentially solely based on the results of 4 Phase 3 clinical studies. It is not to be excluded the possibility that, depending on systemic exposure levels, the hepatobiliary effects observed in monkeys may represent a potential risk to humans, for which there is not a high safety margin. This information is considered of potential relevance to the prescriber and is included in section 5.3 of the SmPC.</p></div>

Treatment-related effects were confined to high-dose groups only and included changes in red blood cell (RBC) parameters, interpreted as a mild, reversible anaemia (mice 1 month, 6 months; rat 3 months; monkey 1 year); changes in various organ weights without any associated adverse histopathological effects in rodents (mouse 1 month, 6 months; rat 3 months), increased urine output (mice 6 months), and soft faeces (monkeys 1 month, 3 months). No observed effect levels (NOELs) could be established for all treatment-related effects, and in several cases the minor effects observed were reversible after a recovery period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TAF</head><p>Non-clinical studies of tenofovir alafenamide in rats and dogs revealed bone and kidney as the primary target organs of toxicity. Bone toxicity was observed as reduced BMD in rats and dogs at tenofovir exposures at least four times greater than those expected after administration of Descovy. A minimal infiltration of histiocytes was present in the eye in dogs at tenofovir alafenamide and tenofovir exposures of approximately 4 and 17 times greater, respectively, than those expected after administration of Descovy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bictegravir/FTC/TAF</head><p>No repeated dose toxicity studies have been conducted with the bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide triple combination. This is accepted, taking into account the lack of overlapping toxicities and the already available clinical experience with the combination. The Applicant considers that the increased phosphorous levels observed in rat repeat dose toxicity studies with bictegravir is not biologically significant and not relevant for consideration of the safety profile of the combination. This is based mostly on the lack of bone or renal microscopic findings in the rat 26 week repeated dose toxicity and carcinogenicity studies conducted with bictegravir and on an, as claimed, acceptable renal and bone clinical safety data for B/F/TAF.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacokinetics</head><p>The single dose PK of BIC has been determined in rats, dogs and monkeys. In rats, females had higher BIC Cmax and AUC0-24 values than males, with gender-based differences of 2-to 3-fold on study days 90 and 181 for animals administered the high dose (300 mg/kg/day). In female rats administered the low dose (5 mg/kg/day), an accumulation (~ 3-fold) was observed.</p><p>Bictegravir was absorbed quickly following oral solution administration, reaching maximal plasma concentrations (C max ) within 4 hours post-dose, and is widely distributed with a rapid distribution but a very slow elimination. The oral bioavailability of BIC solution formulation was moderate to high (42% to 74%). Despite the fact that the sulfate conjugate of hydroxylated BIC (M20) was present at higher concentrations in human than other species (20.1% in human versus 11.3% in rat and 0.77% in monkey), exposure of M20 in rats is estimated to be approximately 9-fold higher than observed human exposure at the clinical dose of 50 mg, and therefore further nonclinical characterization according to ICH M3 (R2) is not warranted. There are no metabolism data in rabbit. No novel nonclinical pharmacokinetics studies with FTC or TAF have been submitted with this application.

Nonetheless, a DDI study with midazolam (study GS-US-1538) and rilpivirine (GS-US-120-0117), both CYP3A4 substrates, discard any significant induction or inhibition of CYP3A4 by TAF in vivo.</p><p>No UGT1A1 inhibition is expected by FTC and TAF.

However, the lack of significant changes on PD parameters (plasma glucose, active glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and lactate levels) brings a reassuring information and could allow to conclude that no dose adjustment of metformin is needed when it is combined with B/F/TAF.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of serum proteins on BIC</head><p>The antiviral EC50 of BIC was determined in MT-2 cells in the presence of two key human serum components, human serum albumin (HSA) and α1-acid glycoprotein (α1-AGP) or in the presence of complete human serum.</p><p>The presence of the two serum components reduced the antiviral activity of BIC by 20-fold, compared to 11-fold reduction of the potency of DTG. These data indicate that the two tested components of human serum are capable of binding BIC as well as DTG.</p><p>In the presence of human serum, the shift in EC50 for both BIC and DTG exhibited similar trends as observed with the serum protein components: the BIC EC50 value, extrapolated to 100% human serum, shifted 74-fold and was comparable to the 39-fold shift extrapolated for DTG.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.4.">Discussion on clinical pharmacology</head><p>The PK/PD properties of FTC and TAF have been evaluated throughout their respective development programs. Therefore, we will focus on discussing the BIC PK/PD properties as part of the B/F/TAF application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytical methods:</head><p>Analytical methods are well described and acceptable. In particular, analytical method validation for BIC in plasma for the main studies was provided. PK parameters calculation was classical and well explained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bioavailability:</head><p>The absorption of BIC in humans is expected to be &gt; 61% based on the results of the human ADME study in healthy subjects. This is not enough to classify BCS as a molecule with sufficient permeability (&gt;85% of absorption), therefore we disagree with the Applicant's suggestion that BIC be a BCS Class II compound, and we consider a BCS Class IV classification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bioequivalence and food effect:</head><p>Relative bioavailability study GS-US-141-1233 showed higher than expected BIC exposures when BIC GS-US-141-1233 showed that after a high-fat meal, BIC AUC and Cmax were increased by 1.24 and 1.13 fold, and after a moderate-fat meal, BIC AUC and Cmax were increased by 1.24 and 1.20 fold.</p><p>This food effect was larger with the 75 mg FDC (1.45 fold increase in AUC and 1.27 fold increase in Cmax). GS-US-141-1218 also provided results on food effect of BIC alone, with the largest food effect:</p><p>Cmax increased 2 fold and AUCs 1.8 fold after a high-fat meal. However, given the efficacy and PK values (and notably IQ values) of B/F/TAF administered with or without food in the Phase 3 studies, there is no evidence of loss of efficacy when B/F/TAF is administered without food.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metabolism:</head><p>BIC has three stereo-centres and is produced as a single stereoisomer, but stability data and routine manufacturing data did not show a risk of epimerization. Therefore, there is no risk of inter-conversion.</p><p>M20 (hydroxy-BIC-sulphate) and M15 (BIC-glucuronide) were the major metabolites identified in plasma. Considering the high proportion of M20 (&gt;20%), further in-vitro interaction studies are needed notably on the effect of M20 on CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2B6, 2D6 and transporters, such as P-gp and BCRP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PK in subjects with impaired renal function:</head><p>In subjects with severe renal impairment, BIC AUC and Cmax were decreased by 0.73 and 0.80 fold respectively. This decrease of exposure seems paradoxical in case of renal impairment, and was unexpected given the PK profile of BIC (renal excretion of intact bictegravir is a minor pathway, ~1% of dose). However, unbound BIC exposure was similar between the 2 groups. As explained by the Applicant, the fractions of BIC plasma protein binding in individual subjects overlapped between the 2 groups, with the percentages of unbound plasma BIC ranging from 0.43% to 0.63%, except in 1 subject with severe renal impairment. This subject showed an unexpectedly higher percentage of unbound plasma BIC (2.28%), which may have led to lower BIC exposure and shorter BIC half-life compared with the other subjects in the study, despite no medical history or concomitant medications explaining this anomaly. When data from this subject were excluded, GLSM ratios for AUClast, AUCinf, and Cmax were 87.44%, 87.51%, and 90.12%, respectively, when subjects with severe renal impairment were compared with subjects with normal renal function. The lack of clinical relevance of such BIC decrease of exposure is endorsed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PK in subjects with impaired hepatic function:</head><p>In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, BIC AUC and C max were decreased by 0.58 and 0.63 fold respectively. This decrease of exposure seems paradoxical in case of hepatic impairment, notably</p><p>given that BIC is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism.</p><p>The higher percentage of unbound fraction of BIC in subjects with hepatic impairment may be due to the decreased production of albumin in these subjects, resulting in lower plasma protein binding of BIC, which is highly protein bound. Additionally, the lack of an exposure-efficacy relationship for BIC over an IQ range of 4.7 to 40.1 following administration of B/F/TAF in the Phase 3 clinical studies confirms that this small decrease in BIC exposure in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment is not deemed significant. In accordance to the Applicant, the small difference in free BIC exposure is not clinically relevant, and subjects with moderate hepatic impairment may take B/F/TAF with or without food.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interactions</head><p>In vitro, BIC is a substrate of UGT1A1, CYP3A4, P-gp and BCRP. BIC is not a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3. BIC is a weak CYP3A4, OCT2 and MATE1 inhibitor, and has demonstrated in vitro inducing effect on CYP3A4, 2B6, P-gp and UGT1A1, without relevant clinical consequences in vivo. BIC is not expected to affect exposure of drugs the metabolism of which is UGT1A1-dependant. In vitro, BIC is not an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, OATP1B1, 1B3, OCT1, OAT1.</p><p>In study GS-US-380-3908 (ddi metformin), B/F/TAF significantly increases metformin AUC τ about 39%</p><p>with an 90%CI [131%-148]. Beyond the PD effect of metformin regardless the HIV patient status, the safety profile of the biguanide could be impacted due to renal impaired function that frequently occurs in HIV-and diabetic patients. In this clinical situation, metformin exposure could be more pronounced increasing the risk of metformin related adverse events. Caution, and eventually a dose adjustment is, then, advised in patients having a moderate renal function.</p><p>When B/F/TAF is given simultaneously with antacids under fasted conditions, BIC AUC and C24h substantially decrease, more than with rifampicin, about 79%. This interaction can be compensated by staggering the administration of BIC 2 hours before antacids. When administered 2 hours after, about a half of BIC exposure decreases, in a same magnitude as rifabutin combination. Consequently, B/F/TAF should not begiven simultaneously and in fasted conditions with magnesium or aluminiumcontaining antacids; B/F/TAF is recommended 2 hours before, or with food 2 hours after magnesium or aluminium-containing antacids.</p><p>No DDI study has been performed on the effect of H2-antagonists (e.g. ranitidine) or proton-pump .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacodynamics/antiviral activity:</head><p>The antiviral properties of BIC and DTG were compared.</p><p>In vitro data suggest that BIC is better than RAL and EVG and at least equivalent to DTG in terms of antiviral activity and resistance profile. In addition, some particularities might contribute to improve its properties against HIV strains with INSTI-RAM:</p><p>BIC has a longer dissociation T1/2 from HIV-1 integrase/DNA complexes than DTG, which may be associated to a higher barrier to resistance.</p><p>The antiviral activity of BIC against several HIV strains with INSTI-RAM is at least similar to DTG but also less impacted than DTG by some primary mutations (notably for the mutations G140S + Q148R ± additional INSTI mutation).</p><p>On the other hand, a study has shown a higher level of resistance to BIC (susceptibility decreased by 44-fold) than DTG (susceptibility decreased by 26-fold) with the mutations T66I + E138K + Q148K.</p><p>Finally, because BIC and F/TAF have a high genetic barrier to the development of resistance, the emergence of resistance with the combination B/F/TAF is expected to be low in clinical practice.</p><p>Overall, despite pharmacodynamics properties, the clinical development of BIC has been confined to patients with viral strains not harbouring INSTI-R. As for DTG, if BIC were to be developed in patients with INSTI-R testing a higher dose would have to be considered.</p></div>

Once-daily doses of single-agent BIC (5, 25, 50, or 100 mg) administered for 10 days were also well tolerated, and led to dose-dependent decreases in HIV-1 viral load: The plasma exposure-response relationship was well characterized by an E max model. Inhibitory quotient (IQ) was estimated by dividing pre-dose concentration on Day 11 (C tau ) by the in vitro protein-adjusted concentration that results in 95% inhibition (paIC95, 162 ng/mL -from study PC-141-2032). BIC doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg once daily yielded median protein-adjusted IQ of 95% (paIQ95) values of 4.9, 13.4, and 25.9, respectively. Based on PK/PD analyses, exposure associated with a 75 mg dose of single agent BIC is expected to provide near-maximal virologic response, with a predicted paIQ95 of approximately 20, providing considerable coverage above the target concentration of 162 ng/mL (paIC95).</p><p>The Phase 2 safety and efficacy study GS-US-141-1475 was a randomized, double-blinded study of the safety and efficacy of BIC 75 mg + F/TAF versus DTG 50 mg + F/TAF in HIV-1 infected antiretroviral treatment-naive adults.

P-value for the superiority test comparing the percentages of subjects with HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL between treatment groups was from the CMH test stratified by baseline HIV-1 RNA stratum (&lt;= 100,000 vs. &gt; 100,000 copies/mL) and region stratum (US vs. ex-US).</p><p>The difference in percentages of subjects with HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL between treatment groups and its 95% CI was calculated based on the MH proportion adjusted by baseline HIV-1 RNA stratum (&lt;= 100,000 vs. &gt; 100,000 copies/mL) and region stratum (US vs. ex-US). Of note, the comparison with DTG is done in TN and in virologically suppressed patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.3.">Discussion on clinical efficacy</head><p>Although a more stringent 10% non-inferiority margin would have been regarded as more appropriate than the 12% selected margin for the studies performed in ART-naïve subjects, ultimately results are overall compatible with a more stringent non inferiority margin.</p><p>In these pivotal studies, enrolled subjects are predominantly white homosexual men with unaltered immune function and asymptomatic HIV infection, as for main of the Phase 3 studies in HIV clinical studies. The proportion of women and ART-naïve subjects with VL &gt;100,000 c/mL is low (10-15%) but an additional switch study only performed in women confirms this non-inferiority.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy data and additional analyses</head><p>The short-term monotherapy study suggested that 100 mg bictegravir might be slightly better than 50 mg. The Applicant initially chose 75 mg primarily based on the Emax model. Then, the dose of bictegravir was subsequently lowered to 50 mg when bictegravir was incorporated into the FDC with FTC and TAF based on PK data.</p><p>While it is clear that the BIC dose was to be different as part of the FDC vs outside the FDC, there might still be some room for maximizing the dose. Nevertheless, it can ultimately be acknowledged that the dose as selected has enabled to achieve non-inferiority of B/F/TAF vs DTG+2 NRTIs. However, it is expected that higher BIC dose would be required in the context of INI-RAM emergence.</p><p>Overall, the efficacy endpoints support the non-inferiority of B/F/TAF compared to DTG-based regimen (FTC/TAF or ABC/3TC) in ART-naïve subjects and when switching from such regimen in virologically suppressed subjects. These results are supported by the Per Protocol analyses and other secondary endpoints, especially the changes from baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4 cell count. In addition, the switch to B/F/TAF is non-inferior to the continuation of a DRV-or ATV-based regimen. This is consistent with the known efficacy of DTG in comparison to PI. The rates of virological success or lack of efficacy with B/F/TAF are consistent with the historical data from F/TAF-studies.</p><p>In the Phase 3 studies comparing B/F/TAF vs DTG+F/TAF or ABC/DTG/3TC in ART-naïve subjects, there is a trend for lower response rate in the subgroup of patients with high viral load (&gt;100,000 c/ml) treated with B/F/TAF. It is noteworthy that given that ABC/3TC is somewhat regarded as not maximizing efficacy in patients with high viral load, the trend for higher efficacy of DTG was more pronounced when DTG was combined with the same backbone as for BIC (i.e. FTAF) than when DTG was combined with ABC-3TC. Given that the subgroup of patients with high viral load is regarded as discriminatory, the results in patients with high viral load might translate a somewhat lower performance of BIC as compared to DTG which might be related to a non-maximized dose of BIC.</p><p>While it can be acknowledged that in the subgroup of patients with adherence &lt;95% the trend favouring dolutegravir might be driven by the missing data rather than virologic failure (which would otherwise have argued that limited adherence might be more pejorative for bictegravir than dolutegravir), this is not the case for the overall analysis in patients with high viral load. Overall, the trend in favour of dolutegravir in patients with high viral load as reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC.</p><p>In studies GS-US-380-1490 (B/F/TAF vs DTG+F/TAF in ART-naïve subjects) and GS-US-380-1844 (B/F/TAF vs ABC/DTG/3TC in virologically suppressed subjects), there is a slightly higher rate of subjects who discontinued from B/F/TAF treatment due to adverse events, although not statistically significant. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Control Group Studies</head><p>Hepatic AEs No clinically relevant median changes from baseline were observed in alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, or total bilirubin for the B/F/TAF or comparator group in any of the Phase 3 studies. Transaminase elevations were reported in a higher proportion in virologically suppressed subjects who switched treatment to B/F/TAF than in subjects in the comparator groups. However, these transaminase elevations were mainly Grade 1 or 2, resolved without B/F/TAF discontinuation and were not associated with AEs.</p><p>Graded total bilirubin increases occurred in a higher percentage of subjects treated with B/F/TAF than the comparator in Studies GS-US-380-1489, GS-US-380-1490, and GS-US-380-1844; however, the increases were primarily Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity and were not associated with hepatic AEs or other liver-related laboratory abnormalities.</p><p>The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent liver-related laboratory abnormalities was comparable between treatment groups within each Phase 3 study and within the pooled analysis (with the exception of total bilirubin in Study GS-US-380-1878, due to ATV treatment in some subjects in the SBR group).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bone safety</head><p>B/F/TAF demonstrated a bone safety profile comparable with that of ABC/DTG/3TC, a regimen that is not associated with bone toxicity. In both ART-naive (study GS-US-380-1489) and virologically suppressed subjects (GS-US-380-1844), mean (SD) percentage changes from baseline in hip and spine BMD were comparable between the B/F/TAF and ABC/DTG/3TC treatment groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ocular safety</head><p>Overall, the incidence of AEs in the eye disorders SOC and the incidence of AEs potentially related to uveitis were low and comparable between treatment groups in the 4 Phase 3 B/F/TAF studies.</p><p>Clinically, none of the AEs potentially related to uveitis were considered representative of an actual case of posterior uveitis.  higher rates of minor transaminase increases were observed in the B/F/TAF groups than in the DTGcontaining groups, but were not considered clinically significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety in special populations</head><p>The AE profile for subjects receiving B/F/TAF was not affected by sex, age and race.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Renal impairment</head><p>In study GS-US-141-1479, BIC 75 mg was administered in subjects with severe impaired renal function (n=10) compared with control subjects with normal renal function (n=8). One AE in each renal function group was considered related to study drug by the investigator (nausea in a subject with severe renal impairment and headache in a subject with normal renal function).

Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects of BIC, FTC, or TAF with respect to pregnancy, embryonal and fetal development, parturition, or postnatal development.</p><p>B/F/TAF should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. No clinically relevant concerns are apparent from review of available pregnancy data in clinical studies (11 pregnancies reported in the Phase 3 studies, including 5 subjects treated with B/F/TAF) or from Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) data for FTC and from the limited data for TAF.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.1.">Discussion on clinical safety</head><p>As expected, the safety profile of B/F/TAF is similar to DTG+FTC/TAF. The more frequent AEs are gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting), headache, fatigue and insomnia (&lt;5% of subjects). It has to be underlined that only 48 weeks data from the ongoing longer term pivotal phase 3 studies have been made available.</p><p>The relevant aspects of the safety profile of B/F/TAF are:</p><p>Hepatotoxicity: Although no liver hypersensitivity reaction or severe drug-induced liver occurred in subjects treated with B/F/TAF, higher rates of transaminases elevations and hyperbilirubinemia were observed compared to DTG-based regimen. These elevations were mild and transient. Considering the available data in monkeys which showed bile duct hyperplasia a at the higher doses of B tested (1000 mg/kg/day) not always reversible and the cases of increased ALT activities also reported at the highest doses and the potential competition of B for the UGT1A1 enzyme with unconjugated bilirubin, the risk of hepatobiliary disorders is a potential concern for bictegravir-containing regimen. Of note, an amendment to the study protocols GS-US-380-1489 and GS-US-380-1844 was made to include recommendations for the management of potential hepatobiliary toxicity. The recommendation was to highlight the potential hepatobiliary toxicity of bictegravir based on data available in monkeys at the highest dose tested (biliary hyperplasia and hepatocyte hypertrophy) and that further investigations might be necessary in case of signs/ laboratory abnormalities suggestive of hepatobiliary disorders.</p><p>Hepatotoxicity will be actively monitored through PSURs.</p><p>Renal disorders: as DTG, BIC also increases serum creatinine level within the first weeks of treatment and remained stable thereafter, due to the inhibition of the transporters OCT2 and MATE-1. This is not considered to be clinically relevant since do not reflect a change in glomerular filtration rate, but should be considered for the biological monitoring of renal impaired subjects treated with B/F/TAF. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.">Disease or condition</head><p>While untreated HIV-1 infection remains a life threatening disease, for years it has become a chronic disease with combined antiretroviral therapy being early introduced to prevent pejorative impact of immune deficiency (notably including opportunistic infections in patients with CD4&lt;200/mm3).</p><p>The goal of ARV therapy for HIV-1 infection is to delay disease progression and prolong survival by achieving maximal and durable suppression of HIV-1 replication. Thanks to combined antiretroviral therapies nowadays available high level of viral suppression (&gt;85% of patients with HIV RNA &lt;50 copies/ml) can be achieved in HIV infected patients.</p><p>B/F/TAF is indicated for the treatment of adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) without any known mutations associated with resistance to the individual components. B/F/TAF is a FDC combining a novel INSTI, bictegravir (BIC), with the backbone emtricitabine (F)/tenofovir Assessment report EMA/293559/2018 Page 99/104 alafenamide (TAF), already available as Descovy. Therefore, no other ARV are expected to be coadministered with B/F/TAF, considered as a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. B/F/TAF is intended to be administered in subjects infected with HIV-1 without any known mutations associated with resistance to the individual components (i.e. including patients in first line treatment and virologically supressed patients).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">Available therapies and unmet medical need</head><p>Multiple therapeutic options have become available over time notably in first line therapy. Other STR are already available on the market for first line therapy, combining 2 NRTI s + 1 NNRTI, 1 INSTI or 1 boosted-PI.</p><p>Overall, B/F/TAF is not aimed at responding to an unmet medical need, but rather as an alternative options to other first line antiretroviral regimens.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3.">Main clinical studies</head><p>The clinical development of B/F/TAF is supported by 4 Phase 3 studies performed in ART-naïve subjects (GS-US-380-1489 and GS-US-380-1490) or virologically-suppressed subjects (GS-US-380-1844 and GS-US-380-1878) and a small underpowered phase 2 study GS-US-1475 in treatment naïve. In studies GS-US-380-1489, GS-US-380-1490 and GS-US-380-1844 the comparator was a dolutegravirbased regimen which is relevant given its potency and its wide use in clinical practice (through ABC/DTG/3TC). Study GS-US-380-1878 is aimed at substantiating the switch to Protease inhibitor (PI) based regimen. The design and methodology of these studies are endorsed (non-inferiority with standard primary endpoints).</p><p>In addition, the bioequivalence study GS-US-141-1233 is pivotal for the selection of a bictegravir dose as part of the FDC. Indeed, it was shown that a higher exposure of BIC was observed when BIC 75 mg was contained within the FDC as compared to BIC 75 mg+FTAF leading to select 50 mg of BIC for the FDC. The selected regimen of the FDC (BIC 50mg) FTAF is a once daily regimen with or without food as tested in the phase III studies.</p><p>It is important to underline that the clinical development of BIC encompassed patients without viral strains harbouring INSTI-RAM, despite its similarly enhanced pharmacodynamics properties as compared to other INSTI. A higher BIC dose (75 mg) might have to be considered in such situation.</p><p>BIC-FTAF targets first line and virologically suppressed patients without viral strains harbouring mutations of resistance to any components of the FDC and to the INI class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Favourable effects</head><p>Overall, the efficacy endpoints support the non-inferiority of B/F/TAF compared to DTG-based regimen (FTC/TAF or ABC/3TC) in ART-naïve subjects and when switching from such regimen in virologically suppressed subjects. These results are supported by the Per Protocol analyses and other secondary endpoints, especially the changes from baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4 cell count. In addition, the switch to B/F/TAF is non-inferior to the continuation of a DRV-or ATV-based regimen. This is consistent with the known efficacy of DTG in comparison to PI. High level of virologic suppression is achieved and in the B/F/TAF groups and the DTG-based regimen groups, no subject developed treatment-emergent resistance to any study drug.</p><p>In ART-naïve subjects, B/F/TAF is non-inferior to DTG-based regimen (primary endpoint: percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 c/mL at Week 48 non inferiority margin of 12%; difference in Assessment report EMA/293559/2018 Page 100/104 percentages: -0.6% [-4.8% to 3.6%] vs ABC/DTG/3TC; -3.5% [-7.9% to 1.0%] vs DTG+F/TAF).</p><p>While disputable 12% large non inferiority margin was selected, results are compatible with more stringent margin.</p><p>In virologically-suppressed subjects (primary endpoint: percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 c/mL at Week 48, non-inferiority margin of 4%), B/F/TAF is non-inferior to ABC/DTG/3TC (difference in percentages: 0.7% [-1.0% to 2.8%]) and PI-based regimen (difference in percentages: 0.0% [-2.5% to 2.5%]).</p><p>The efficacy results were similar between the treatment groups for all of the subgroups analysed (by age, sex, race, baseline CD4 cell count, region and study drug adherence).</p><p>Adherence is required to prevent loss of virologic suppression and potential development of drug resistance. The adherence to ARV regimen is expected to be improved by reducing the pill burden and dosing frequency. Thus, the use of this once-daily single-tablet regimen such as B/F/TAF is expected to favour adherence and consequently optimise virologic outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects</head><p>In the Phase 3 studies comparing B/F/TAF vs DTG+F/TAF or ABC/DTG/3TC in ART-naïve subjects, there is a trend for lower response rate in the subgroup of patients with high viral load (&gt;100,000 c/ml) treated with B/F/TAF. It is noteworthy that given that ABC/3TC is somewhat regarded as not maximizing efficacy in patients with high viral load, the trend for higher efficacy of DTG was more pronounced when DTG was combined with the same backbone as for BIC (i.e. FTAF) than when DTG was combined with ABC-3TC. Given that the subgroup of patients with high viral load is regarded as discriminatory, the results in patients with high viral load might translate a somewhat lower performance of BIC as compared to DTG which might be related to a non-maximized dose of BIC. The results of the subgroup analyses in patients with high viral load at baseline are reflected in section 5.1.</p><p>Due to the high level of virologic suppression achieved the resistance pattern of BIC remains to be established. Possibility of rescue therapy with dolutegravir (with higher dose for INSTI-R strain) is unlikely given the overlap of resistance profile, but there are several options for rescue therapy with other cARTs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Unfavourable effects</head><p>The safety profile of B/F/TAF appears similar to that DTG+F/TAF. The more frequent AEs are gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting), headache, fatigue and insomnia (&lt;5% of subjects). The rates of Grade 3 or 4 related AE and AE leading to discontinuation are low (≤ 2%).</p><p>No liver hypersensitivity reaction or severe drug-induced liver were observed, but the rates of transaminases elevations and hyperbilirubinemia were higher with B/F/TAF compared to DTG-based regimen. These elevations were mainly minor and transient.</p><p>Similarly to DTG, increases of creatinine level were observed within the first weeks of treatment by B/F/TAF. These increases remained stable thereafter and are due to the inhibition of the transporters OCT2 and MATE-1. There was no relevant renal AE, including tubulopathy.</p><p>Psychiatric disorders are a class-effect of integrase inhibitors and therefore were scrutinized within B/F/TAF application. The rate of suicide events is ≈ 1% across the different studies and is not different between B/F/TAF and DTG groups. Most subjects with a suicide-related AE while receiving B/F/TAF had a history of depression or mental illness. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects</head><p>Only 48 weeks data from the ongoing longer term pivotal phase 3 studies have been made available which carries some level of uncertainties on the long term safety of bictegravir Given the non-clinical findings in favour of hepatobiliary impact [based on data available in monkeys at the highest dose tested (biliary hyperplasia and hepatocyte hypertrophy]), and the particular awareness of physicians through a dedicated amendment across the clinical studies to recommend further investigations in case of signs/ laboratory abnormalities suggestive of hepatobiliary disorders (notably appropriate imaging consultation with a specialist), such a safety issue should be kept under scrutiny for the future use of the drug in the real life setting.</p><p>Moreover, as for other TAF containing regimen, attention of physicians should be warranted on the potential risk of nephrotoxicity resulting from chronic exposure to low levels of tenofovir. </p></div>

Bictegravir inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the integrase active site and blocking the strand transfer step of retroviral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integration which is essential for the HIV replication cycle, demonstrating high potency and selectivity in antiviral assays. Bictegravir displays a high resistance barrier and has an improved phenotypic resistance profile compared to dolutegravir (DTG), raltegravir (RAL) and elvitegravir (EVG; E). Bictegravir has a longer dissociation half-life from both wild-type and mutant HIV-1 integrase/DNA complexes compared with DTG, RAL, and EVG.</figDesc></figure>

Intracellularly, FTC is phosphorylated by enzymes to form emtricitabine triphosphate (FTC-TP), the active metabolite.Emtricitabine is an NRTI that has activity against HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Following absorption, FTC is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to emtricitabine triphosphate (FTC-TP), the active metabolite, an analog of 2'-deoxycytidine triphosphate. Emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase through high-affinity binding, competing with the natural substrate 2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate. Emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate is efficiently incorporated into the nascent viral DNA chain by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase resulting in termination of DNA synthesis due to the lack of a hydroxyl group at the 3'-position of the sugar moiety of FTC, which in turn inhibits viral replication. In a clinical study, the intracellular half-life of FTC-TP in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was 39 hours. Intracellular triphosphate levels increased with dose but reached a plateau at doses of 200 mg or greater. Emtricitabine has activity against retroviruses and hepadnaviruses.</figDesc></figure>

Combinations of these agents in cell-based in vitro assays show favourable anti-HIV activity and no evidence for antagonism. The anti-HIV-1 activity of 3-drug combination of BIC, FTC, and TAF was found to be highly synergistic with no evidence of antagonism in vitro, supporting the use of these agents in combination in HIV-1 infected patients. The resistance profiles of the individual agents BIC, FTC, and TAF are distinct and nonnovel strand transfer inhibitor of HIV-1 integrase with high potency and selectivity in antiviral assays and does not require metabolic modification to exert ARV activity. Using lymphoblastoid T-cell lines and primary human T-lymphocytes in HIV-1 antiviral assays, the estimated concentration of drug for a half-maximal response (EC50) of BIC ranged from 1.5 to 2.4 nM and the selectivity indices ranged from 1500 to 8800. When tested in primary human PBMCs against clinical isolates of all HIV-1 groups (M, N, O), including subtypes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, BIC displayed similar antiviral activity across all clinical isolates with mean and median EC50 values of 0.60 and 0.55 nM, respectively, based on a range of EC50 values between &lt; 0.05 and 1.71 nM. HIV-2 was similarly susceptible to BIC with an EC50 value of 1.1 nM.

Inhibitory Activity in HIV-1 Integrase Strand Transfer and 3'-Processing Assays a The data represent the mean ± SD of 3 independent experiments done in triplicates. b The data represent the mean ± SD of 5 independent experiments done in triplicates. c Maximum inhibition was determined by curve fitting.Thus, the integration of HIV in cell was inhibited. This inhibition of HIV-1 DNA integration was evaluated by assessing the quantity of aborted circular HIV DNA species containing 1 or 2 long terminal repeats (2-LTR circles), as well as the quantity of authentic HIV-1 integration products in infected MT-2 cells. BIC enhanced the accumulation of 2-LTR circles, a product of integration failure. BIC profoundly decreased integration junctions but did not affect viral DNA synthesis as measured by the late reverse transcription products, demonstrating an authentic inhibition of HIV-1 integration. As expected, DTG exhibited a similar effect on the integration junctions.The dissociation kinetics of 3 H-labelled INSTIs BIC, DTG, RAL, and EVG were measured using wild-type HIV integrase/DNA complexes and a scintillation proximity assay. By both data analysis methods, BIC had a longer dissociation half-life from HIV-1 integrase/DNA complexes compared to DTG, RAL, and EVG; the long dissociation half-life has been proposed to contribute to a high barrier to resistance.Against HIVUsing lymphoblastoid T-cell lines and primary human T-lymphocytes in HIV-1 antiviral assays, the estimated concentration of drug for half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of BIC ranged from 1.5 to 2.4 nM and the selectivity indices ranged from 1500 to 8800.When tested in primary human PBMCs against clinical isolates of all HIV-1 groups (M, N, O), including subtypes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, BIC displayed similar antiviral activity across all clinical isolates with mean and median EC50 values of 0.60 and 0.55 nM, respectively, based on a range of EC50 values between &lt; 0.05 and 1.71 nM.

Therefore as per ICH Q6A, testing for polymorphic form at release is not necessary. Development data demonstrate the absence of indicator organisms and</figDesc><table /><note>The synthetic process results in the stereoselective formation of an intermediate and thus the formation of the desired emtricitabine enantiomer. Five manufacturing sites are involved. Adequate in- process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. The process has been shown to consistently produce emtricitabine that meets the required quality standards. The active substance is packaged in double polyethylene (PE) bags inside HDPE drums which comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended.Specification Emtricitabine specification includes tests and limits for appearance (visual), identification (IR, HPLC), clarity of solution (visual), water content (Ph. Eur.), enantiomeric purity (chiral HPLC), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC), and particle size (Laser Light Scattering). Analytical methods have been validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.therefore, as per ICH Q6, microbial testing of the active substance is not required.Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay testing has been presented.</note></figure>

HIV-1 isolates selected by TAF expressed a K65R mutation in HIV-1 RT; in addition, a K70E mutation in HIV-1 RT has been transiently observed[Margot 2006]. HIV-1 isolates with the K65R mutation have low-level reduced susceptibility to abacavir, FTC, TFV, and lamivudine (LAM)[Kagan 2007, Margot 2006].

[14C]TAF was rapidly excreted within 24 hours after oral dosing in bile duct-intact and BDC male SD rats. The mean values of 71.9 and 22.2% of the administered radioactivity were excreted in faeces and urine, respectively, by 168 hours post-dose. In dogs the excretion of [14C]TAF was determined after administration of a single 15-mg/kg oral dose of 14C-TAF to bile duct-intact and BDC male dogs. [14C]TAF was readily excreted mostly within 48 hours after oral dosing. The mean values of 37.4% and 35.9% of the administered radioactivity were excreted in faeces and urine, respectively, by 168 hours post-dose. Mean values of 2.11% and 14.0% of the administered radioactivity were excreted in bile in rat and dog, respectively, through 168 hours post-dose. Excretion to milk: The extent of TFV excretion in lactating monkeys was evaluated. Milk was obtained from 2 lactating adult female rhesus monkeys following a single 30 mg/kg subcutaneous dose of TFV (Study No. P2000116). TFV was detected in the milk, the AUC in milk was between 18.6-21.5% of that seen in plasma. The toxicological profiles of BIC, FTC and TAF have been evaluated in a comprehensive set of nonclinical studies where the compounds have been evaluated separately. The performed studies include repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 6 months in rodents and 9 months in a non-rodent species, in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, male and female fertility and early embryonic development in rodent, embryo-foetal development toxicity, peri-and post-natal development studies in rodents, phototoxicity studies.No new single dose toxicity studies have been conducted, namely, no studies using bictegravir or the bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide combination. Studies conducted with emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil and tenofovir alafenamide, administered separately, revealed no risks of acute toxicity. The lack of dedicated single dose toxicity studies with bictegravir was considered acceptable.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Single dose toxicity</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>2.3.3.

The rate of suicide events is ~1% across the different study groups, and seems not increased with B/F/TAF compared to the other INSTI. However, considering the limited number of patients included in all the studies, it is difficult to draw any conclusion. At least, the level of risk might be similar with BIC than with DTG. Outside the suicide events, a number of other psychiatric AEs have been reported with B/F/TAF. Based on the data provided on psychiatric disorders, 1/3 of patients included in the pivotal studies had "medical history of psychiatric disorders". Overall, similar patterns of psychiatric disorders (qualitative and quantitative aspects) were observed in comparative studies versus DTG.
