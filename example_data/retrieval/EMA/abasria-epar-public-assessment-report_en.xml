<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Introduction Problem statement</head><p>Diabetes mellitus is widely recognized as one of the leading causes of death and disability globally. The</p><p>International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimates that more than 371 million adults worldwide have diabetes and that number is projected to increase to 552 million by 2030 (IDF Diabetes Atlas 2012a; IDF Diabetes Atlas 2012b). Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces, resulting in hyperglycaemia. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) results from pancreatic islet cell destruction most commonly by an autoimmune process. It is a disorder in which circulating insulin is virtually absent, plasma glucagon is elevated, and the pancreatic ß cells fail to respond. Patients are prone to developing ketoacidosis and require exogenous insulin replacement. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a heterogeneous disorder most commonly associated with insulin resistance in the presence of an associated impairment in insulin secretion. Type 2 diabetes mellitus results from relative insulin deficiency, a mismatch between insulin production and insulin requirements, which is in contrast to the absolute insulin deficiency of patients with T1DM. Insulin is considered the most effective treatment to lower high blood glucose (BG) and is indicated for patients with T1DM and for patients with T2DM, if adequate glycaemic control cannot be achieved through diet, exercise, or other antidiabetes medication. Tight glycaemic control is recommended for most patients with diabetes mellitus to reduce the risk of chronic complications of the disease, and insulin's role in achieving this is well-recognized (DCCT/EDIC 2005).</p><p>Long-acting insulin analogues, such as insulin glargine, provide smooth, peakless basal insulin profiles, resulting in a glycaemic profile more similar to normal physiology, potentially enabling patients to achieve normal BG levels. Clinical evidence to date suggests that a long-acting insulin analogue, such as insulin glargine, may provide benefits over prior agents such as neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH), including reduced frequency of nocturnal hypoglycaemia, better fasting BG control, and improved quality of life when compared with traditional insulins in patients with either T1DM or T2DM <ref type="bibr">(Pieber et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ratner et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rosenstock et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yki-Jarvinen et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schober et al. 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Insulin glargine was first authorised in the EU on 9 June 2000 under the name of Lantus. It is currently approved for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>About the product</head><p>Abasria (LY2963016) was submitted as a biosimilar, with Lantus (insulin glargine [rDNA origin] injection) as the chosen reference medicinal product. The reference medicinal product has been marketed in the European Union for over 10 years. Lantus 100 unit / ml solution for injection was first authorised in the EU on 9 June 2000 (MA:</p><p>EMEA/H/C/000284); the Marketing Authorisation Holder is Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH.</p><p>The primary amino acid sequence of LY2963016 is the same as that of the active ingredient in Lantus. Abasria has the same pharmaceutical form and strength as Lantus. Abasria differs from the reference medicinal product with respect to excipients used in the formulation: zinc oxide replaces zinc chloride and Abasria uses 100% glycerol compared with 85% in the reference medicinal product. However, the final quantitative formulation is the same as that of the reference medicinal product.</p><p>Abasria (LY2963016) is a long-acting insulin analogue administered as a subcutaneous injection for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It will be made available in 2 presentations: a 3 mL cartridge, Assessment report EMA/CHMP/340840/2014 Page 9/65 for delivery by a compatible CE-marked reusable pen injector, and also the same 3 mL cartridge sealed in a prefilled pen injector (KwikPen). The pen injectors differ from those available to administer Lantus cartridges, but are appropriate for use with Lilly insulin cartridges. The pack sizes also differ.</p><p>The proposed therapeutic indication and posology for LY2963016 are identical to those for Lantus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The development programme</head><p>The clinical development programme of LY2963016 has specifically considered the EU guidelines for similar biological medicinal products and also indication-specific guidelines (see list below).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Guideline Document Reference Topic</head><p>Guideline Although the planning phase of the clinical development programme was completed before the draft guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing recombinant human insulin and insulin analogues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005) was published, the clinical programme is broadly in accordance with the principles of this document. During the development of LY2963016 the applicant sought scientific advice at the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in July 2011. The scientific advice procedures covered questions on the pharmaceutical quality, the non-clinical and clinical programme. Broadly, the Scientific Advice recommendations were followed by the applicant and the development has followed a stepwise approach in demonstrating the comparability with the reference medicinal product.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Quality aspects</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Introduction</head><p>Abasria (LY2963016) has the same pharmaceutical form and strength as the reference medicinal product Lantus.</p><p>It is supplied as a sterile solution for subcutaneous injection. The intended commercial formulation is presented in 3 mL glass cartridges. Each mL of Abasria (insulin glargine injection) contains 100 units of insulin glargine, zinc (zinc oxide), metacresol, glycerol and water for injection, as well as hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide (used for pH adjustment). It will be made available in 2 presentations: a 3 mL cartridge, for delivery by a compatible CE-marked reusable pen injector, and the same 3 mL cartridge sealed in a prefilled pen injector Assessment report EMA/CHMP/340840/2014 Page 10/65 <ref type="bibr">(KwikPen)</ref>. The pen injectors differ from those available to administer Lantus cartridges, but are appropriate for use with Lilly insulin cartridges.</p><p>Overall clinical lots representing two different presentations of LY2963016 finished product produced using the same active substance process material, were used in the clinical program. Both finished product presentations used the same formulation, which was filled into 3 mL cartridges (manufactured at Lilly, France) or 10 mL vials (manufactured at Lilly, Indianapolis).</p><p>A comparability exercise has been performed for the proposed LY2963016 biosimilar product with the reference medicinal product, EU-approved Lantus. Data generated with US-approved Lantus has also been presented and is considered supportive.</p><p>Although this dossier is not considered a Quality by Design application, certain elements of an enhanced approached were applied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Active Substance</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General information</head><p>Abasria is formulated from LY2963016 active substance, which is also referred to in the dossier as basal insulin analogue V (BIV). LY2963016 is a two-chain peptide containing 53 amino acids; a 21 amino acid A-chain and a 32 amino acid B-chain that are non-glycosylated.</p><p>LY2963016 (INN: insulin glargine) differ from human insulin by the addition of 2 arginine residues to the C-terminus of the B-chain and the replacement of the asparagine at position A21 with a glycine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1: Primary Structure of LY2963016</head><p>These changes shift the isoelectric point such that the analogue is soluble at an acidic pH, but less soluble at neutral physiological pH. Once injected, the insulin analogue precipitates in the neutral pH environment of the subcutaneous injection site, delaying absorption and prolonging the duration-of-action without a pronounced peak in the time action profile. In vivo, the 2 arginines are cleaved and the molecule interacts with the native insulin receptor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacture, characterisation and process controls</head><p>LY2963016 is produced in transformed Escherichia coli bacteria, and purified using established biotechnology purification procedures. Fermentation of E.coli transformed with the appropriate expression plasmid results in the expression of a pre-pro-protein. Granules of pre-pro-protein are then recovered from the fermentation broth by homogenising the cells prior to removal of cell debris/granule concentration by differential centrifugation.</p><p>After isolation, the product undergoes solubilisation and sulfitolysis (opening of disulphide bonds). The product is then re-folded to form a proinsulin-like intermediate with correct disulphide bonds. After re-folding the leader sequence is enzymatically removed. Finally, the active substance, LY2963016 (BIV) is formed by enzymatically removing the connecting peptide (C-peptide).</p><p>Subsequent chromatography steps are then employed to remove process and product-related impurities, before the active substance is crystallised, dried and filled into final containers.</p><p>LY2963016 active substance is filled in a glass bottle and plastic screw caps. The compatibility and the protection provided by the container closure system have been confirmed by the active substance stability data.</p><p>The manufacturing process is well described, and in general the process controls are appropriate.</p><p>Information has been provided for the laboratory, pilot and commercial scale operations used in manufacture of Abasria (LY2963016 insulin glargine), to demonstrate the validity of the models used at each of the process steps to determine the acceptance criteria for the manufacturing process. The applicant has provided justification for the claimed proven acceptable ranges (PAR), Critical Process Parameters, Acceptable Ranges for Operational Process Parameters and In-Process Controls, as well as the Normal Operating Ranges, based on laboratory/pilot scale, commercial scale. The application of measurement uncertainty (MU) has been clarified and the use of this to determine the operational PAR is endorsed. Some of the acceptance ranges have been tightened, based on the laboratory, pilot and commercial scale process validation data. This provides reassurance regarding the manufacturing process control.</p><p>The applicant has provided information from the process validation study to demonstrate that the loading targets in commercial scale for the Drum Thaw, Transformation and Crystallization are met. The applicant has confirmed that, at all steps, material is controlled within the established intermediate hold times.</p><p>The strategy for chromatography resin lifetime monitoring has been explained. Details of the output parameter ranges and actions if those ranges are exceeded have been given. Cleaning and storage details for the resins have also been provided.</p><p>Details of the shipping validation have been provided. This demonstrates that the active substance is maintained at less than -39°C, which is acceptable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Control of materials</head><p>The gene was designed with appropriate sequences for ligation into a platform expression plasmid backbone.</p><p>The plasmid was used to transform the E. coli host strain and a clonal recombinant derivative was used to produce the Master and Working Cell Banks.</p><p>The development of the transformed host strain and construction and control of the working and master cell banks is considered adequate. Details for stability testing of the MCB and WCB have been provided, including growth of thawed cells and characterisation to confirm retention of the plasmid. Restriction enzyme digest analysis is performed to confirm the correct plasmid banding pattern and the product identity is confirmed by testing the fermentation culture for potency of product intermediate. Growth data are compared with expected data and fermentation potency data used to demonstrate that the revived cells can be used to manufacture the desired product intermediate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacturing process development</head><p>Several active substance manufacturing processes have been utilised throughout LY2963016 development.</p><p>On the whole, comparability between clinically qualified material and proposed commercial material was demonstrated using extensive characterisation of active substance and finished product batches. Additional structural characterization data have been provided, with tests performed directly on active substance batches and some tests performed on finished product batches manufactured using active substance from the two processes and representing both finished product sites (contract manufacturer, USA and Lilly, France).</p><p>Comparability was demonstrated for primary structure, secondary structure, tertiary structure and quaternary structure. Stability data under both long term and accelerated conditions was also provided to support the comparability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characterisation</head><p>The structure of LY2963016 has been elucidated through detailed structural characterization of the primary reference standard and a commercial-scale finished product demonstration batch. Consistency with the expected LY2963016 amino acid sequence has been demonstrated. Higher order structural characterization has been demonstrated. Additional structural characterization data and biological potency data have been provided, with tests performed directly on active substance batches and some tests performed on finished product batches manufactured using active substance from the two processes and representing both finished product sites (contract manufacturer, USA and Lilly, France).</p><p>The biological activity has been characterised utilising several physiologically relevant assays.</p><p>LY2963016 related impurities that are seen in the final active substance were isolated and characterized.</p><p>Host cell proteins, proinsulin precursor, bacterial endotoxins, iron, and ethanol process related impurities are routinely tested against batch release specifications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specification</head><p>The control tests proposed for the active substance are considered appropriate to ensure sufficient quality with respect to identity, purity/impurities, potency and safety (microbial).</p><p>The potency assay is an HPLC method. The method has demonstrated specificity for LY2963016. The specification limit is consistent with the specification for total impurities and allows for assay variability. The assay quantifies mg of LY2963016 per mg of total solid and is corrected for any volatiles that may be present via the LOD method. The proposed limit is aligned with the human insulin active substance compendial and registered limits.</p><p>The bioidentity method for LY2963016 is a cell-based reporter gene assay.</p><p>The analytical procedures used to characterise and control LY2963016 quality are generally appropriate and validated.</p><p>Batch data has been presented for multiple validation batches. Data from the validation batches, clinical batches and primary stability batches are all comparable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability</head><p>The stability data presented support the proposed shelf-life of 30 months at -10°C. Nine months long term (-10°C) stability data are available for the Process validation and production lots of active substance. Six months accelerated (5°C) stability data are available. Based on stability data comparison, the commercial process and the process used to generate clinically qualified material are comparable in terms of long term (-10°C) and accelerated (5°C) stability.</p><p>Stress testing was also done to identify possible degradation pathways. Photostability studies were performed,</p><p>showing that LY2963016 is light sensitive and is therefore packaged to protect it from light.</p><p>In accordance with EU GMP guidelines 1 , any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparability exercise for Active Substance</head><p>Please refer to the section "comparability exercise for Finished Product" below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Finished Medicinal Product</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description of the product and pharmaceutical development</head><p>Abasria finished product will be made available in 2 presentations: a 3 mL cartridge, for delivery by a compatible CE-marked reusable pen injector and the same 3 mL cartridge sealed in a disposable prefilled pen injector (KwikPen). The glass cartridge has an elastomeric disc seal and plunger for administration via subcutaneous injection. The plungers and glass cartridges are siliconized.</p><p>Abasria is a clear and colorless solution. It is formulated so that LY2963016 active ingredient is at a concentration of 100 Units/mL. It contains no novel excipients. Excipients include glycerol, metacresol and zinc.</p><p>Glycerol is added as a tonicity modifier, metcresol as preservative and zinc as a stabiliser. The solution is unbuffered (pH 4).</p><p>The LY2963016 Injection finished product formulation is manufactured with no overage of the active substance.</p><p>For the finished product filling operation, the cartridges are overfilled to ensure the delivery of the minimum volume (3 mL) claimed on the cartridge label.</p><p>The LY2963016 Injection formulation development focused on understanding the impact of variation in excipients and formulation composition on key analytical properties of the finished product. The intended commercial formulation of LY2963016 Injection is based on the reference medicinal product. The formulation has been used throughout product development and in all clinical studies.</p><p>All excipients are the same chemical compounds and concentrations as those used in Lantus except 2 minor differences. The LY2963016 Injection formulation uses zinc oxide, instead of zinc chloride as in LANTUS. Zinc oxide is chemically converted to zinc chloride by dissolving it in an excess amount of 10% hydrochloric acid before its addition to the formulation solution. Additionally, LY2963016 Injection formulation uses 100% glycerol which is consistent with Lilly insulin manufacturing practice whereas LANTUS uses 85% glycerol. The final levels of zinc and glycerol in LY2963016 Injection and in LANTUS are the same.</p><p>The applicant has adopted an enhanced approach to formulation development and proposes a formulation design space. The stability of the formulation at the target concentration of each component, but also within the region surrounding the target concentration was studied using statistical design of experiments (DoE). The experimental design was a full factorial design with 3 factors and 2 levels for each factor. Critical quality attributes (CQA) have been identified. Data from the DoE evaluation of the Proven Acceptable Ranges <ref type="bibr">(PAR)</ref> have been provided to show the impact of process parameters on the CQAs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacture of the product and process controls</head><p>The aseptic manufacturing process for Abasria is a standard formulation, filtration and filling operation.</p><p>Cartridges are then assembled into pen injectors or packaged in blisters. The cartridge and disc seal components are well-established components having been used with marketed insulin products for several years. The plunger is made of an elastomer formulation selected for improved compatibility properties with this product.</p><p>The safety of the container closure system components with LY2963016 has been confirmed with compendia compliance and with real time leachables studies. No analytes were measured above the allowable daily intake threshold, indicating a safe toxicological profile.</p><p>The process is well described and a detailed risk assessment was carried out to assign critical, non-critical and operational parameters. The process is well controlled.</p><p>Finished Product will be manufactured at a contract manufacturer, USA and Lilly, France. Process data is provided for the primary batches and commercial batches produced at Lilly, France and the contract manufacturer, USA. The batch data presented are consistent on the whole for each manufacturing site, with data provided from process validation batches from both sites. Validation for components, equipment and aseptic processing is in place. Media fill program has been validated for sterility at both the contract manufacturer and Lilly France. Compatibility with the non-metal and metal equipment was evaluated and the results are satisfactory.</p><p>Injection cartridges manufactured at the 2 sites (contract manufacturer, USA and Lilly, France) were tested for comparability. There was a detailed study which included structural and batch release data comparisons. An assessment of secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure has been made. In conclusion, comparability of the contract manufacturer, USA and Lilly, France batches has been established and stability data has been provided for the process validation batches produced from active substance manufactured using the proposed commercial active substance process.</p><p>Details for the cartridge and pen-injector (KwikPen) have been provided. The pen assembly process validation strategy has been described and successful process validation gives assurance that these meet the required quality standards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Product specification</head><p>The control tests proposed for the finished product are considered appropriate to ensure sufficient quality with respect to identity, purity/impurities, potency and safety (microbial).</p><p>The analytical methods are validated and the majority of methods are used to control both the active substance and finished product, except for the metacresol method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability of the product</head><p>The proposed shelf life of 24 months at 5°C is supported by data. Stability studies are being conducted for 3 primary batches from each site according to ICH Q5C "Stability testing of biotechnological/biological products" guideline. Stability data show that all analytical properties remained within the proposed specifications at the storage condition of 5°C through the available time points. The patient in-use stability study was conducted using finished product stored under long term conditions for 14 or 24 months. Results were in line with the acceptance criteria and showed no degradation or significant impurity increase.</p><p>The finished product is light sensitive, so packaging ensures exposure to light is minimised.</p><p>In general, the results support the shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC.</p><p>In accordance with EU GMP guidelines 2 , any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biosimilar comparability exercise for finished medicinal product</head><p>Abasria (LY2963016) has been developed with the same pharmaceutical form and strength as LANTUS, allowing direct comparison of the finished products. The biosimilar comparability testing included structural characterization, physicochemical characterization, biological potency (biological activity), impurity characterization and stability assessment.</p><p>The applicant initially proposed to first confirm comparability between US-approved and EU approved Lantus, and between LY2963016 injection that is manufactured at Lilly France and contract manufacturer. Once the two populations of each product were shown to be comparable, it was proposed that comparability would be demonstrated between Lantus and LY2963016 Injection. This approach to the biosimilar comparability exercise was not fully in line with the CHMP guidelines for biosimilars. For the quality biosimilarity exercise, the proposed biosimilar product should be demonstrated to be comparable to the EU reference medicinal product, using multiple batches. In addition, the recommended approach of generating the required quality, safety and efficacy data for the biosimilar comparability study with product manufactured using the final manufacturing process and therefore representing the quality profile of the batches to be commercialised was not followed.</p><p>The applicant subsequently provided data for additional batches of EU-approved Lantus and segregated the information derived from EU-approved and US-approved Lantus. Data from LY2963016 batches manufactured by Lilly France and the contract manufacturer has also been presented separately to allow appropriate assessment. Data comparing LY2963016 and EU-approved Lantus side-by-side has been presented and orthogonal methods have been used for the structural analysis of the primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure. The biosimilar comparability exercise has compared the LY2963016 with the EU-approved Lantus, followed by comparison of the EU-approved Lantus with the US-approved Lantus, to demonstrate the validity of the supportive clinical studies carried out with US-approved Lantus. Additional data from the process validation batches has allowed comparison of the final proposed commercial process with the EU-approved Lantus.</p><p>Physico-chemical characterisation has demonstrated biosimilar comparability between LY2963016 and the reference medicinal product, EU-approved Lantus, with the only observed difference being the presence of low levels of citrate in the Lantus samples detected by NMR. Reference has been made to data using in vitro biological assays with process validation batches and this has been reviewed in the non-clinical assessment.</p><p>Biological potency has also been evaluated by testing LY2963016 Injection and Lantus in a comparability study.</p><p>This demonstrated that the average relative potency was comparable for all these batches of LY2963016</p><p>Injection and Lantus. The applicant has also provided biological identity test data from LY2963016 Injection and Lantus with batches tested concurrently, which were demonstrated to be comparable, showing that the original differences observed were due to analytical variability and diverse testing times for the samples.</p><p>Total impurities and HMWP measured by release methods were lower in LY2963016 Injection batches compared with Lantus, which is attributed to the increased age of the reference medicinal product. One impurity, not found in measurable amounts in Lantus but present in LY2963016 Injection clinical trial batches is below the ICH threshold for toxicity. This impurity is controlled and the applicant has discussed potential clinical implications.</p><p>The assay results between LY2963016 Injection and Lantus indicate that Lantus is formulated to a slightly higher concentration, which did not translate into consistent PK differences.</p><p>The Applicant has provided data to support the claim that LY2963016 Injection and Lantus have similar precipitation characteristics under physiological conditions (in phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4). This demonstrates that these two products have comparable in vitro precipitation and the finished products would be expected to behave in a similar manner in vivo.</p><p>The proposed shelf-life for Abasria is 24 months at 2-8°C, including an in-use period of up to 28 days at 30°C.</p><p>For Lantus it is also 24 months at 2-8°C, but including an in-use period of up to 28 days at 25°C. Stability is comparable on the whole for LY2963016 Injection and Lantus batches, in terms of rates of degradation.</p><p>Both products showed significant degradation on exposure to iron, but the pathway of degradation appeared different. Further studies demonstrated that these differences are likely to be due to citrate, which has been detected in Lantus. Differences were not observed with lower levels of iron, particularly at the levels expected to be present in LY2963016 Injection. Therefore, this discrepancy in iron-induced degradation is not expected to have any impact on the Abasria product under normal conditions.</p><p>Overall, comparability between LY2963016 and the reference medicinal product Lantus has been satisfactorily demonstrated from the quality perspective.</p></div>

The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.</p><p>During the procedure, a major objection was raised regarding the control strategy for the manufacturing process, which was not clearly explained. In response, the Applicant provided a clearer explanation of the manufacturing process control, based on laboratory, pilot and commercial scale operations used in the manufacture of Abasria. Initially, comparability between different processes was not considered sufficiently demonstrated due to the lack of information provided regarding the nature of some of the process changes implemented and the limited degree of testing applied. The Applicant provided further clarifications and data to demonstrate comparability.</p><p>This included extensive characterisation of active substance and finished product batches, with tests performed directly on active substance batches and some tests performed on finished product batches manufactured using active substance from different processes and representing both finished product sites (contract manufacturer USA and Lilly France).</p><p>Primary stability data was provided for clinical trial batches, rather than the proposed commercial process. Lack of data from finished product manufactured through a validated process and with the final commercial active substance process gave rise to a major objection on the claimed shelf life of 24 months at +5°C for the finished product. The applicant provided stability data up to 6 months for batches produced via the validated finished product process and from active substance produced via the commercial process. This provided additional assurance regarding the comparability between different processes and consequently the proposed shelf life was found acceptable.</p><p>A major objection raised regarding the suitability of the proposed commercial plunger system was thoroughly addressed by the applicant. It was demonstrated that finished product using the commercial plunger system and stored under the long term storage conditions (2-8°C) is sufficiently stable for the patient in-use period (of 28 days at 30°C) if used within its suggested shelf-life of 24 months.</p><p>For the demonstration on biosimilar comparability with the reference medicinal product, a major objection was raised regarding the limited techniques applied and insufficient number of batches of reference product (EU-approved Lantus) analysed for several tests. Further data was provided, including side-by-side comparisons between Abasria and EU-approved Lantus using orthogonal methods. Data provided assurance of comparability for primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure. Additional data and clarifications were submitted to satisfactorily demonstrate comparability in terms of potency and biological identity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Pharmacology</head><p>The primary aim of the pharmacology package was to demonstrate similarity between the proposed product, Abasria (LY2963016) and the reference medicinal product, Lantus. Studies were first conducted in order to compare the pharmacological activity of a batch of LY2963016 to that of a US-approved batch of Lantus and subsequently, studies were also conducted with EU-approved Lantus (in accordance with CHMP Scientific advice) and with EU and US-formulated LY2963016. The applicant has therefore provided a series of pharmacology studies with EU and US-formulated LY2963016 and EU and US-approved Lantus and has attempted to characterise the binding affinity and functional activity at the relevant insulin receptors. In addition, the potential to stimulate lipogenic activity in adipocytes and mitogenicity in IR and IGF-1 receptor dominant cells has been evaluated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary pharmacodynamic studies</head><p>Overall, the general rank orders of affinity to and potency (autophosphorylation) of Lantus and insulin reference compounds at the IGF-1, IR-A and IR-B receptors were in line with that reported previously <ref type="bibr">[Sommerfeld, 2010]</ref>. Data from the preliminary study suggest that the affinity and potency (autophosphorylation) of a batch of LY2963016 was similar to that of US-approved Lantus at the IGF-1, IR-A and/or IR-B receptors. In the definitive study, the affinity of batches of LY2963016 evaluated (EU and US-pooled) was considered to be similar to the batches of Lantus (EU and US-pooled). The potency of LY2963016 (EU and US-pooled) at the IR-A was slightly (1.2-fold) lower than Lantus (EU and US pooled) and the potency of US-formulated LY2963016 at the IR-A and IR-B receptor was 1.2 to 1.6-fold higher than that of EU-formulated material. The CHMP notes that the observed difference in potency at the IR-A receptor (between EU and US-LY2963016) correlates with a difference in affinity. Although the observed differences were statistically significant, the applicant did not consider these differences to be of biological significance [as the observed difference was less than the mean significant ratio (MSR); see Discussion].</p><p>The applicant suggested that in mouse adipocytes, the lipogenic potency of LY2963016 was similar to that of the reference product, Lantus. In the definitive study, statistical differences were observed when comparing the lipogenic/metabolic potencies (EC 50 ) of pooled LY2963016 and pooled Lantus as well as US-formulated LY2963016 to EU-LY2963016. As the observed differences (1.3-1.4-fold) were below the minimum significant ratio (2.61), the applicant considered that these differences were not biologically significant.</p><p>In human osteosarcoma SAOS-2 cells where the mitogenic response is more dependent upon IGF-1R signalling when compared to that of the IR, the rank order of mitogenic potency was in line with the rank order of affinity at the IGF-1 receptor and the rank order of autophosphorylation at the IGF-1 receptor <ref type="bibr">[Sommerfeld, 2010]</ref>, which would suggest that the assay has been sufficiently characterised. Although the EU-formulated LY2963016 had a slightly higher potency when compared to US formulated LY2963016 (1.3-fold, not significant), overall the data presented from the preliminary and definitive studies would suggest that in the SAOS-2 cell line, the mitogenic potency of the batches of LY2963016 tested is generally similar to that of the reference product,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lantus.</head><p>In rat H4IIe hepatoma cells where the mitogenic response is IR-dependent (under serum-free conditions); overall, the mitogenic potency of LY2963016 (pooled) was considered by the applicant to be similar to that of the reference product, Lantus (pooled). It is noted however, that the mitogenic potential of EU-formulated LY2963016 was higher than that of US-formulated LY2963016 (1.7-fold) and the applicant did not consider the observed difference to be biologically relevant.</p></div>

The analytical methods used for the toxicokinetic analyses of samples from the definitive toxicity studies were validated.</p><p>Repeated administration of LY2963016 or Lantus caused a dose-related increase in exposures to immunoreactive insulin glargine; however, the observed increase was not considered to be dose-proportional.</p><p>There was some evidence of accumulation upon repeated dosing. The applicant has suggested that the exposures to insulin glargine are similar following subcutaneous administration of LY2963016 vs Lantus;</p><p>however, the data as presented during the initial submission were difficult to interpret and further clarification was sought. The applicant subsequently presented the data in a manner which allowed comparison; the exposures to insulin glargine as presented were extremely variable in the LY2963016 and Lantus treated groups and there was no clear difference in exposures between the groups. However, with respect to the determination of exposures to insulin glargine the potential for cross reactivity with rat insulin was noted and clarification was sought as to why C-peptide correction was not applied. The applicant highlighted the technical challenges of measuring C-peptide rat serum levels and referred to clinical PK data which demonstrate that endogenous insulin levels are not a significant confounding factor in the comparison of the pharmacokinetics of Lantus and LY2963016.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeat dose toxicity</head><p>In the rat, repeated administration of LY2963016 or Lantus was associated with mortality and clinical signs indicative of severe hypoglycaemia. The mortality rates observed following subcutaneous administration of LY2963016 were generally comparable to that observed with EU or US-approved Lantus. The maximum observed reductions in glucose were observed between 1 to 4 hours post-dose and the duration of hypoglycaemia was dose-related, persisting for up to 2, 8 and 12 to 18 hours post-dose at 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0/2.0 mg/kg, respectively. The applicant considered the glucodynamic profiles for LY2963016 and Lantus (US or EU-approved) to be similar. An increase in body weight/body weight gain and food consumption was also noted and is considered to be secondary to the observed hyperinsulinaemia and hypoglycaemia.</p><p>Effects on the central and peripheral nervous system have been reported for agents that induce hypoglycaemia, including insulin glargine <ref type="bibr">[Yasaki and Dyck 1990]</ref>. During the repeated-dose studies conducted by the applicant, such effects were limited to the sciatic nerve. The CHMP notes that the incidence of degeneration of axons in the sciatic nerve at 2 mg/kg is higher in animals treated with LY2963016 (females) (when compared to EU-approved Lantus). However, in light of the absence of a similar trend for the study comparing LY2963016 to US-approved Lantus or a clinical correlate, no further action is required.</p><p>Increased deep dermal adipose tissue in skin/subcutis sections and at subcutaneous injection sites were observed at 1 mg/kg (LY2963016 and Lantus) which is indicative of lipohypertrophy (typical of insulins). In addition, decreased pancreatic islet cell cytoplasm and vacuolation was noted at ≥1.0 mg/kg/day; this finding is indicative of islet cell atrophy and is consistent with negative feedback in hyperinsulinaemic animals and a subsequent reduction in insulin production. The incidence of these findings appeared to be similar for LY2963016 vs. Lantus.</p><p>The CHMP also notes that the NOAEL for the 4-week study in the rat was 0.3 mg/kg for LY2963016 or EU/US-approved Lantus. Although the studies conducted by the innovator (as presented by the applicant) did not include a 1-month study, it is acknowledged that the NOAELs for 3 and 6-month studies were of a similar magnitude (0.146 mg/kg and 0.229 mg/kg, respectively).</p></div>

After review of the initial submission, the potential for LY2963016 (and how this compares to EU-approved Lantus) to cause IR-dependent mitogenesis was not entirely clear as all of the relevant pharmacology studies had not been conducted with material that was representative of the proposed commercial product. Subsequently, the applicant conducted a series of studies with commercial process material (reported within DBT 149), which demonstrated that the mitogenic potential of LY2963016 was similar to that of Lantus. However, further clarification was sought as to why IGF-1 was not included as a reference in the assay conducted in human osteosarcoma SAOS-2 cells where the mitogenic response was said to be IGF-1 dependent. Additional studies Assessment report EMA/CHMP/340840/2014 Page 21/65 were performed in order to address this and IGF-1 and other reference standards were included in order to characterise the assay, as per regulatory guidance.</p><p>In conclusion, taking all of the data submitted into consideration, it is agreed that the carcinogenic risk of the proposed product is similar to that of the currently marketed product, Lantus.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.5.">Discussion on non-clinical aspects</head><p>The non-clinical (pharmacology) studies were conducted with material from a process similar to the process used for the commercial product. A major objection was raised, as the batches of LY2963016 tested were not truly representative of the final commercial product and biocomparability between material from the processes had not been adequately demonstrated. The applicant subsequently performed a series of in vitro studies in order to address this issue and the data were submitted in a separate report.</p><p>The pharmacology written summary and the text within the study reports suggest that the potency (in terms of the ability to stimulate autophosphorylation at the IR receptors, lipogenesis and mitogenesis) of the test articles was expressed as the EC 50 relative to a maximum response as observed with an insulin reference standard.</p><p>Although the data as presented did allow comparison of the respective groups, definitive conclusions as to how LY2963016 compares to Lantus could not be made upon review of the initial submission. The applicant subsequently provided some raw and/or untransformed data which allowed an easier comparison of how the data points were distributed within each individual group and how the data were distributed for the negative controls vs. the maximum observed response. The data from the preliminary and definitive binding affinity and potency (autophosphorylation) studies suggested that when compared to human insulin, the affinity and/or potency for Lantus was 1.4 to 1.7-fold higher at the IR-A receptor and only 1.1 to 1.8-fold higher at the IR-B receptor. As the observed differences as presented in the dossier are slightly smaller than those observed by other investigators, this questioned (i) the focus on the pivotal study, DBT 134 where the difference between the affinity and potency of human insulin vs. Lantus at the IR-A and IR-B receptor was less pronounced (1.1-1.6-fold) and therefore raised concerns about the ability of this assay to pick up subtle differences in affinity (i.e. are the differences as observed during the pivotal studies actually larger than they appear?) (ii) the use of the minimum significant ratio, MSR, which ranged from 1.89 to 2.27 (2.61 for the metabolic potency assay) to define whether results were of biological significance. By the applicant's definition the observed difference in affinity and potency between human insulin and Lantus is not biologically relevant as it was less than the MSR; this is in contrast to the overall conclusions in the EPAR summary for Lantus.</p><p>In the responses provided, while the applicant maintained that the data generated during the conduct of studies, DBT 93, DBT 134 and those performed by Sommerfeld and colleagues are similar, it was still evident from the data presented, that the observed differences between Lantus and the positive control insulin were less pronounced during the pivotal study, DBT 134. However, the applicant conducted a more recent study with commercial process material and implemented a number of measures in order to reduce the extent of variability. Moreover, statistical comparisons were made between LY2963016 and EU-approved Lantus. The observed differences in affinity and potency observed during Study DBT 149 (for insulin vs. Lantus) were closer to those published by Sommerfeld and colleagues, despite the differences in the assay systems employed, which was somewhat encouraging. However, it was noted that the magnitude of the differences between the positive controls, insulin and AspB10, (the latter is known to have higher affinity at the IGF-1 and IR receptors) was consistently smaller in the more recent study, DBT 149, when compared to the original study DBT 134. The</p><p>Guideline on non-clinical and clinical development of similar biological medicinal products containing recombinant human insulin and insulin analogues [EMA/134217/2012] specifically states that it is important that assays used for comparability testing are demonstrated to have appropriate sensitivity to detect minute differences. Given that measures were put in place to improve the assay, the applicant was asked to discuss why the DBT 149 study did not demonstrate a larger difference in potency between the reference standards, insulin and AspB10 at the IR receptors (particularly the IR-A receptor, where the smallest difference was apparent). It is also noted that if the applicant's rationale is to be applied, the difference in potency at the IR-A receptor between insulin and AspB10 was not of biological significance, so yet again, the application of the MSR to decipher whether differences are of biological significance is questionable and even after receipt of the Day 120 responses, use of the MSR in this context was still not adequately justified.</p><p>The applicant subsequently clarified that the mean potency ratio for IR-A phosphorylation when comparing the potency of insulin to that of the positive control, AspB10 was lower than that previously reported in the literature and that this was most likely due to spurious results generated during a single run. The overall observed difference in IR-A phosphorylation for LY2963016 vs Lantus was simply due to a higher potency ratio again generated during a single run. Given the inherent variability, the Rapporteurs noted that an increased n number should have been considered at the time the studies were conducted. However, when all of the data generated during the 3 separate studies are reviewed as a whole, to produce a larger n number, it is acknowledged that the IR-A phosphorylation assay has the ability to detect differences and the Rapporteurs agreed that the observed difference between the proposed product and the reference product is not of biological significance. Clarification was also sought with respect to the insulin reference standards used during the binding affinity assays as some discrepancies were noted within study report DBT 134; these were addressed upon submission of the Day 120 responses.</p><p>Close examination of the data generated during the preliminary lipogenic potency assay (DBT 93) revealed a considerable amount of variability and in contrast to conclusions drawn by the applicant, the rank order of metabolic potency for the test articles and the reference compounds (Insulin AspB10&gt;human insulin=IGF-1&gt;Lantus) was not in line with that observed for IR autophosphorylation (Insulin Asp B10&gt;human insulin&gt;Lantus&gt;IGF-1), which questioned the ability of the assay to compare the potency of LY2963016 vs.</p><p>Lantus with respect to their ability of stimulate IR-dependent lipogenesis and the applicant's interpretation of the data generated. The data generated during the more recent study (DBT 149) were less variable and no differences in lipogenic potency were apparent for LY2963016 vs. Lantus. However, it is noted that IGF-1 was not included as a reference.</p><p>In rat H4IIe hepatoma cells where the mitogenic response is IR-dependent (under serum-free conditions), results from the preliminary study showed that the rank order of potency for rat H4IIe hepatocyte proliferation was similar to that observed for IR autophosphorylation activity (insulin Asp-B10 &gt; human insulin &gt; LY2963016</p><p>or Lantus &gt;&gt;&gt; IGF-1). However, the rank order of mitogenic potency as demonstrated during the definitive study was not in line with that observed for IR autophosphorylation, (the potency of insulin was ≥ Insulin</p><p>AspB10 and the effects of IGF-1 were not evaluated). Once again, this suggests limitations of the assay used with respect to the mapping of potency at the IR receptor and a functional response (the mitogenic response was previously described by the applicant to be IR-dependent). In the more recent study <ref type="bibr">(DBT 149)</ref>, the applicant demonstrated that insulin AspB10 was more potent than insulin in both the IR-A phosphorylation and the mitogenic assay in rat hepatoma cells which is reassuring. However, concerns remained as to why the reference IGF-1 was omitted during Study 149 considering that current regulatory guidance recommends its inclusion;</p><p>hence, the applicant was invited to address whether the assays (particularly the SAO2-cell assay where mitogenesis is said to be IGF-1 dependent) were sufficiently characterised. In response to the concerns raised by the CHMP, the applicant conducted a number of additional studies which included the comparison of the binding and activity of insulin, AspB10, IGF-1 and a range of other related compounds. Overall, the order of potency of the standards was similar to that published previously and it was acknowledged that the SAO2 cell assay along with the other in vitro assays used had been adequately characterised in line with regulatory guidance. However, the applicant should submit all of the new data generated as a formal report after marketing authorisation.</p><p>It is evident that throughout the initial dossier, small but significant differences in affinity and potency (autophosphorylation, lipogenesis, mitogenesis) were noted when comparing LY2963016 to Lantus or US-formulated LY2963016 to EU-formulated LY2963016 for example. However, the applicant suggested that these differences were not of biological significance. In adition, the applicant has stated that the affinity and that the US-LY2963016 samples were not evaluated in the same run as the Lantus, EU LY2963016 and the relevant positive control samples.</p><p>As described previously, an additional study (DBT 149) was conducted and the assays were improved to minimise the variability observed previously. In this study, a statistical difference was noted in a single assay only, whereby the potency of EU-LY2963016 to phosphorylate the IR-A receptor was higher than that of EU-approved Lantus. On the basis of the numerical/fold difference in potency (1.16-fold) and on the basis of the fact that no statistical differences were noted in any of the other assays, it is agreed that overall, the pharmacological profile of LY2963016 (US or EU) is similar to that of EU-approved Lantus.</p><p>Hence, the overarching Major Objection was resolved, as the data presented suggest that overall; the in vitro pharmacological profile of LY2963016 is similar to that of EU-approved Lantus. In addition, the concerns with respect to the ability of the IR-A phosphorylation assay and its ability to detect subtle differences along with the omission of IGF-1 as a reference have all been addressed.</p><p>The pharmacokinetic data submitted were quite limited and somewhat variable. Two studies were performed which involved a comparison of LY2963016 to either US-approved Lantus or EU-approved Lantus. The applicant was asked to present all parameters in the same manner to allow easier comparison of the datasets generated for both studies; to allow definitive conclusions with respect to similarity to be made. The standard errors and deviations were fairly large and it was evident that there were no apparent differences in the exposure to insulin glargine when comparing LY2963016 to Lantus. However, it is noted that the serum levels of insulin glargine were determined using a validated radioimmunoassay (RIA) method which did not appear to be highly specific for insulin glargine and cross reactivity with rat insulin was likely. C-peptide was not measured, which suggests that no correction of data has been made to exclude physiological insulin; hence, further clarification was sought, especially in light of the observed variability. The applicant maintained that measuring C-peptide levels was not required during the rat toxicology studies, as the contributions of endogenous insulin to the overall immunoreactive insulin glargine response are considered minimal. In light of the technical challenges of measuring C-peptide rat serum levels, the applicant has referred to clinical data which provides further support that endogenous insulin levels are not a significant confounding factor in the comparison of the pharmacokinetics of Lantus and LY2963016.</p><p>In the rat, following repeated dosing for up to 4 weeks, the applicant considered the glucodynamic profiles for LY2963016 and Lantus (US or EU-approved) to be similar. However, the CHMP noted that there was a trend for the rebound increase in glucose levels at the end of the study (on Day 30) to occur at higher doses of LY2963016</p><p>(2 mg/kg) when compared to EU-approved Lantus (≥1 mg/kg). In addition, close examination of the tabulated Summary for Study 8259267 suggested that at the maximum dose tested (2 mg/kg), the increase in body weight gain with EU-approved Lantus was more pronounced than that observed with LY2963016. Taken together with the in vitro data initially submitted, these data suggested that LY2963016 could be slightly less potent than EU-approved Lantus. However, the applicant has clarified that the magnitude of the increase in serum glucose and the incidence of pancreatic islet cell atrophy following repeated administration of LY2963016 are similar to that observed following treatment with EU-approved Lantus. In addition, the applicant has suggested that when the absolute weights are plotted over time, it is evident that there is good agreement in the growth curves for LY2963016 and EU-approved Lantus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.6.">Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects</head><p>In response to the Day 120 List of Questions, the applicant has repeated the in vitro pharmacology studies with batches of LY2963016 that are considered to be representative of the commercial product. The methods used have been improved, the data appear to be less variable than that observed for the previous studies and the batches of LY2963016 tested appear to have a similar in vitro pharmacological profile to that of EU-approved Lantus. However, there were still some concerns with respect to the ability of the IR-A phosphorylation assay to detect subtle differences, along with the omission of IGF-1 as a reference. The applicant has admitted that the inherent variability contributed to the lack of a substantial difference between reference compounds and it is evident that a larger number of experiments should have been performed in order to overcome this. The applicant has also performed a series of additional in vitro binding and functional studies to include IGF-1 and other related compounds as reference standards in order to characterise the methods further. Taken together, these measures help to demonstrate that the assays used have the inherent ability to detect subtle differences.</p><p>Following the evaluation of the latest submission of data, there were no non-clinical objections to the approval of Abasria; however, the CHMP recommended that the new data provided as responses during the procedure are submitted in a report within 6 months of marketing authorisation.</p></div>

The applicant has carried out two efficacy trials provided within the current MAA. Apart from primary evaluation of the non-inferiority of LY2963016 once-daily (QD) to Lantus (QD), as measured by the change in HbA1c from baseline to 24 weeks, these studies included 7-point self-monitored blood glucose [SMBG] profiles and the data on intra-patient blood-glucose (BG) variability, basal and prandial (separately and as total daily) insulin dose, and weight. These comparability data constitute supportive evidence of clinical biosimilarity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytical methods</head><p>Analytical methods applied during the clinical development are summarised below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Methods for measuring human immunoreactive insulin glargine</head><p>A radioimmunoassay (RIA) was used to measure the "free" immunoreactive insulin (i.e., insulin and insulin analogues not bound to endogenous anti-insulin antibodies) in human serum. It is not selective for insulin glargine as the immunoreactive insulin response is a summative response to insulin glargine, its metabolites M1 and M2, and endogenous insulin. The RIA assay has complete cross-reactivity to insulin glargine and endogenous insulin and is also expected to have complete reactivity to M1 and M2 given their molecular sequences. In a published study supported by Sanofi-Aventis a selective LC/MS/MS method provided the same results for M1 than the immunoreactive insulin measured with an unselective RIA assay since M1 appeared the predominant metabolite and insulin glargine and M2 concentrations were below the lower limit of quantitation <ref type="bibr">(Lucidi, 2012)</ref>. The LLOQ of the RIA assay is 50 pM and its percentage to the C max is approximately 30%, higher than 5% as recommended in the Guideline on the Bioanalytical Method Validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009). However, the assay is sufficiently sensitive to fully characterize the flat profile of the active drug over the 24-hour PK sampling window.</p><p>The endogenous insulin concentration was separately estimated by measuring C-peptide using a commercial sandwich immunoassay approved by the FDA with additional validation by the central laboratory performing the analysis. The total measured insulin concentration was corrected with the endogenous insulin concentration using the method of Owens (1986). This is a well-established method that has been widely used ever since its Assessment report EMA/CHMP/340840/2014 Page 28/65 introduction and was also used for the estimation of endogenous insulin for all studies conducted by Sanofi-Aventis with the reference product in healthy subjects. More recent methods have been proposed but are not devoid of limitations. As there is no gold standard, this method was considered acceptable by the CHMP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Method for measuring anti-insulin antibodies</head><p>The immunogenicity assay was developed as a conventional radioligand binding assay. After adding a radiolabeled tracer (LY2963016) to a serum sample, percent binding represents the percent of the total amount of tracer that co-precipitates with the antibodies. Similar to titres, it is a method of quantifying the amount of antibody in a sample; unlike titres, it is a continuous variable. Antibodies to native human insulin and insulin analogues will also cross-react with LY2963016. Hence, antibodies to LY2963016, insulin glargine, native insulin, and insulin analogues are measured using the same assay. The assay was adequately validated for antibodies against LY2963016 and antibodies cross-reactive to insulin. The sensitivity of the method was considered acceptable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology of PK/PD studies</head><p>The clinical pharmacological development programme was designed to follow the recommendations of the draft revised Guideline on Biosimilar Insulins (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev. 1). It should be demonstrated that the pharmacokinetic profiles are similar after single administration and that the differences between the PD parameters are below a tight limit. Regarding PD measurements, this guideline asserts that the euglycaemic clamp technique is the best available method for the measurement of insulin action. In these clamp experiments, the plasma insulin concentration is raised (e.g. by subcutaneous injection of insulin) and the blood-glucose level maintained ("clamped") at a pre-defined level by means of a variable infusion of glucose. Furthermore, to take into account the high variability of the parameters, replicate designs have been used in the main studies with four periods (2 on each product).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurements</head><p>All studies except for ABEE were conducted in healthy volunteers without prior endogenous insulin suppression.</p><p>The adjustment to background C-peptide levels was done in a consistent way across all studies using Owen's method. Studies in healthy volunteers provided a much more homogenous and sensitive PK comparability model, as prior insulin treatment with lispro was shown to interfere with the performance of immunoreactive detection of insulin glargine concentrations in Study ABEE (patients with T1DM). The determination of PK equivalence was based on comparing C-peptide corrected insulin concentration-time data: AUC from zero to 24 hours (AUC  ), the maximum serum study drug concentration (C max ), and AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC [0-∞) ). The primary use of AUC is accepted as with relatively flat time-concentration profile, the use of C max for demonstrating PK equivalence of long-acting insulin products has lower sensitivity in detecting subtle differences.</p><p>The CHMP had some concerns because the applicant initially planned to carry out studies only in healthy volunteers while endogenous insulin levels can have a significant confounding effect. The CHMP suggested two additional studies to address this concern:</p><p>• a clamp study with two different doses "to increase the sensitivity of the study and help judge the magnitude of the observed differences, as similar dose-response would add strength to the evidence of biosimilarity".</p><p>Study ABEM was therefore carried out with the applicant opting to compare the PK/PD response at two additional dose levels. This study was powered on the basis of estimates precision and not for any formal statistical comparison.</p><p>• a study showing similar duration of action in diabetic patients. Study ABEE was therefore conducted in patients with T1DM but without formal statistical criteria.</p><p>All formal statistical evaluation for PK comparability was carried out using pre-specified statistical plans and conventional objectives to declare PK equivalence only if 90% CI for AUC and other appropriate parameters were completely contained within the interval of 0.8-1.25.</p><p>In addition to PK sampling, glucodynamic evaluations using the euglycaemic clamp method were carried out.</p><p>The subjects underwent preparation for the euglycaemic clamp procedure commencing up to 2 hours prior to dosing and continued the clamp for up to 24 hours post-dose. The glucose infusion rates (GIRs) required for maintaining euglycaemia and blood glucose concentrations as a measure of PD effect were documented throughout the procedure. The methodology for automated or manual glucodynamic parameter recording and statistical analysis applied to all submitted studies was satisfactory from planning and blinding perspectives. The analyses were performed using a locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) function applied to all individual GIR versus time profiles in each treatment group. The fitted data for each subject were used to calculate the primary PD parameters: maximum glucose infusion rate (R max ) and total amount of glucose infused (G tot ) over the duration of the clamp procedure. For long-acting insulins, clamp duration of at least 24 hours is expected but it is agreed that the primary endpoint should be the GIR-AUC over the dosing interval, i.e. 24 hours in this case. Therefore, the duration of the clamp studies in healthy volunteers was considered acceptable by the CHMP.</p><p>The primary PD parameters (R max and G tot ) were log-transformed prior to analysis. For each PD parameter, the difference in least-square means along with the 90% CI was back transformed to produce the ratio of geometric means and the CI comparing LY2963016 to Lantus. PD comparability was concluded if the 90% CI was completely contained within the interval of 0.80 to 1.25. This margin was first chosen for feasibility reasons as the choice of a tighter equivalence margin would have resulted in too large sample size, which would not be feasible in a single centre; indeed, clamp methodology is specific to clinical sites. Furthermore, due to the considerable variation in insulin needs and individual dose adjustment, a tighter equivalence margin is not required from a clinical perspective. CHMP guidance requires 95% CIs for PD parameters and statistical analyses that exclude the subjects who do not provide evaluable data for both the test and reference products. This analysis was initially presented only for the pivotal PK/PD trial, but subsequently for supportive studies as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results of PK/PD data</head><p>The results are presented in Tables 5 &amp; 6  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study ABEM</head><p>Abbreviations: AUC(0-24) = area under the serum concentration versus time curve from zero to 24 hours; AUC(0-inf) = area under the serum concentration versus time curve from time zero to infinity; Cmax = maximum serum concentration; Gtot = total amount of glucose infused during the clamp procedure; LS = least-squares; Rmax = maximum glucose infusion rate during the clamp procedure. a Ratio is Test/Reference where Test = LY2963016 and Reference = EU-approved Lantus b subjects who completed all periods of the study and had evaluable data in those periods</p><p>Study ABEI was the first study, which demonstrated a similar relative bioavailability and a comparable PD profile for LY2963016 and Lantus at the dose of 0.5 U/kg. The relative bioavailability analysis, based on statistical comparisons of AUCs and C max established that both PK parameters using correction for baseline C-peptide levels were similar but the values derived for LY2963016 were slightly lower than those with Lantus.</p><p>The 90%CI AUC 0-∞ ratio was slightly outside the targeted 0.8-1.25 limits (0.77-1.07) but this is not surprising given the small sample size of this pilot study and the variability of the half-life determination for a long-acting analogue. Likewise, the statistical comparisons of G tot and R max showed 95%CI outside the pre-defined 0.80-1.25 limits with the ratios of least-square geometric means of 0.95 (0.69-1.32) and 0.94 (90% CI: 0.68-1.30), respectively.</p><p>Study ABEN was conducted in order to fulfil the purpose of achieving biosimilarity claims for LY2963016 in both the EU and US regions and comparing the EU and US reference Lantus materials. The study showed unequivocally that AUCs and C max were similar between EU and US-approved Lantus products, with ratios of LS geometric means between 0.96 to 0.99 for all PK parameters (in all subjects and in completers defined as those who completed all treatment periods) and 90%CIs for these parameters fully contained within the pre-specified interval 0.80 to 1.25. Furthermore, EU-and US-approved Lantus reference products were shown to be PD equivalent in terms of total amount of glucose infused and maximum glucose infusion rate during the 24 hour clamp procedure. Hence, the EU and US Lantus reference products were shown to be comparable from the PK and PD perspective, thus supporting the use of both products in the efficacy/safety studies.</p><p>Study ABEA was the pivotal trial conducted to demonstrate PK equivalence between 0.5 U/kg SC doses of LY2963016 and Lantus. Based on statistical comparisons of AUCs and C max , the PK profiles were shown to be Assessment report EMA/CHMP/340840/2014 Page 32/65 similar with ratios of LS geometric means of 0.91 and 0.95 for the primary parameters AUC (0-24) and C max , and 90% CIs completely contained within the pre-specified interval 0.80 to 1.25.</p><p>Importantly, PK similarity between LY2963016 and Lantus was apparent when either the concentration-time data for immunoreactive insulin or C-peptide corrected insulin using Owens method were used for the analysis.</p><p>Additionally, the C-peptide concentration-time profiles were superimposable between LY2963016 and Lantus with comparable standard deviations ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5)</ref>, showing a similar level of suppression of endogenous insulin following LY2963016 or Lantus administration and reducing potential errors introduced by any C-peptide correction method. and Lantus with ratios of LS geometric means (0.95 and 0.99, respectively) and 95% CIs (ranging between 0.90 and 1.05) well contained within 0.80-1.25. Partial GIR-AUCs are meaningful additional PD parameters, which were presented following CHMP request; these further confirmed the PD equivalence of both products (data not shown).</p><p>In study ABEM, the PK parameters essentially overlapped between LY2963016 and Lantus. Similar PK profiles were observed at both 0.3 U/kg and 0.6 U/kg doses. The ratios of geometric LS means for the primary PK parameters, AUC (0-24) and C max , were 1.03 for both parameters following a 0.3 U/kg dose, and 1.07 and 1.03, respectively, following a 0.6 U/kg dose. All the corresponding 90% CIs limits, which ranged between 0.91 and 1.21, were contained within the interval of 0.80-1.25 when all subjects were considered; however, in the analysis of completers, the upper limit of the equivalence interval for the AUC ratio was marginally above it (1.27), a result which is compatible with a large confidence interval around a point estimate of 1.07 due to small sample size.</p><p>The ratios of the geometric means for the primary PD parameters (G tot and R max ) following administration of LY2963016 versus Lantus were 1.01 and 1.05, respectively, after a 0.3 U/kg dose, and 0.84 and 0.92, respectively, after a 0.6 U/kg dose. The 95% CIs limits ranged between 0.76 and 1.34 for the low dose and 0.61 to 1.17 for the high dose. While it is acknowledged that the study was not powered to show PK and PD equivalence, the results at the low dose (0.3 U/kg) with point estimates close to 1.0 appeared compatible with similarity of the test and reference products. In contrast, the results at the high dose (0.6 U/kg) in the same subjects suggested a lower effect of LY2963016 compared to Lantus; the comparison of partial GIR-AUCs showed that the difference was essentially apparent during the early absorption phase (first 6 hours) with a ratio of 0.66 (95%CI 0.44, 1.08) as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 7</ref>.</p><p>After further investigation following CHMP request, the applicant showed that this difference was mainly driven by a single subject with an aberrant GIR profile, for which no plausible physiological explanation could be found (clamp data at the 0.3 U/kg dose within expected range and PK profile reflecting insulin absorption). A post-hoc analysis excluding this single outlier provided ratios of the GIR-AUC geometric means close to 1, except in the first 6 hours, but a ratio of 0.77 in the beginning of the clamp experiment was considered by the CHMP to be within acceptable limits given the small size of the trial <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">(Table 7)</ref>.  Study ABEE was carried out in stable T1DM patients who were receiving baseline insulin treatment. The study yielded limited PK data and its interpretation was hampered by cross-reactivity with the carried over background insulin (especially in the initial portion of the time-concentration curve). The profiles of the concentration curves appeared to be similar but no formal PK equivalence was declared as the study was primarily PD in nature and its primary objective was to compare the duration of action of LY2963016 and Lantus. Individual patient PK profiles appeared similar but not fully overlapping and accompanied with a high degree of variability. PD comparability was carried out via the assessment of several parameters describing the duration of action. A substantial number (35%) of clamps were terminated at 42 hours, before the end of action was reached.</p><p>Nevertheless, the median duration of action was estimated to be 37.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Absorption</head><p>Abasria is only administered subcutaneously. Its prolonged duration of action is dependent on its injection into subcutaneous tissue, which results in a slow and prolonged absorption, similar to the reference product Lantus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distribution</head><p>As a result of slow absorption, the distribution phase of insulin glargine is long-lasting. No estimate of the volume of distribution is available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Elimination</head><p>After subcutaneous injection of Abasria, insulin glargine is rapidly metabolized at the carboxyl terminus of the beta chain with formation of two active metabolites M1 (21A-Gly-insulin) and M2</p><p>(21A-Gly-des-30B-Thr-insulin). In plasma, the principal circulating compound is the metabolite M1. The median half-life of immunoreactive insulin associated with the terminal rate constant in non-compartmental analysis was estimated to be approximately 10 hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dose proportionality and time dependencies</head><p>Pharmacokinetics appeared approximately dose-proportional over the dose range tested (0.3 to 0.6 U/kg).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanism of action</head><p>Insulin glargine is a human insulin analogue designed to have a low solubility at neutral pH. It is completely soluble at the acidic pH of the Abasria injection solution. After injection into the subcutaneous tissue, the acidic solution is neutralised leading to formation of micro-precipitates from which small amounts of insulin glargine are continuously released, providing a smooth, peakless, predictable concentration/time profile with a prolonged duration of action.</p><p>In vitro studies indicate that the affinity of insulin glargine and its metabolites M1 and M2 for the human insulin receptor is similar to the one of human insulin.</p><p>The primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogues lower blood glucose levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis in the adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary and Secondary pharmacology</head><p>The similarity of the pharmacodynamic actions was investigated using the euglycaemic clamp technique. In this assessment report the PD results were summarized and assessed together with PK data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.4.">Discussion on clinical pharmacology</head><p>The assay format (RIA) employed by the applicant for the measurement of insulin glargine concentration is considered acceptable; it has recently been published by the manufacturer of Lantus that the response to M1</p><p>(the predominant metabolite) in a selective LC/MS/MS assay measuring separately insulin glargine, M1, and M2 was similar to that of the combined immunoreactive insulin response of the RIA assay. Furthermore, the assay is considered sufficiently sensitive to measure insulin concentrations over 24 hours given the flat PK profile of insulin glargine.</p><p>The design of five completed PK/PD studies ABEI, ABEN, ABEM, ABEA and ABEE appears to be satisfactory and overall complies with CHMP biosimilar insulin guideline and recommendations given in the CHMP Scientific Advice. Although an evaluation over 24 hours does not cover the full PK/PD profile of long-acting insulins, and thus, clamp duration of at least 24 hours is expected, the primary endpoints should be the insulin AUC and GIR-AUC over the dosing interval, i.e. 24 hours in this case. Therefore, the duration of the clamp studies in healthy volunteers is considered acceptable; moreover, the supportive study in patients with T1DM was extended well beyond (up to 42 hours).</p><p>PK and PD comparability is the cornerstone on which the biosimilarity is established for new biosimilar insulin products and glucodynamic studies using euglycaemic clamp evaluations represent a key tool in achieving this objective. PK equivalence of LY2963016 and Lantus has been convincingly demonstrated across all studies and all doses using methodology in line with CHMP guidance, including analyses with outliers.</p><p>As for the PD assessment, the pivotal trial demonstrated that LY2963016 has similar effects to Lantus at 0.5 U/kg based on primary and secondary parameters. Importantly, the actual 95%CIs for the primary parameters (G tot and R max ) ratios were contained within a much tighter interval (1.0 ± 0.1) than predefined. The comparison of the duration of action in patients with T1DM showed high variability but provided supportive evidence of similarity. The results from the supportive study requested by the CHMP to investigate two further doses (0.3 U/kg and 0.6 U/kg) appeared also compatible with a similar PD response, acknowledging that this trial was not powered to formally demonstrate PD equivalence.</p><p>In additional analyses provided by the applicant following CHMP request, both PK and PD appeared approximately dose-proportional. From these analyses combined with data from the literature, it is likely that the 0.5 U/kg dose level is in the linear portion of the dose-response curve. Based on the comparison of the slopes of the dose-response relationship for PK or PD parameters, G tot seemed to be the most sensitive parameter to detect differences between the two products.</p></div>

Study ABEB is a 52 week study (24-week treatment period and 28-week extension period) in patients with T1DM and study ABEC is a 24-week study in T2DM. In each respective study, the primary outcome was assessed at the end of the 24-week treatment period. Both studies used treat-to-target approaches to achieve the protocol-specified glycaemic goals (for example, HbA1c</p><p>&lt;7.0%, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≤6.0 mmol/L, other pre-prandial capillary BG 3.9 to 7.2 mmol/L without incurring hypoglycaemia in Study ABEB; FPG &lt;5.6 mmol/L, HbA1c &lt;7.0% without incurring hypoglycaemia in Study ABEC).</p><p>The details of both studies are summarized below.    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatments ABEB</head><p>Clinical lots produced in cartridges of LY2963016 were employed in study ABEB. Insulin glargine once-daily was started at the same dose and administered at same timing (i.e., daytime or night-time) as the patient's pre-study once daily basal insulin. Insulin lispro was administered with meals at the same dose as the patient's pre-study insulin dose while avoiding hypoglycaemia. The basal and bolus insulin doses were adjusted during the study to achieve glycaemic targets (HbA1c &lt;7%, FPG ≤108 mg/dL [6.0 mmol/L], other preprandial capillary blood glucose 70 to 130 mg/dL), without incurring hypoglycaemia. The mode of administration was subcutaneous. The treatment duration was 52 weeks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ABEC</head><p>Clinical lots produced in vials of LY2963016 were employed in study ABEC. Patients previously on Lantus started LY2963016 QD at an equivalent dose as pre-study Lantus. Insulin naïve patients had a starting dose of 10 U LY2963016 QD. All patients then followed a patient-driven dosing algorithm while being supervised by investigators through the course of the study to maintain the fasting blood glucose (FBG) ≤100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) while avoiding hypoglycaemia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives ABEB</head><p>The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that LY2963016 once-daily was non-inferior to LANTUS (once-daily), as measured by change in HbA1c from baseline to 24 weeks, when used in combination with pre-meal insulin lispro administered thrice daily (TID). The main secondary objectives of the study were:</p><p>− To compare safety of LY2963016 relative to LANTUS (e.g., incidence of anti-insulin antibodies, hypoglycemia, adverse events [AEs]) when used in combination with pre-meal insulin lispro.</p><p>− To compare LY2963016 relative to LANTUS for other efficacy variables (e.g., change in HbA1c at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 36 weeks, and 52 weeks; 7-point self-monitored blood glucose [SMBG] profiles;</p><p>percentage of patients with HbA1c &lt;7%, percentage of patients with HbA1c ≤6.5%).</p><p>− To compare LY2963016 relative to LANTUS with regard to intra-patient blood-glucose (BG) variability, basal and prandial (separately and as total daily) insulin dose, and weight when used in combination with pre-meal insulin lispro.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis population and time point description</head><p>Per-Protocol (PP) at 24-week EP (LOCF). The PP population included all FAS/ITT patients who had no violations of inclusion/exclusion criteria, had not discontinued from the study prior to 24 weeks, had not been off study medication for more than 10 consecutive days during the treatment period, and had not received chronic (lasting longer than 14 days) systemic glucocorticoid therapy (excluding topical, intra-articular, intraocular, and inhaled preparations An updated analysis at 52 weeks was subsequently submitted for study ABEB. The LS mean change in HbA1c from baseline to the 52-week endpoint (LOCF) was -0.256% in the LY2963016 arm and -0.276% in the Lantus arm, respectively (FAS analysis); the LS mean treatment difference was 0.020% (95% CI: -0.099%, 0.140%), therefore non-inferiority was maintained after 1 year of treatment. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.2.">Discussion on clinical efficacy Design and conduct of clinical studies</head><p>For the purpose of the clinical biosimilarity exercise for biosimilar insulin products, the CHMP is of the view that the evaluation of HBA1c is not a sensitive endpoint and therefore efficacy studies evaluating HBA1c are not generally anticipated (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005). However, the applicant has conducted two phase III non-inferiority studies comparing the test and reference product in order to investigate how PK/PD features of the biosimilar product translate into clinical parameters relevant for the management of patients with Type 1 and 2 DM. Furthermore, both efficacy studies provide the safety and immunogenicity datasets that are still required by the CHMP guideline.</p><p>In general, according to EU biosimilar guidelines, equivalence trials are expected but subject to appropriate clinical and scientific justifications, a non-inferiority approach can be accepted. The applicant has adequately Assessment report EMA/CHMP/340840/2014 Page 51/65 justified the non-inferiority margin of 0.3% for HbA1c, both from a statistical and clinical standpoint. Given the supportive role of these phase III studies in the biosimilar programme, the statistical methodology for these studies does not raise major concerns.</p><p>The choice of the patient population, i.e. well-controlled Type 1 DM managed on Lantus, NPH insulin or insulin detemir for at least 1 year (study ABEB) and well-controlled patients with Type 2 DM managed on oral antiglycaemic agents and who were either insulin-naïve or previously treated with Lantus patients (study ABEC), sufficiently covers and represents the paradigm of current management of diabetes with long-acting insulins.</p><p>Given the primary endpoint at 24 weeks and that collection of self-monitored blood glucose levels and insulin dosages were carried out, these studies provide additional supportive value to the PK/PD comparability programme conducted in healthy volunteers and T1DM patients.</p><p>Both trials were conducted in numerous European and US sites but also included sites in Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and Taiwan. Provided results are shown to be similar across geographical regions, this is acceptable in the context of a biosimilar application. Overall, the conduct of both studies was acceptable and there were no notable findings that could have impacted on the robustness of clinical findings and conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy data and additional analyses</head><p>Patient demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across treatment arms, except for a statistically significant imbalance in the proportion of patients with HbA1c &gt;7% in the LY2963016 arm compared to the Lantus arm in study ABEB. In order to account for this baseline imbalance, the applicant has carried out post-hoc analysis of the primary endpoint with similar non-inferiority conclusion as in the pre-specified analysis.</p><p>Based on the data provided, non-inferiority of LY2963016 to Lantus was demonstrated in both studies using both FAS and PP datasets. Actual results showed an upper limit of the 95% CI being less than 0.25% in both clinical trials, which is substantially less than 0.3%.</p><p>Overall, the results of other secondary endpoints were consistent with the results of the primary endpoint. Some differences were identified in both studies but they were not considered clinically relevant when the results of the two studies were taken together.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study ABEB</head><p>Patients in the LY2963016 arm had statistically significantly lower mean BG values at bedtime and 3 am compared with the Lantus arm; however, the mean difference between treatment arms was small and unlikely to result in clinically meaningful differences, as reflected by no difference in nocturnal hypoglycaemia. There were no statistically significant differences between treatment arms in mean FBG (morning pre-meal) values, daily mean pre-meal or post-prandial BG values, and the daily mean BG values. Additionally, this finding was not replicated in study ABEC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study ABEC</head><p>• The LS mean BG value was lower in the LY2963016 arm at the morning 2-hour post-prandial time point and statistically significantly lower at the midday pre-meal time point compared with the Lantus arm although there were no statistically significant differences between treatment arms in the morning pre-meal BG values, the daily mean BG values, the daily mean pre-meal and post-prandial BG values, or in the bedtime to 3 am excursion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The increases in LS mean body weight from baseline were statistically significantly smaller in the LY2963016 arm compared with the Lantus arm at Week 2, Week 4 and Week 20. There were no statistically significant Assessment report EMA/CHMP/340840/2014 Page 52/65 differences in body weight changes at any other visit or endpoint (LOCF). Baseline differences in body weight and insulin doses may have confounded early weight gain at Week 2 and 4. Furthermore, the differences were small (&lt; 0.5 kg) and this finding was not replicated in patients with T1DM.</p><p>• At 24 weeks, the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c &lt;6.5% was 26.8% in LY2963016 and 30.4% in Lantus groups respectively, whilst at the baseline the proportions were 3.5% and 2.4%, respectively.</p><p>Similarly at baseline in study ABEC, the proportion of patients with &lt;7.0% HBA1c was 6.2% in LY2963016 and 7.2% in Lantus arms but at 24 weeks there was a modest trend for reduction of the proportion in LY2963016 group (48.8% vs. 52.5%). A supplemental subgroup analysis of HbA1c evolution according to baseline HbA1c levels (&lt; 7% and ≥ 7%), considered more sensitive than the responder analysis, was provided. In the largest subgroup of subjects with baseline HbA1c level ≥7%, the difference in HbA1c decrease was very small (mean 0.02%; 95%CI -0.13%, +0.18%) and clearly below differences that can be considered clinically meaningful.</p><p>Finally, to further support the similarity of the PD effects at high doses, an additional analysis of the self-monitored blood glucose profiles was performed in both clinical studies; it showed comparable glucose levels with LY2963016 and Lantus in the subgroup of patients receiving doses of insulin glargine ≥ 0.6 U/kg/d, in particular during the first hours following the injection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.3.">Conclusions on the clinical efficacy</head><p>Two clinical studies conducted in patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes demonstrated that LY2963016 is non-inferior to Lantus in achieving HBA1c at week 24 and therefore provided strong supportive evidence about the comparability of the two products. Importantly, both studies provided data on patients switching from Lantus to LY2963016 at the same dose regimen; no difference in dose changes after titration to tighten glucose blood control was reported between the two treatment arms. The study in type 1 diabetes was pursued up to 52 weeks and non-inferiority of LY2963016 to Lantus was confirmed at this further time point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">Clinical safety</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient exposure</head><p>Overall, 446 patients with T1DM and T2DM were exposed for at least 6 months within the integrated dataset composed of ABEB and ABEC studies. The total amount of comparative data up to 6 months is adequate. In addition, 499/643 patients were of Caucasian origin and there was a substantial subset of patients ≥65 years of age with only few patients exposed in the age group of &gt;75 years.   The 52-week safety data of study ABEB were subsequently submitted. The mean exposure to study drug was 49.3 weeks for the LY2963016 arm and 49.9 weeks for the Lantus arm. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse events</head><p>There were no imbalances in the presentation of adverse events, treatment-related adverse events, study discontinuations, hypoglycaemic episodes and injection site reactions between LY2963016 and Lantus arms in the phase I studies (ABEA, ABEM, ABEE and ABEI). The preliminary safety profile of LY2963016 established during the phase I studies appeared very similar that of Lantus and was considered acceptable.</p><p>Subsequently, the safety profile of LY2963016 was comprehensively evaluated during the 6-month comparative phase of studies ABEB and ABEC. Abbreviations: N = total number of patients; n = number of patients in specified category; T1DM = type 1 diabetes mellitus; T2DM = type 2 diabetes mellitus; TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event. a Patients may be counted in more than 1 category.</p><p>b Deaths are also included as serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events. c As assessed by the investigator.</p><p>The incidence and the pattern of identified AEs and TEAEs with LY2963016 appeared to be very similar to those with Lantus. The incidence of hypoglycaemic, allergic and post-injection site reactions was well balanced between treatment arms in each study.</p><p>The analysis of hypoglycaemic events was very comprehensive and followed the framework of both US and EU diabetes guidelines. The analysis included asymptomatic, relative, and nocturnal hypoglycaemic events. The total number of hypoglycaemic events was numerically lower with LY2963016 compared to Lantus in both studies, including the number of severe hypoglycaemic events. The total number of nocturnal hypoglycaemic events was also numerically lower with LY2963016 compared to Lantus in both studies: ABEB: 2301 events with LY2963016 in 222 patients vs. 2347 events in 216 patients on Lantus; ABEC: 1248 events with LY2963016 in 212 patients vs. 1386 events in 203 patients on Lantus. Of note, the total incidence of hypoglycaemic attacks was found to be greater in study ABEB where all patients were insulin-dependent and this is expected as opposed to a lower incidence of these events in T2DM patients of study ABEC where a significant proportion of patients were insulin-naïve at entry into the study.</p><p>In the 52-week report of study ABEB, an estimated difference of ~3 events/year of hypoglycaemia with BG ≤70 mg/dL was not considered clinically meaningful. Of note, the baseline hypoglycaemia rates were also lower in the LY2963016 arm (8.4/month) than in the Lantus arm (9.3/month). With a more stringent definition (&lt;54 mg/dL), no difference between the two treatment arms was observed. Likewise, in the double-blind study ABEC, Assessment report EMA/CHMP/340840/2014</p><p>Page 55/65 the estimated difference at 24 weeks was even smaller (~1 event/year of hypoglycaemia with BG ≤70 mg/dL) with no difference in documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia.</p><p>The pattern of allergic events was evaluated in a blinded fashion and was based on a thorough skin evaluation questionnaire. The number of allergic events and injection site-related abnormalities appeared similar between the two insulins and considered acceptable. In the 52-week follow-up of study ABEB, 20 patients (7.5%) in the LY2963016 arm and 11 patients (4.1%) in the Lantus arm reported treatment-emergent allergic events.</p><p>The applicant tabulated all cases of neoplasia reported during the development programme and there were no imbalances that would raise any new concerns. The theoretical risk of tumorogenicity with Lantus has been evaluated in numerous post-marketing studies and extensively discussed at CHMP and PRAC in the past. It was agreed that no new studies are required but that the risk has to be monitored and included in the RMP. The applicant has implemented the risk of neoplasia into the RMP and based on the lack of any unanticipated signals in studies ABEC and ABEB, it is considered that passive post-marketing surveillance for neoplastic events with biosimilar LY2963016 will be sufficient.</p><p>The only imbalance identified in the main studies was a higher number of events in the vascular SOC with LY2963016 and this observation was confined entirely to study ABEC: 21 patients (5.6%) vs. 9 patients (2.4%).</p><p>This imbalance was driven by a baseline imbalance in the number of patients with pre-existing hypertension randomised into the LY2963016 arm of study ABEC. The applicant has conducted a number of safety analyses including evaluations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and thorough examination of pre-existing medical histories of affected patients. It is evident that, in the absence of mechanistic association between insulin signalling pathways and vascular tone, the lack of documented risk with the reference product and therefore an absence of plausible biological and clinical causal link, there is a high probability of confounding of the safety profile of insulin products with numerous co-morbidities well-recognised in diabetes mellitus. Finally, the slightly lower frequency of vascular AEs in study ABEB over 52 weeks of follow-up (27.6% with LY2963016 vs. 29.6%</p><p>with Lantus) also suggests that the finding in study ABEC is a chance finding possibly driven by the baseline imbalance of patients with pre-existing hypertension.</p><p>In summary, the safety profile of LY2963016 appeared to be similar to that of Lantus and in line with the safety characteristics expected from an insulin product.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events</head><p>There were no imbalances in the number of SAEs and deaths reported. The number of SAEs with LY2963016 was numerically lower than with Lantus. The occurrence of hypoglycaemia, the most frequent SAE, was similar with both treatments.</p><p>There were a total of 3 deaths in the Phase III studies. In study ABEB, one death was reported at Week 30 in a patient on Lantus. Two deaths were reported in study ABEC: 1 case on Lantus and 1 case on LY2963016. The narratives do not raise any treatment-related concerns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Laboratory findings</head><p>Laboratory measurements were collected at baseline and Week 24 in both studies. None of the differences were found to be clinically relevant or raised new concerns. There were no AEs related to changes in vital signs and ECG findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunological events</head><p>In studies ABEB and ABEC, patient samples were analysed for anti-insulin antibodies, including those cross-reacting with human insulin. In study ABEB, the proportion of patients with detectable anti-insulin antibodies at any time over the 24-week period was 29.8% in the LY2963016 arm vs. 33.7% in the Lantus arm;</p><p>in study ABEC, 15.3% in the LY2963016 arm vs. 11.0% in the Lantus arm (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_30">Table 14</ref>). The applicant presented further analyses of treatment-emergent immune responses using arbitrarily pre-defined definitions, which suggested potential differences between LY2963016 and Lantus.</p><p>The CHMP considered that, for the purpose of comparing the immunogenicity of the test and reference products, the evaluation of the incidence and quantitative measurement of antibodies over time using the continuous variable of percent binding (% B/T) is more informative and accurate than an assessment of the immune response based on arbitrarily selected criteria. Therefore, additional antibody analyses were requested to further compare the immunogenicity profile of the two products up to 52 weeks in study ABEB, to present data separately in patients already treated with Lantus prior to trial entry vs. other basal insulin (study ABEB) or insulin-naïve patients (study ABEC), and to present a quantitative evaluation of total and cross-reactive antibody levels over time (% B/T).</p><p>The proportion of patients with detectable antibodies was comparable throughout both studies, with the exception of a significant overall difference in the subgroup of patients with T2DM that were previously treated with Lantus (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 15</ref>).</p><p>The median antibody levels remained low throughout both studies, with no significant differences between treatment arms regardless of previous insulin treatment. <ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref> presents these data for the subgroup of patients treated with Lantus prior to study entry in both trials. The data for cross-reactive antibodies appeared similar to that of total antibodies. The majority (approximately 70% to 100%) of detectable antibodies in both treatment arms were cross-reactive throughout the studies (data not shown). </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study ABEC</head><p>Finally, there was no evidence that these antibodies had any impact on efficacy and safety outcomes (HbA1c, weight, insulin dose, hypoglycaemic episodes, allergic or injection site reactions) and no consistent differences between the two products were observed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions</head><p>There is no expectation that a development programme for a biosimilar candidate would evaluate various drug-drug interactions previously reported with the reference medicinal product.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discontinuation due to adverse events</head><p>The discontinuations due to treatment-related AEs were numerically higher with Lantus compared to LY2963016. There was no unusual pattern that warrants further action.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.1.">Discussion on clinical safety</head><p>Extensive comparative safety data have been provided, up to 6 months in one study and 12 months in the other study. There was a substantial subset of patients ≥65 years of age, especially with T2DM, with only few patients exposed in the age group of &gt;75 years. This is acceptable as there is no expectation that all different age groups or special populations should be included into the biosimilar development programme. The objective of the biosimilar development is to demonstrate the similarity in safety profile but not to reassess the safety profile of the reference medicinal product.</p><p>The incidence and pattern of identified AEs and TEAEs to LY2963016 appeared to be very similar to those with Lantus; the incidence of hypoglycaemic, allergic and post-injection site reactions was well balanced between treatment arms in each study.</p><p>Although the total number of hypoglycaemic events was numerically lower with LY2963016 compared to Lantus in both studies, the estimated difference in the 52-week update of study ABEB was approximately 3 events per</p><p>year, which is not considered clinically meaningful. Likewise, in the double-blind study ABEC, the estimated difference at 24 weeks was smaller (~1 event/year) with no difference in documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia.</p><p>The number of allergic reactions and injection site-related abnormalities appeared broadly similar between the two insulins and considered acceptable. There were no severe or life-threatening allergic reactions reported.</p><p>There were several cases of malignancies, which were balanced between treatment arms. There were no imbalances in the number of SAEs and deaths.</p><p>The most sensitive population with regard to immunogenicity is the population of patients with type 1 diabetes.</p><p>Study ABEB showed that LY2963016 and Lantus had comparable immunogenicity profiles up to 52 weeks, in terms of incidence and level of anti-insulin antibodies (both total and cross-reactive with human insulin).</p><p>Patients with type 2 diabetes tend to develop anti-insulin antibodies infrequently, and therefore, the numbers involved in study ABEC were much smaller. While no difference in immune response was shown in insulin-naïve patients, a difference in antibody incidence was detected in the subgroup of patients that were on Lantus prior to study entry. However, this is likely a chance finding as there was already a difference at baseline, no difference in antibody levels was detected, and this observation was not corroborated by the data from study ABEB in a larger and more sensitive population.</p><p>For insulin analogues in general, an impact of anti-insulin antibodies on efficacy or safety has only been occasionally reported. In the two clinical studies, antibodies did not appear to have any influence on efficacy and Assessment report EMA/CHMP/340840/2014 Page 60/65 safety outcomes (HbA1c, weight, insulin dose, hypoglycaemic episodes, allergic or injection site reactions) and no consistent differences between the two products were observed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Beneficial effects</head><p>From a quality perspective:</p><p>• Physico-chemical characterisation has demonstrated biosimilar comparability between LY2963016 and the reference medicinal product (EU-approved Lantus) for the primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure.</p><p>• LY2963016 and Lantus were comparable in the average relative potency assay when batches of LY2963016 from Lilly (France) and a contract manufacturer (USA) were compared directly with EU-approved Lantus or US-approved Lantus. Biological identity test data from LY2963016 finished product and Lantus were also demonstrated to be comparable in batches tested concurrently.</p><p>• LY2963016 has the same quantitative formulation as Lantus, with comparable levels of metacresol and zinc, also similar pH.</p><p>• Levels of total impurities and HMWP were comparable in LY2963016 and Lantus.</p><p>• Comparable chromatographic profiles were demonstrated for LY2963016 and Lantus, except for low levels of an impurity in LY2963016. This product-related impurity was shown to be active in the reporter gene assay and was qualified in toxicology studies. This impurity is controlled in the purification process.</p><p>• LY2963016 finished product and Lantus have similar in vitro precipitation characteristics under physiological conditions.</p><p>From a non-clinical perspective:</p><p>• The data from the binding affinity, functional, metabolic potency and rat hepatoma mitogenesis assays showed that LY2963016 is similar to EU-approved Lantus.</p><p>From a clinical perspective:</p><p>• In single dose cross-over studies ABEA and ABEM conducted in healthy volunteers the PK parameters for LY2963016 and Lantus adjusted for baseline C-peptide levels established biosimilarity based on 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of both primary parameters (C max and AUC 0-24 ), which were well contained within the standard bioequivalence interval of 0.80 -1.25.</p></div>

In both studies, significant (p&lt;0.001) reductions in HbA1c at 24 weeks were achieved with the two products. Likewise, non-inferiority of LY2963016 to Lantus was confirmed at the final time point (52 weeks) of study ABEB in T1DM patients.</p><p>Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects.</p><p>From a quality perspective:</p><p>• Low levels of citrate were detected in the Lantus samples (both EU and US Lantus) by NMR, which is not present in LY2963016.</p><p>• Differences were observed in the degradation pathways under accelerated conditions, although no differences were observed under long term storage conditions.</p><p>From a non-clinical perspective:</p><p>• Differences were initially observed in the functional activity for stimulating auto-phosphorylation of the human insulin receptor IR-A, but pooling of datasets from several studies has indicated that the differences observed with this sensitive assay were not of biological significance.</p><p>From a clinical perspective:</p><p>• At the highest dose tested (0.6 U/kg), PD results in healthy volunteers suggested potentially lower activity of LY2963016 compared to Lantus, especially in the first hours following injection. However, this observation was largely driven by a single subject, for whom no plausible physiological explanation could be found, and a post-hoc analysis without this single outlier showed comparable effects taking into account the small size of this supportive study.</p><p>• To further confirm the similarity of the PD effects at high doses, an additional analysis of the self-monitored blood glucose profiles was performed in both clinical studies; it showed comparable glucose levels with LY2963016 and Lantus in the subgroup of patients receiving insulin doses ≥ 0.6 U/kg/d, in particular during the first hours following the injection.</p></div>

A survival type of analysis was carried out and, using a Cox proportional hazard model, the hazard ratio (LY2963016/Lantus) was 1.063 with a p-value = 0.8777, supporting the conclusion that there does not appear to be a significant difference in the duration of action between LY2963016 and Lantus.
