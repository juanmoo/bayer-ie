<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.5.">Management</head><p>Limited treatment options are available. Local therapies often relieve typical symptoms for the duration of their application. Atopic dermatitis is treated primarily with topical corticosteroids (TCS). However, continuous long-term application of TCS, particularly those with higher potency, is not recommended, because of side effects such as skin atrophy, HPA axis suppression and others. The majority of patients with mild AD respond well to topical therapy. However, patients with moderate-to-severe AD often do not achieve adequate control with acceptable doses of topical medications and frequently require systemic therapy. Systemic therapy is indicated in patients who do not respond adequately to topical therapies or for whom topical therapy is inadvisable. Currently available systemic therapies include nonselective immunosuppressants such as systemic corticosteroids or Ciclosporin A, which are associated with severe toxicity and side effects.</p><p>The manufacture of dupilumab AS represents a standard manufacturing process for the manufacture of monoclonal antibodies. It is achieved in three main parts, the upstream process, which produces the antibody, the downstream process, which purifies the antibody and the formulation of the active substance (formulated active substance-FAS).</p><p>Dupilumab is produced by a cell culture process with recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that have been engineered to constitutively express dupilumab heavy and light chains. Dupilumab protein is expressed by the cells and is secreted into the culture medium.</p><p>The recombinant protein product is harvested and purified leveraging standard chromatographic and membrane based techniques and includes several steps ensuring adventitious agent safety.</p><p>At the conclusion of purification, the AS is sterile-filtered and dispensed for long-term storage until needed for formulation.</p><p>Dupilumab FAS is produced at a final concentration of 150 mg/mL. The AS batches are thawed, pooled and mixed. This is followed by mixing with dilution buffer and excipient buffer, filtration and further mixing. The dupilumab FAS is then dispensed into bottles with caps and transferred to storage until shipment to the finished product (FP) filling site.</p><p>The ranges of critical process parameters and the routine in-process controls along with acceptance criteria, including controls for microbial purity and endotoxin, where relevant, are described for each step for AS and FAS. A cumulative assessment of risk and importance was performed.</p><p>The applicant has provided a description of the composition and preparation of all buffers and solutions listed in this section as well as chromatography/filter conditions. The AS and FAS manufacturing processes are considered acceptable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Control of materials</head><p>The antibody is produced in CHO cells. The anti-IL4Rα antibody, dupilumab, was generated by immunization of Regeneron's VelocImmune® mice followed by screening for antibodies specific to human IL4Rα. One antibody was chosen and DNA encoding the antibody variable domains was cloned to yield the fully human antibody dupilumab. The cDNA encoding the dupilumab heavy chain and light chain genes was then cloned into expression plasmids and transfected into a CHO host cell line. After transfection and stable integration of the dupilumab expression plasmids into the host cell genome, enabling the constitutive expression of dupilumab, the dupilumab expression cell line was isolated using Regeneron's proprietary cell expression technologies.</p><p>The dupilumab MCB will be used to generate new WCBs for routine production of dupilumab AS. An appropriate number of vials were manufactured, cryopreserved and stored at three separate facilities.</p><p>Three dupilumab WCBs have been prepared from the MCB. The WCB first used in manufacturing AS and used for the manufacturing of dupilumab AS for Phase 3 clinical trials will continue to be used for routine commercial manufacturing, as available. New WCBs were prepared and a protocol for generation &amp; qualification of new WCBs has been provided. Adventitious agent testing of the MCB and WCB was conducted, as per ICH Q5A requirements. The genetic stability of dupilumab production cell line was investigated through the MCB and WCB cell banking process. No evidence of viral or microbial contamination was observed.</p><p>Incoming raw materials (chemical materials, chromatography resins and filters) are adequately controlled (acceptable specifications have been provided for all raw materials). Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, while specifications for noncompendial raw materials are presented. A leachable/extractable risk assessment was performed for all materials used in dupilumab AS and FAS manufacturing processes. The dupilumab manufacturing Assessment report EMA/512262/2017 Page 12/100 process does not use raw materials of direct animal origin, other than CHO cells. TSE/BSE certificates were provided, as applicable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Control of critical steps and intermediates</head><p>All AS and FAS manufacturing processes steps include controls within the IPC program for assurance of operational and performance consistency, as well as adherence to product safety requirements for each step.</p><p>When evaluating parameters and attributes for inclusion in the IPC program, a process failure modes and effects analysis (PFMEA) approach was applied. Potential failure modes were rated on a 1 to 10 scale for severity, likelihood and detectability, with higher scores representing higher relative risk. The product of the severity, likelihood, and detectability scores was calculated, generating a risk priority number (RPN). Failure modes were sorted from highest (greatest risk) to lowest (lowest risk) RPN.</p><p>Once a parameter or attribute was chosen for inclusion in the IPC program, it was formally classified as either a critical quality attribute (CQA), a critical process parameter (CPP) a general quality attribute (GQA) or a general process parameter (GPP).</p><p>All quality attributes monitored at AS and FAS release are considered CQAs. GPPs and GQAs were assigned action limits and CPPs and CQAs were assigned acceptance criteria. Actions taken if limits are exceeded are specified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Process validation</head><p>All key components of the commercial Dupilumab AS and FAS manufacturing processes were prospectively evaluated and validated through laboratory and full scale studies.</p><p>Two Dupilumab AS manufacturing processes have been validated, the commercial processes and an earlier process for some of the clinical studies. The two processes differ only in certain downstream purification steps</p><p>In general, acceptance criteria for all critical parameters and attributes were met for cell culture, unprocessed bulk material, harvest and purification process steps and released batches.</p><p>The applicant has also performed validation of the FAS manufacturing process. A variety of values for operational parameters have been used in order to establish their acceptable range. Release data for PPQ FAS lots have been provided. All batches met acceptance criteria in place at the time of testing.</p><p>The dupilumab process-related impurity clearance studies provide evidence of the robust, reproducible process-related impurity clearance capability of the downstream purification process. All AS lots produced during investigation of PPQs met the release specifications at the time for all product-related impurities. In conclusion, the AS and FAS manufacturing process has been validated adequately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characterisation</head><p>Dupilumab AS lots were characterised, including determination of primary, secondary, and tertiary structure, charge variants, purity, and potency.</p><p>For product-related impurities, the applicant has provided adequate description of their characterisation, their effect on the potency of the product and their control strategy, during manufacture, at release and over the intended shelf life of the product.</p><p>Process-related impurities were adequately described and clearance capabilities of the manufacturing process shown. Sound rationale has been provided for not testing some process-related impurities.</p><p>These are based on in-process testing data, assessment of worst case scenario and recommended acceptable daily exposure levels. The process-related impurities that are not routinely tested for are common to both the commercial and clinical processes and therefore have been present in clinical trial material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specification</head><p>The specifications for Dupilumab AS and FAS are provided and cover control of identity, purity and impurities, potency and other general tests.</p><p>The process used for setting and justification of specifications and specification ranges and limits has been adequately described. In brief, clinically-qualified values were used where possible. The applicant also leveraged historical data from AS and FAS lots by establishing tolerance interval limits. Stability data was used to support end-of-shelf specifications.</p><p>Parameters and acceptance criteria of FAS specifications are acceptable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytical methods</head><p>The analytical procedures have been provided for testing the AS and formulated AS at release and during stability and are sufficiently described in the dossier and validated.</p><p>The potency assay is performed as an AS, FAS and bulk PFS release test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Batch analysis</head><p>Dupilumab FAS includes several formulations examined in clinical trials, as well as the commercial FAS composition.</p><p>Results of batch release testing demonstrated that the commercial manufacturing process is capable of producing AS and FAS of consistent and comparable quality at the time of batch release. The applicant has additionally demonstrated the comparability of dupilumab AS manufactured by earlier iterations of the manufacturing process supplying clinical trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reference materials</head><p>Dupilumab primary and working reference standards are qualified using AS and FAS release testing as well as additional characterisation. A current in-house primary reference standard has been appropriately characterised and is prepared from a lot representative of production and clinical materials. In-house working reference standards used in the testing of production lots are calibrated against this primary reference material. Future RS material will be qualified and characterised as above according to a defined process. Also, distinct reference materials for process-related impurities have been established and described sufficiently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability</head><p>The stability results indicate that the AS and FAS are sufficiently stable and justify the proposed shelf lives in the proposed containers.</p><p>Dupilumab AS and FAS stability studies have been carried out according to ICH recommended long term and accelerated storage conditions. Test articles are packaged in small scale packaging that acceptably simulates that used for long term storage of dupilumab AS. The representative real-time stability is based on AS batches and FAS batches produced with the commercial process. Supportive long-term stability studies were also provided.</p><p>The applicant committed to complete the stability studies of the primary and supporting dupilumab AS and FAS batches at the long-term storage condition according to the stability protocols provided. In accordance with EU GMP guidelines 1 , any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA.</p><p>The forced degradation study confirmed that the current control strategy used for release and stability testing of dupilumab is appropriate and that the methods are capable of detecting the most prominent degradation pathways.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparability exercise for Active Substance</head><p>Four production processes have been used to produce dupilumab for clinical studies.</p><p>The applicant has adequately outlined the development of the commercial process from earlier processes and has demonstrated comparability with material from these earlier batches used in clinical trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Finished Medicinal Product</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description of the product and pharmaceutical development</head><p>The FP is supplied as a single-use prefilled syringe (PFS) or prefilled syringe assembled with a safety system (PFS-S), containing 2.0 mL of 150 mg/mL dupilumab for subcutaneous injection.</p><p>The content of 2 mL of the PFS or PFS-S is intended to be injected, providing a 300 mg dose of dupilumab. The PFS presentation is comprised of a primary container, referred to as a "bulk prefilled syringe", a transparent plunger rod and a white finger flange to facilitate handling. The bulk PFS is a siliconized, 2.25 mL, clear glass syringe barrel, equipped with a stainless steel 27 gauge needle, an elastomeric plunger stopper and a needle shield. The PFS-S presentation includes a safety system for sharps injury prevention, consisting of a needle guard with a spring for activation. All excipients used in the manufacture of dupilumab FAS/FP are known pharmaceutical ingredients and are compendial grade (Ph.Eur.).</p><p>The product has undergone a development process to optimise the formulation and the studies which underpin the choice of formulation are well described in the dossier. Several FP dosage forms were used to supply dupilumab clinical studies.</p><p>In addition to the change in presentation, the formulation was adapted over time. Formulation development is adequately described.</p><p>Extractable and leachable studies have been carried out on material with comes into contact with the finished product during manufacture and storage. Data has been presented to show that the FP is compatible with the chosen container closure system. The container closure system has been shown to comply with the essential requirements of Annex 1 of the Medical Devices Directive and conforms with the relevant ISO requirements.</p><p>As part of the microbial attributes, sterility and endotoxin testing is monitored during batch release testing. The results of the container closure integrity tests demonstrate that the container closure system maintains the sterility of the product and that manufacturing operations and shipping do not impact the container closure integrity. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacture of the product and process controls</head><p>Dupilumab FAS is supplied frozen and stored until manufacturing of the dupilumab FP.</p><p>The manufacturing process is relatively straightforward and involves thawing of formulated AS, pooling and mixing. The FP is then filtered, filled into syringes and fitted with a stopper. At this stage the FP is referred to as bulk pre-filled syringe (PFS). The final PFS is assembled by inserting a plunger rod and finger flange. The PFS-S presentation also has a safety device attached to the finger flange. The manufacturing process is well described.</p><p>The manufacturing processes and process controls described can be considered suitable for manufacturing of bulk PFS, PFS and PFS-S.</p><p>Validation of the FP manufacturing processes was performed. Overall, the processes can generally be considered adequate to reproducibly produce FP within the defined process parameters. The in-process controls are adequate. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Product specification</head><p>The FP specifications contain a complete list of release tests and acceptance criteria covering product solution properties, identity, strength, purity, potency and syringe with safety system performance properties. The chosen release tests are sufficient to ensure the quality of the FP and are generally in line with ICH Q6B and the Ph. Eur. monograph on monoclonal antibodies for human use. After revision of some acceptance criteria the proposed acceptance criteria are considered sufficiently justified.</p><p>The end-of-shelf-life specification for the dupilumab FP in PFS/PFS-S contains a complete list of stability tests and acceptance criteria covering product, strength, purity, potency and syringe performance properties. Testing at end of shelf life is performed on the finished PFS and PFS-S, respectively.</p><p>Specifications for bulk PFS were set and provided.</p><p>Appropriate specifications are in place for the FP to control product-related impurities. Stated impurities have been present in clinical trial material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytical methods</head><p>The analytical methods are fully validated. Non-compendial methods have been validated in line with ICH guidance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Batch analysis</head><p>Representative-scale batch data has been provided for batches of bulk PFS and PFS from each manufacturing site. Furthermore, batches of PFS-S and clinical batches were provided.</p><p>All PFS and PFS-S batches complied with the release specifications.</p><p>Moreover, acceptance ranges of FP specifications are considered adequately set with regard to the batch analyses results from historic and commercial batches and the justifications on specifications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reference materials</head><p>The reference standard is the same as that used for AS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability of the product</head><p>The proposed shelf life is 15 months at 2 -8° C. Based on available stability data, this shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC, are acceptable.</p><p>Based on the data provided, the proposed shelf life of 15 months at 2 -8° C for the FP is acceptable.</p><p>In accordance with EU GMP guidelines 1 , any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA and the applicant has committed to reporting any confirmed out of trends or failures to conform to stability acceptance criteria at the longterm storage condition of 5 °C within the proposed shelf life, and to evaluate the implications of these data to ensure continued purity, potency, and quality. An out-of-trend stability result is defined as a result or sequence of results that are within the acceptance criterion but are unexpected or atypical,</p><p>given the known analytical variance and the measured attribute's normal change over time.</p><p>Data have been presented to show that if necessary, pre-filled syringes may be kept at room temperature up to 25°C for a maximum of 14 days. After removal from the refrigerator, Dupixent must be used within 14 days or discarded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparability exercise for finished medicinal drug product</head><p>Comparability has been demonstrated between both finished commercial product manufacturing sites which were also used to supply the Phase 3 studies. Comparability data included a statistical comparison of release and stability data which identified no meaningful differences in batches manufactured at both sites. Therefore batches produced at both sites can be considered comparable.</p><p>No formal comparability was presented for earlier lyophilized batches, however as these were used only in Phase I studies, comparability data is not considered necessary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adventitious agents</head><p>TSE compliance has been demonstrated and there is sufficient information provided on the animal derived material used. Relevant certificates of analysis have been provided for animal derived material.</p><p>In general, the viral safety of Dupixent is well addressed. Several steps are taken in order to ensure adventitious agents safety. The cell banking system has been extensively screened for adventitious viruses using a variety of in vitro and in vivo assays. The tests failed to demonstrate the presence of any virus contaminants in the cell banks with the exception of intracellular A type and extracellular C type retrovirus-like particles which are well known to be present in rodent cells; moreover, the dupilumab manufacturing process demonstrates excess capacity to inactivate/remove such virus like particles.</p><p>Dedicated virus safety steps were shown to be effective in removing/inactivating potential viral contaminants. In conclusion, viral and TSE safety has been satisfactorily addressed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary pharmacodynamic studies</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary pharmacology in vitro</head><p>The initial experiments demonstrated that dupilumab had a high affinity for human IL-4Rα, with a KD of 12 pM to the dimeric form of the receptor. However, subsequent surface plasma resonance experiments using the Biacore system suggested a much diminished ability to bind IL-4Rα of mouse or monkey origin. Therefore, surrogate antibodies were generated, REGN1103 and REGN646, which bind to IL-4Rα of mouse and monkey origin respectively. These surrogate antibodies were shown to have affinities in a similar range as that of dupilumab in humans.</p><p>Further in vitro characterisation of dupilumab and the surrogate antibodies was performed. Dupilumab was shown to bind to CD20 positive lymphocytes which was blocked by pre-incubation with excess IL-4. Increased cell surface expression of CD23 was also inhibited by dupilumab in human PBMCs and in the Ramos lymphoma cell line. Inhibition of secretion of TARC, a type 2 chemokine whose secretion is mediated by IL-4 or IL-13, was also inhibited by dupilumab in PBMCs isolated from donors.</p><p>Given that dupilumab is a human IgG4 molecule, Fc-effector function is not expected. In accordance, using cell lines expressing IL-4Rα, no ADCC or CDC activity of dupilumab against target cells could be detected.</p><p>Functional characterisation studies with the surrogate antibodies were also performed. REGN1103, the mouse surrogate antibody, inhibited IL-4-and IL-13-dependent proliferation of cell lines at IC50's of 1.9 nM and 11 pM respectively. Similar experiments to those performed with dupilumab were also performed for REGN646, the monkey surrogate antibody. REGN646 inhibited IL-4 and IL-13-mediated signalling as measured by STAT6 mediated luciferase expression or TARC secretion. Flow cytometry analysis showed a comparable staining pattern of human and monkey lymphocytes by dupilumab and REGN646, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary pharmacology in vivo</head><p>Due to the lack of an in vivo model of atopic dermatitis the proof of principle experiments have been performed using classical models of type 2 immune response which have been shown to be mediated at least in part through signalling via IL-4 and IL-13. To this end, a genetically engineered transgenic mouse was established which expresses human IL-4 and IL-4Rα and was validated as a system in human to evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in vivo. infiltration, reduced in goblet cell metaplasia and less total IgE and HDM-specific IgG1 in serum.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Pharmacokinetics</head><p>The pharmacokinetics of dupilumab were evaluated in single-dose PK studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys after IV and SC administration to provide PK information in the absence of target-mediated clearance. PK/TK of REGN646 were evaluated after single and repeated IV or SC administration in cynomolgus monkeys; TK of REGN1103 was evaluated after SC administration in mice. The SC route is the proposed clinical route of administration.</p><p>PK characteristics of dupilumab after single IV and SC administration in rats and cynomolgus were typical for a monoclonal antibody and consistent with a lack of target binding. In both species, the concentration-time profile of dupilumab was characterized by an initial distribution or absorption phase following IV or SC administration, respectively, followed by a single elimination phase. The mean halflife of dupilumab ranged from 4.8 -7 days in rats and 11.7 to 20.5 days in cynomolgus and was comparable following IV or SC administration. The bioavailability following SC dosing was high (84.2 % in rats, &gt; 92% in cynomolgus).</p><p>PK of REGN646 in cynomolgus was characterized by non-linear kinetics, which is consistent with target-mediated disposition. After single IV administration (ranging from 1 -15 mg/kg), Cmax increased approximately dose-proportionally while AUCinf increased in a greater than doseproportional manner. Elimination of REGN646 was biphasic, with a long β elimination phase and a more rapid terminal target elimination phase. Consistently, the mean beta elimination half-life of REGN646 at serum concentrations above the target-saturation ranged from 7.2 to 9.1 days while the mean terminal elimination half-life was 1.5 -2.1 at concentrations where target-mediated elimination is the primary clearance process. The absolute bioavailability of REGN646 following SC administration was approx. 70.0%. After repeated once weekly doses of 25 and 100 mg/kg/week, accumulation of REGN646 was observed, ranging from 2.2 to 4.6-fold.</p><p>REGN1103 showed non-linear kinetics in mice; increases in exposure were greater than doseproportional at lower doses and approximately dose-proportional at doses ≥ 25 mg/kg/week.</p><p>In accordance with ICH S6 (R1), studies on distribution, metabolism and excretion were not conducted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.4.">Toxicology</head><p>Dupilumab is specific for human IL-4Rα and does not adequately interact with IL-4Rα from non-clinical species. Therefore the toxicity of IL-4Rα blockade was evaluated using surrogate antibodies specific for Assessment report EMA/512262/2017 Page 20/100 cynomolgus or mouse IL-4Rα. The pharmacologic activity of these surrogate antibodies was adequately characterized and is considered comparable to that of dupilumab.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeat dose toxicity</head><p>Repeated dose studies of up to 26 weeks duration were conducted with REGN646 in cynomolgus monkeys. In these studies, once weekly IV or SC treatment with REGN646 at doses up to 100 mg/kg was well tolerated. No REGN646-related adverse effects were noted. Lymphocytic infiltrates were observed at the SC injection sites. These are considered a reaction to injection of high concentration of human protein.</p><p>Of note, no immunological effects of REGN646 were observed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. There were no test-article-related changes in peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations. In addition, there were no treatment-related changes in serum IgM, IgG and IgE, with the exception of the 13-week study. In this study, lower IgE serum levels were observed in individual monkeys who had received saturating doses of REGN646. However, this finding is considered a pharmacologic effect of IL-4Rα</p><p>blockade. Furthermore, REGN646 treatment did not affect the development of an antibody response to immunization with KLH. The primary and secondary IgM and IgG response against KLH in REGN646treated cynomolgus was comparable to that of control animals.</p><p>In summary, no adverse effects were observed in the repeat-dose studies. In all studies, the NOAEL was the highest dose administered and was associated with a Ctrough of 4150 µg/ml and an AUC0-168h of 791,000 µg*h/ml at 100 mg/kg SC in the chronic toxicity study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Carcinogenicity</head><p>No carcinogenicity studies were conducted. However, an assessment of the carcinogenic potential of dupilumab was made based on literature data on the role of the IL-4/IL-13 pathway in tumour development and on non-clinical data for both REGN646 and REGN1103.</p><p>The majority of literature data indicate that IL-4 and IL-13 mediate pro-tumorigenic effects either by directly promoting tumour cell proliferation or indirectly via the activation of immunomodulatory cells.</p><p>Such effects would be inhibited by anti-IL-4Rα treatment. In addition, results from the repeated-dose toxicity studies in mice and cynomolgus do not indicate a carcinogenic risk. The applied weight of evidence approach is in accordance with ICH S6(R1). It can be agreed that chronic treatment with dupilumab is not associated with an increased risk of cancer. In contrast, blockade of IL-4Rα signalling may contribute to inhibition of tumour growth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reproduction Toxicity</head><p>The effect of IL-4Rα inhibition on fertility and early embryonic development was evaluated in mice treated with the surrogate mAb. Subcutaneous administration of REGN1103 to adult male and female mice at 25, 75, or 200 mg/kg/week did not result in any compound-related mortality. There were no REGN1103-related clinical signs, effects on body weight or food consumption, macroscopic observations or microscopic findings. In addition, there were no compound-related effects on mating, fertility, estrous cycling, embryo survival or any of the male reproductive assessments (organ weights). Therefore, dupilumab is not expected to have an effect on fertility.</p><p>In the cynomolgus enhanced pre-/post-natal development study, there were no REGN646-related maternal effects. The incidence of embryo-fetal loss was higher in REGN646-treated groups (32.4% combined 25 and 100 mg/kg groups) than in the control group (25%) but was within the range of historical control data reported at the test facility (6.7 -38.9%). In the surviving offspring, there were no REGN646-related findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.5.">Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment</head><p>Dupilumab is a water soluble monoclonal antibody which undergoes extensive in vivo metabolism. The human excretion products of dupilumab are predicted to be rapidly and readily degraded in sewage collection and treatment systems and in the environment. Therefore, dupilumab is unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.6.">Discussion on non-clinical aspects</head><p>The provided pharmacology studies have demonstrated that dupilumab has a high affinity for the human IL-4Rα receptor and a much lower affinity for IL-4Rα of mouse and monkey origin necessitating the generation of surrogate antibodies. The surrogate antibodies, REGN1103 and REGN646 demonstrated affinities to mouse and monkey IL-4Rα respectively in a comparable, albeit lower, range to that of dupilumab to hIL-4Rα. The staining pattern of human and monkey lymphocytes by dupilumab and REGN646, respectively was comparable. In vitro functionality of these antibodies was demonstrated in cells of the respective species with inhibition of IL-4 or IL-13 dependent signalling.</p><p>Although no preclinical models of atopic dermatitis were available a transgenic mouse expressing hIL-4 and hIL-4Rα was generated and used for proof of efficacy studies with dupilumab in models of type 2 immune responses. Similar in vivo experiments were performed demonstrating efficacy with the mouse surrogate REGN1103 antibody. Taken together the studies provide a comprehensive basis for the potential mechanism of action of dupilumab in atopic dermatitis as well as establishing the appropriateness of the surrogate antibodies for the toxicity studies.</p><p>In rats and monkeys dupilumab exhibited linear kinetics as expected in species that do not bind dupilumab with high affinity. No target-mediated clearance was observed and total dupilumab exposure was approximately dose proportional. In monkeys REGN646, the monkey surrogate anti-IL-4Rα antibody, displayed non-linear kinetics. The concentration-time profiles of REGN646 are characterized by an initial distribution phase following IV administration, or an absorption phase following SC administration, followed by a target-saturating beta elimination phase and a terminal target-mediated elimination phase. The target-mediated elimination is most notable at the lower concentrations. Low volumes of distribution are seen along with long elimination half-life, which are typical pharmacokinetic characteristics of monoclonal Abs. The presence of ADA in animals in the REGN646 monkey study clearly impacted the rate of drug clearance observed in the study especially at lower concentrations, and there was no evidence of toxicity associated with the occurrence of ADA.</p><p>Since dupilumab and the surrogate antibodies, REGN1103 and REGN646, are large proteins that are above the glomerular filtration cut-off threshold, they are primarily eliminated by proteolytic catabolism that results in smaller peptides and amino acids that can be reused for new protein synthesis. The clearance of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies typically does not involve cytochrome P450 (CYP450)-mediated metabolism or interaction with cell membrane transporters, therefore pharmacokinetic interactions with small molecule drugs are limited. However, published literature suggests IL-4 plays a role in the regulation of CYP. The clinical significance of this is unclear. In a Assessment report EMA/512262/2017 Page 22/100 clinical drug-drug interaction study (R668-Ad-1433) in AD patients, the effects of dupilumab on the PK of CYP substrates were evaluated. The data generated from this study did not indicate clinically relevant effects of dupilumab on CYP1A2, CYP3A, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP2C9 activity.</p><p>To support the safety of dupilumab, a toxicology programme was conducted in accordance with current guidance and considered adequate. Given the lack of cross-reactivity of dupilumab with IL-4Rα from non-clinical species, surrogate mAbs were used, which is acceptable. The repeated-dose toxicity studies IL-4Rα blockade did not reveal any adverse effects. Given that the toxicity studies were conducted with a surrogate antibody a direct comparison of exposure multiples in the toxicity studies with exposure of dupilumab in humans is not considered meaningful. However, the Ctrough at the end of treatment in the chronic toxicity study corresponds to 52x of IC90 determined for REGN646mediated inhibition of IL-4-stimulated TARC section in vitro. This indicates that a sufficiently high exposure to REGN646 was maintained throughout the study.</p><p>The effect of IL-4Rα blockade on reproductive and developmental toxicity was evaluated in a fertility study in mice which and in an ePPND study in cynomolgus monkeys. No adverse effects were noted.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.2.">Pharmacokinetics</head><p>The PK of dupilumab in healthy subjects has been evaluated in three Phase I studies (R668-AS-0907, R668-HV-1108 and TDU12265) and three formulation comparison studies (Study PKM12350, PKM14161, PKM14271). Population PK analysis has also been conducted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Absorption</head><p>Dupilumab is generally well absorbed following SC administration with an absolute bioavailability of 64% based on population PK analysis. After a single SC administration of 75 mg to 600 mg dupilumab, the median tmax was 3 to 7 days in healthy subjects.</p><p>Steady-state is generally achieved by week 16 for both the 300 mg Q2W and 300 mg QW dosing.</p><p>Comparison of the mean concentration-time profiles for both R668-AD-1224 where dosing with 300 mg Q2W and 300 mg QW was maintained for 52 weeks, and R668-AD-1225 where mean data from the 300 mg QW regimen up to 68 weeks are available, suggests that the steady-state trough concentrations achieved by week 16 are in the range of those measured in other studies and are maintained for up to 1 year. A very slight increase in mean Ctrough values (R668-AD-1225) could be detected.</p><p>After 51 weeks of dosing in study R668-AD-1224, mean Ctrough was 78.6 mg/L and 188 mg/L for the 300 Q2W and 300 mg QW regimens, respectively. Generally, Ctrough values showed a high variability with a standard deviation from the mean of about 40 (Q2W) and over 70 (QW). The 600 mg loading dose enabled a more rapid increase in exposure allowing approximately 75% of the steady-state concentration to be reached by week 4.</p><p>Mean trough concentration of functional dupilumab in serum were consistent across studies conducted using similar dosing regimens in patients with moderate-severe AD.</p><p>In conclusion, the PK of dupilumab is characterized as nonlinear with target-mediated clearance.</p><p>Following different dosing regimens of both IV and SC administration, the concentration-time profile of functional dupilumab was characterized by an initial distribution phase (IV) or absorption phase (SC, F = 0.642) followed by a bi-phasic elimination. Bioavailability F was estimated based on population PK analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distribution</head><p>In study TDU12265, following a single SC dose of 75 mg to 600 mg of dupilumab, the estimated apparent steady-state volume of distribution ranged from 6.6 L to 10.7 L. Based on POP PK analysis, the central volume of distribution (V2) was 2.74 L and peripheral volume of distribution (V3) was 1.86 L, resulting in a total volume of distribution of 4.6 L. This small volume of distribution is in line with what is expected from a monoclonal antibody.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Elimination</head><p>As a monoclonal antibody, the metabolism of dupilumab is expected to be limited to proteolytic catabolism to small peptides and individual amino acids; eliminated by kidneys is not expected. Hence no metabolism or excretion studies were conducted. Clearance via the linear, concentrationindependent elimination pathway was estimated by population PK modelling (central volume *ke). For the typical patients this resulted in a linear clearance estimate of 2.74 L * 0.0477 1/d = 0.131 L/d.</p><p>Total clearance estimates increase as concentration decreases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dose proportionality and time dependency</head><p>Following single administration of dupilumab, a greater-than dose proportional increase in systemic exposure was observed. In healthy volunteers, for a 12-fold increase in IV dose from 1 mg/kg to 12 mg/kg, a 38-fold increase in AUClast was observed. For an 8-fold increase in SC single dose from 75 mg to 600 mg, a 30-fold increase in AUClast was observed in healthy male Japanese subjects. These observations are consistent with nonlinear PK due to target-mediated clearance. Following IV and SC administration Cmax increased in a slightly greater than dose proportional manner. As only sparse samples have been collected from AD patients, the model selection was conducted in a step-wise process aiming at optimal parameter estimation and selection of the best model structure. Based on the population PK analysis, mild to moderate renal impairment (predicted creatinine clearance of &gt;30 ≤ 80 mL/min) did not affect the PK of dupilumab. No formal study was conducted in special populations, such as patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Thus the impact of severely impaired renal and hepatic function on PK is unknown.</p><p>Gender was equally distributed among the study population (F: 41%, M: 59%); no differences in PK have been detected. Race has been identified as significant covariate based on model 4. Comparison of Asian vs. remaining population, African American/Black vs. remaining population and White vs.</p><p>remaining population showed no major differences in individual ke and Vc. The PK of dupilumab was evaluated in healthy Japanese male subjects in study TDU12265. There were no obvious differences in the PK of dupilumab between healthy Japanese and Caucasian subjects (R668-AS-0907). However, a 300 mg single dose resulted in maximum mean dupilumab levels of ~38 mg/L in Japanese male healthy subjects (TDU12265) compared to 30 mg/L in all other healthy subjects at day 7. Results from Assessment report EMA/512262/2017 Page 26/100 the phase 3 study (R668-AD-1334) showed that exposure to functional dupilumab is similar for the subset of Asian AD patients and the non-Asian AD patient population.</p><p>The patients' age ranged from 18 years to 88 years. Only 61 patients were over 65 years of age (Studies R668-AD-1334, R668-1416 and R668-AD-1224). Population PK analysis did not indicate age to affect the PK of dupilumab (Ke, Vc).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacokinetic interaction studies</head><p>As a monoclonal antibody, dupilumab is not anticipated to directly interact with cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes thus no typical drug-drug interactions of dupilumab with other drugs via are expected. It is agreed that no influence of concomitant TCS can be detected based on comparison of PK data from patients involved in monotherapy studies SOLO1 and SOLO2 vs study R668-AD-1224.</p><p>Limited in vitro data suggested that IL-4 and IL-13 may modulate the expression (and potentially the activities) of some CYP isoforms resulting in dysregulated drug metabolism that could influence the exposure of concomitant medications. A clinical study (R668-AD-1433) designed to examine the effects of dupilumab on the PK of selected CYP substrates in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD has been completed. This study did not indicate clinically relevant effects of dupilumab on CYP1A2, CYP3A, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP2C9 activity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanism of action</head><p>The pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis is influenced by genetics and environmental factors and involves a complex interplay between antigens, skin barrier defects, and immune dysregulation, in which a polarized inflammatory response induced by the marked activation of the Type 2/T-helper type 2 (Th2) cell axis plays a central role. The primary skin defect may be an immunologic disturbance that causes IgE-mediated sensitization, with epithelial-barrier dysfunction that is the consequence of both genetic mutations and local inflammation.</p><p>Two cytokines, interleukin (IL)-4 (IL-4) and IL-13, are critical in the initiation and maintenance of the type2/Th2 inflammatory pathway. Downstream effects of IL-4 and IL-13 are dependent on IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα) signaling, which is inhibited by dupilumab. Dupilumab is a recombinant human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the alpha sub-unit of the Type I and II interleukin-4 receptors (IL-4Rα). Dupilumab inhibits IL-4 signaling via the Type I receptor (IL-4Rα/γc), and both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through the Type II receptor (IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary and Secondary pharmacology</head><p>The Type2/Th2 cytokines produced by skin-infiltrating leukocytes, including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, act on keratinocytes and other cell types to induce production of chemokines, including chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 17 (CCL17, also known as thymus and activation regulated chemokine [TARC]) and CCL26 (eotaxin-3), which are chemo attractants for Th2 cells and eosinophils. In vitro, dupilumab blocks TARC and eotaxins 3 induction by IL-4 and IL-13 in human blood. In addition, both IL-4 and IL-13 are present at elevated levels in individuals with allergic disease including AD. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was also used as a PD biomarker and was determined in all studies as part of the standard laboratory testing. The PD of dupilumab was assessed in phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3 studies. Immunogenicity was assessed in all studies. week 16 in the R668-AD-1224 study; however, the proportion of patients was low (8.2% for the 300 mg QW group, 6.7% for the 300 mg Q2W group compared to 1.4% for the placebo group). After 52 weeks of treatment, total IgE was normalized in 11.7% and 15.9% of patients receiving dupilumab 300 mg Q2W and 300 mg QW, respectively, compared to 4.4% of patients receiving placebo.</p><p>Almost all patients treated with dupilumab achieved normal LDH at both week 16 and week 52 compared to approximately 50% of patients in the placebo group.</p><p>The percent change from baseline in LDH, TARC, and total IgE at week 16 for the 300 mg Q2W and 300 mg QW dose regimens for patients in the following weight categories: &lt;70 kg, ≥70 to &lt;100 kg, and ≥100 kg has been assessed. Data indicate that there are only small differences in mean PD response between patients in the different body weight groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunogenicity</head><p>Immunogenicity assessments and monitoring were performed for all clinical studies. Overall, ADA incidence throughout the studies is rather low and comparable among the treatment groups. In the 16-week studies, approximately 7% of subjects treated with DUPIXENT and 2% of subjects on placebo developed antibodies to dupilumab, while in the 52-week study, approximately 7% of subjects treated with DUPIXENT + TCS and 8% of subjects on placebo + TCS developed antibodies to dupilumab.</p><p>Majority of the ADA positive patients exhibited low titers (&lt;1000). Less than 2% of patients treated with dupilumab + TCS and 3% of patients treated with placebo + TCS exhibited ADA positive responses lasting more than 12 weeks. Except in a few cases with high ADA titers, development of anti-drug antibodies was generally not associated with loss of efficacy. Of the subjects that developed antibodies in the 16-week studies, approximately 2% of all subjects treated with DUPIXENT and approximately 0.5% of all subjects on placebo had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing. Of the subjects that developed antibodies in the 52-week study, approximately 1% of all subjects treated with DUPIXENT and approximately 0.7% of all subjects on placebo had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exposure-Response</head><p>In order to investigate the relationship of measures of drug exposure with response, the exposureresponse relationships for the efficacy endpoints (EASI, pruritus Numerical Rating Scale [NRS],</p><p>Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA]) were also assessed for both dupilumab trough concentration and AUC. The relationship between dupilumab exposure and its effects on the following adverse event (AE) terms was also assessed: Conjunctivitis (narrow), Herpes Simplex, and Herpes through empirical exposure-response analyses that utilized dupilumab concentration from week 0 to week 16 vs incidence of these AEs from baseline to week 16.</p><p>Exposure-response analyses were conducted using pooled data from the phase 3 monotherapy studies in order to evaluate the influence of drug concentration on the efficacy and safety of dupilumab; study R668-AD-1224 (long-term treatment [LTT]) was analyzed separately as patients were treated with concomitant topical corticosteroids (TCS).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exposure -Efficacy Relationship</head><p>No notable difference is observed when comparing mean percent change from baseline EASI score, the proportion of patients achieving IGA 0-1 and the mean percent change from baseline for peak pruritus Assessment report EMA/512262/2017 Page 28/100 NRS for the 300 mg Q2W and 300 mg QW treatment regimens. This analysis found the majority of patients responded well to dupilumab treatment in all 3 studies (R668-AD-1334, R668-AD-1416, R668-AD-1224), whether using a 300 mg Q2W or 300 mg QW regimen. At week 16 when the primary endpoint was assessed, there was no notable difference in mean PD efficacy response between the 300 mg Q2W and the 300 mg QW treatment regimens, thus, no dose-response relationship with regard to efficacy is detectable including the long-term treatment study.</p><p>Despite this apparent lack of a dose-response relationship based on mean PD data, the quartile analysis of dupilumab-treated patients from the two phase 3 mono-therapy studies showed a clear exposure-response relationship. With quartiles based on Ctrough at week 16, the lowest quartile of exposure resulted in a smaller reduction from baseline in EASI score (70%) than the highest quartile (81%). Addressing the 300 QW and 300 Q2W regimens separately, a consistent trend of increasing reduction in EASI with increasing quartile of exposure between Q1 and Q4 could be detected. Trends remain when assessing exposure-efficacy by AUC0-112. Similarly, the proportion of patients achieving IGA 0-1 increased from 37.1% to 56.6% for the lowest and highest quartile of dupilumab concentrations at day 112, with a consistent difference when assessed by Ctrough or AUC0-112 and dosing regimens separately. The E/R relationship based on NRS is similar but notably shallower than that observed based on e.g. EASI score, which showed an 11% difference between Q4 and Q1.</p><p>Subgroup analysis with focus on body weight showed that for both EASI and IGA, a greater improvement was observed in the lowest quartile of body weight than in the highest quartile. For patients in the lowest quartile of body weight (&lt;64 kg), the mean percent improvement in EASI score at week 16 was 76.2%, in contrast to a mean improvement of 70.7% for patients in the highest quartile of body weight (&gt;88.5 kg). In the lowest quartile of body weight, 51.9% of patients achieved IGA 0-1 compared to 39.8% in the highest quartile of body weight. When assessed across the quartiles Q3 to Q1, the impact of body weight on response is far less. Thus, the overall body weight effect on exposure accounts for a great portion of the overall E/R relationship, while the majority of patients treated with 300 mg Q2W receive significant and possible their own maximal treatment benefit. Some patients (in the highest body weight quartile) may receive some additional benefit from the higher exposure associated with the more intense 300 mg QW treatment regimen.</p><p>Population exposure-efficacy analysis selected BMI (or body weight) on baseline response (E0) as major covariate based on a Emax model that has been established only for the EASI score efficacy parameter. EC50 values for Ctrough and AUC were estimated to 30 mg/L and 5570 mg*day/L, respectively. EC50 Ctrough level is achieved among all bodyweight groups, while the selected AUClevel is far beyond the AUC values reached in any body weight group. No conclusions should be drawn based on the EC50 levels as they have been estimated with large confidence intervals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exposure -Safety Relationship</head><p>The descriptive exposure-response analysis for safety illustrated that the adverse events identified in the phase 3 studies (conjunctivitis, herpes simplex, and oral herpes) were balanced across the quartiles of exposure and no exposure-response relationship could be identified, given the limitations of the safety data.</p></div>

For the envisaged dosing regimen, the applicant was asked to calculate t1/2 considering non-linear kinetics and targetmediated effects to be stated in the SmPC for the exposure range (Cmin_ss, Cmax_ss) in the steady state.</p><p>The 600 mg loading dose enabled a more rapid increase in exposure allowing approximately 75% of the steady-state concentration to be reached by week 4.</p><p>Using data from 5000 subjects, the applicant has used the PK population model to estimate the predicted mean Cmax,SS for both the 300 mg Q2W and 300 mg QW doses of dupilumab. Samples collected from the clinical trials constituted a comprehensive dataset allowing a proper characterization of the PK of dupilumab in the relevant patient population. Low fluctuations between trough and Cmax levels were predicted for both dosing regimens and were adequately justified based on low clearance at target-saturating concentrations.</p><p>A clinical study (R668-AD-1433) designed to examine the effects of dupilumab on the PK of selected CYP substrates in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD has been completed The results did not indicate clinically relevant effects of dupilumab on CYP1A2, CYP3A, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP2C9 activity.</p><p>The chosen PD biomarkers and response parameters are deemed plausible and indicate a proof of concepts. Dupilumab showed no dose-response relationship but a clear exposure response relationship with regard to efficacy. Some patients (in the highest body weight quartile characterized by the lowest exposure) may receive some additional benefit from the higher exposure associated with the more intense 300 mg QW treatment regimen.</p><p>Rates of ADA and NAb development appear to be low with dupilumab, with a higher incidence seen in subjects who were administered lower doses of dupilumab or those who received Q2W doses rather than QW doses. Less than 2% of patients treated with dupilumab and 3% of patients treated with placebo exhibited positive responses in the ADA assay that last more than 12 weeks. Of these positive samples, the majority exhibited low titers (&lt;1000) and the distribution of dupilumab concentrations was within the range observed for patients who exhibited negative responses in the ADA assay at all times.</p><p>Two patients treated with 300 mg QW, positive in the ADA assay at week 16 with high titers and also positive in the NAb assay had reductions in serum dupilumab concentrations temporally associated with the development of ADA and lost efficacy over time. Neutralizing antibodies were not generally associated with loss of efficacy, except in patients who exhibited high titer ADA responses. Positive responses in the ADA assay were generally not associated with an impact on exposure, safety or efficacy. In the overall exposure pool, less than 0.1% of patients exhibited high titer ADA responses associated with reduced exposure and efficacy. In general, there does not appear to be a marked impact on efficacy scores in subjects who develop ADAs or NAbs. Longer term data are required to characterise the risk of ADA/NAb persistence.</p><p>It is noted that rates of anti-drug antibody development in the 3 formulation comparison studies in healthy volunteers (and in particular studies PKM14161 and PKM14271) were higher than those seen in the Phase II and III clinical trials.</p></div>

All patients received a loading dose on day 1 (600 mg for all 300 mg dose regimens and 400 mg for the 100 mg and 200 mg dose regimens). The target population was adults with moderate-to-severe AD that could not be adequately controlled with topical medications or for whom topical treatment was otherwise inadvisable (e.g., side effects or safety risks).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background Treatment</head><p>All patients were required to apply emollients at least twice daily for at least the 7 consecutive days immediately before randomization and to continue throughout the study for 64 weeks. All types of emollients were permitted, but patients could not initiate treatment with prescription moisturizers or moisturizers containing additives during the screening period or during the study. Patients could have continued using stable doses of prescription emollients if initiated before the screening visit.</p><p>Starting on day 1 all patients were required to initiate treatment with TCS. A medium potency TCS was applied once daily to areas with active lesions. A low potency TCS was used once daily on areas of thin skin (face, neck, intertriginous, and genital areas, areas of skin atrophy, etc.) or for areas where continued treatment with medium potency TCS was considered unsafe.</p><p>After lesions were under control (clear or almost clear), treatment was switched from medium potency to low potency TCS once daily for 7 days, then stopped. If lesions returned, treatment with medium potency TCS was reinstituted, with the step-down approach described above upon lesion resolution.</p><p>For lesions persisting or worsening under once daily treatment with medium potency TCS, patients were treated (rescued) with high or super-high potency TCS, unless higher potency TCS were considered unsafe. Rescue treatment with systemic therapy (systemic corticosteroids, systemic nonsteroidal immunosuppressants) was also permitted after Week 2. If a patient received rescue treatment with systemic corticosteroids or nonsteroidal systemic immunosuppressive/ immunomodulating drugs, study treatment was temporarily discontinued. After the treatment with these medications was completed, study treatment could be resumed, but not sooner than 5 half-lives after the last dose of systemic rescue medication.</p><p>The patients were monitored for signs of local or systemic TCS toxicity and treatment was stepped down or stopped, as necessary.</p><p>Type and amount of the TCS and TCI used was determined by weighing the tube at each visit, which was recorded.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab administered concomitantly with TCS through week 16 in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD compared to placebo administered concomitantly with TCS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary Objectives</head><p>The secondary objectives of the study were to: The research objective was to assess the relationship between long-term exposure to dupilumab and potential biomarkers of AD and response to treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcomes/endpoints</head><p>The co-primary endpoints were proportion of patients with EASI-75 at week 16 and with both IGA 0 or 1 and a reduction of ≥ 2 points at week 16. Key secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients with improvement (≥ 4 points) of weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS from baseline to week 2, 4 and 16, reduction ≥ 3 points of weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS from baseline to week 16, the percent change from baseline to week 16 in weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS and EASI-75 and IGA 0 or 1 at week 52.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample size</head><p>The sample size was chosen to allow for an adequate characterization of the long-term safety profile of dupilumab. With 300, 100, and 300 patients in the dupilumab 300 mg QW, dupilumab 300 mg Q2W, and placebo groups, respectively, there was about 99% power in both primary efficacy comparisons (dupilumab 300 mg QW vs placebo and dupilumab 300 mg Q2W vs. placebo, each comparison performed at alpha = 0.025, 2-sided) to detect a difference of 29% between dupilumab and placebo regarding IGA response at week 16, assuming response rates of 38% (dupilumab) and 9% (placebo).</p><p>This sample size also provides 99% power with regard to EASI-75 response in both comparisons assuming response rates at week 16 of 58% (dupilumab) and 15% (placebo). The assumptions were based on results from a phase 2 study, R668-AD-1117. To account for drop outs approximately 700 patients were planned to be enrolled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Randomisation</head><p>The subjects were randomized in a 3:1:3 ratio (dupilumab 300 mg QW: 300 mg Q2W : placebo). In all studies randomization was stratified by disease severity (IGA 3 vs IGA 4) and region (Asia Pacific, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and North and South America).</p><p>In each study randomization was performed according to a central randomization scheme provided by an interactive voice response system (IVRS)/interactive web response system (IWRS).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Blinding (masking)</head><p>The pivotal studies were double blind. With the exception of the IVRS/IWRS statistician (providing the randomization), the IDMC statistician and the IDMC members, and except for the provisions for emergency unblinding, all studies remained blinded until the pre-specified unblinding to conduct the primary analyses in each study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical methods</head><p>In all studies data were described by means of statistical characteristics <ref type="formula">(</ref> For the 3 pivotal studies the primary efficacy analyses were performed on the full analysis set (FAS) of all patients randomized, as well as on the per protocol set (PPS) excluding patients with major protocol violations as a supporting analysis. The primary (null-) hypotheses of no difference between each of the dupilumab groups and placebo was tested by means of a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusted by randomization strata (region, disease severity). For each comparison both co-primary endpoints (IGA response at week 16 and EASI-75 response at week 16) had to be statistically significant (at the 2.5%-level, 2-sided) in order to declare the corresponding dupilumab group superior to placebo. To account for missing values / intake of rescue medication, patients were counted as non-responder for the time points after withdrawal / first use of rescue medication.</p><p>Binary secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed using the same approach as that used for the analysis of the primary endpoints. If a patient had a missing value at a given week, they were counted as a non-responder for that week.</p><p>The continuous endpoints were analysed using multiple imputation (MI) with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. Patients' efficacy data after rescue treatment usage were set to missing first, and were then imputed by the MI method.</p><p>In addition to the method described above, various sensitivity analyses for the continuous endpoints for EASI and/or Pruritus NRS were conducted:</p><p>1. An analysis based on all observed data no matter if rescue treatment is used or data is collected after withdrawal using the MI method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>A mixed-effect model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis (initially planned as main analysis for continuous data for EU and Japan) including factors (fixed effects) for treatment, baseline strata, visit, baseline value, treatment-by-visit interaction, and baseline-by-visit interaction as covariates. An unstructured covariance matrix was used to model the within-patient errors. Efficacy data were set to missing after rescue treatment. The MMRM model was to be implemented for two sets of analyses separately:</p><p>a. Endpoints at week 16 by including data up to week 16 b. Endpoints at week 52 by including all data up to week 52</p><p>3. An ANCOVA model, including the treatment group, the baseline value and the randomization strata where efficacy data were set to missing after use of rescue medication. The post-baseline LOCF method was then to be used to impute missing values.</p><p>4. An ANCOVA model, including the treatment group, the baseline value and the randomization strata where efficacy data were set to missing after use of rescue medication. The post-baseline worstobserved-case-forward (WOCF) method was then be used to impute missing values.</p><p>5.</p><p>An ANCOVA model, including study, the treatment group, the baseline value and the randomization strata based on all observed value regardless rescue medication used. No imputation method was to be applied for the sensitivity analysis.</p><p>To control for multiplicity regarding the testing of secondary endpoints only if both co-primary endpoints were significant, the secondary endpoints were to be tested following the hierarchical testing procedure with a pre-specified order, i.e. inferential conclusions about secondary endpoints required statistical significance at the 0.025 significance level (2-sided) of the prior ones. Safety data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Safety analyses were based on study specific safety analysis set (SAF).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcomes/endpoints</head><p>The co-primary endpoints were proportion of patients with EASI-75 at week 16 and with both IGA 0 or1 and a reduction of ≥2 points at week 16. Key secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients with improvement (reduction ≥ 4 points) of weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS from baseline to week 2, 4 and 16, reduction ≥ 3 points of weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS from baseline to</p><p>week 16, the percent change from baseline to week 16 in weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample size</head><p>To detect a difference of 29% between dupilumab and placebo regarding IGA response (i.e. IGA score of 0 to 1) at week 16, assuming response rates of 38% (dupilumab) and 9% (placebo), 55 subjects per group were required in order to achieve 90% power (alpha = 0.025, 2-sided). To ensure that sufficient safety information was collected, and to ensure that a sufficient number of responders would be available for inclusion in the maintenance study, the sample size was increased to 200 subjects per group, i.e. 600 subjects in total. With 200 subjects per group, the study would provide 99% power in both comparisons (dupilumab 300 mg QW vs. placebo treatment, and dupilumab 300 mg Q2W vs.</p><p>placebo, each comparison performed at alpha = 0.025, 2-sided). These numbers of patients would also provide 99% power to detect a difference of 43% in the proportions of patients achieving EASI-75 response at week 16, assuming that the proportions were 58% (dupilumab) and 15% (placebo).</p></div>

Exploratory objectives in both studies included an assessment of the clinical effect of dupilumab.

Exploratory efficacy assessments included EASI, IGA of AD severity, pruritus NRS, and SCORAD. Higher decreases from baseline in IGA, EASI, pruritus NRS, and SCORAD scores were observed in the dupilumab + TCS group than the placebo + TCS group.</p><p>R668-AD-1117 was a phase 2a, 28-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of SC dupilumab treatment in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean percent reduction in EASI score from baseline to week 12 and was statistically significantly larger in the dupilumab group than in the placebo group. Results from the secondary efficacy analyses also demonstrated a greater reduction in AD severity in the dupilumab group than the placebo group.</p><p>R668-AD-1307 was a phase 2, 32-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy, safety, concentration of functional dupilumab in serum over time, and immunogenicity of SC dupilumab treatment in adults with moderate-to-severe AD that could not be adequately controlled with topical medications or for whom topical treatment was medically inadvisable.</p><p>R668-AD-1314 was a phase 2, 32-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study conducted in the USA to assess T-cell-dependent and T-cell-independent immunization responses, respectively, to tetanus toxoid adsorbed Adacel® (Tdap) and Menomune (meningococcal polysaccrahide) vaccinations in adults with moderate-to-severe AD, who were treated with SC dupilumab. Improvements were seen for absolute and percent changes in peak pruritus NRS, BSA involvement with AD, GISS and POEM scores from baseline to week 16, in the proportions of patients achieving IGA scores of 0 or 1, IGA score reductions ≥ 2 and patients achieving 50% and 75% reductions in EASI scores at week 16.</p><p>R668-AD-1225 is a phase 3, multicenter, open-label, extension study to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of repeat doses of dupilumab in adults with moderate-to-severe AD.</p><p>This study is currently ongoing.

The results of this study were requested due to the patient population of this study and introduction of final manufacturing process.</p><p>The primary endpoint EASI 75 at week 16 was statistically significantly higher in the treated patients versus placebo. The many secondary endpoints which included IGA 0-1 response, PRURITIS, SCORAD, POEM and DLQI were statistically significantly better with dupilumab therapy. Onset of action was rapid, with divergence between dupilumab + TCS and placebo + TCS apparent as early as week 2 for many endpoints. Multiple sensitivity analyses using all observed data confirmed the results of the primary analysis, demonstrating that these outcomes were not driven by the analytic method of categorizing patients who used rescue treatment as non-responders, even though rescue was more common in the placebo + TCS group.  SOLOC-CONTINUE consisted of a 36-week treatment period, during which patients received dupilumab 300 mg QW, Q2W, Q4W, Q8W, or placebo from day 1 (ie, week 16 in the parent studies), and a 12week follow-up period. The co-primary endpoints were i, the mean change between baseline and week 36 in percent change in EASI Score from parent study baseline, and ii, percent of patients with EASI-75 at week 36 for patients with EASI-75 at baseline. Patients who continued on the same dose regimen received in the SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 studies (300 mg Q2W or 300 mg QW) showed the optimal effect in maintaining clinical response while efficacy for other dose regimens diminished in a dosedependent manner.</p></div>

The phase 3 development program of dupilumab in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis consists of 3 pivotal studies with 2 replicate 16 weeks Assessment report EMA/512262/2017</p><p>Page 66/100 monotherapy studies (SOLO 1 R668-AD-1334 and SOLO 2 R688-AD-1416) and a 52-week long-term treatment study of dupilumab with concomitant use of topical medications (CHRONOS R668-AD-1224).</p><p>Two different subcutaneous (SC) dupilumab dosing regimens were evaluated in the phase 3 studies, 300 mg Q2W and 300 mg QW, each with a loading dose of 600 mg on day 1. These doses were selected based on the results of the phase 2b dose ranging study (R668-AD-1021) with the 300 mg QW and 300 mg Q2W regimens demonstrating the highest efficacy.</p><p>Study R668-AD-1224 (Chronos) consisted of a 35 days long screening phase, including wash out of treatments for AD, a 52-week treatment phase and a 12 week follow up period. At baseline 740 patients were randomized in a 3:1:3 ratio to receive dupilumab 300 mg SC QW or Q2W, following the loading dose on day 1, or matching placebo. All patients also received TCS using a standardized predefined regimen. Randomization was stratified by baseline disease severity and by region. The end of treatment period visit occurred at week 52, 1 week after the last dose of study drug. Follow-up visits occurred week 64 (EOS).</p><p>Dupilumab as monotherapy was studied in the pivotal 16-week studies R668-AD-1334 (SOLO 1) and</p><p>R668-AD-1416 (SOLO 2). The design of both studies was identical. The studies consisted of a 35 day screening phase, a 16 week treatment phase and a 12 week safety follow up. In R668-AD-1334 671 patients and in R668-AD-1416 708 patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive SC 300 mg dupilumab QW, 300 mg dupilumab Q2W (each with the loading dose of 600 mg) or matching placebo.</p><p>The design of the studies is considered adequate to assess short term efficacy.</p><p>The eligibility criteria were adequate for the inclusion of patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and comparable across the clinical studies with little modifications for study R669-AD-1224 (Chronos) pertaining to patients being able to safely use TCS, due to the design of the study. The demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar among the treatment groups across the studies and the mean baseline values for all AD assessments were consistent with moderate-to-severe AD. No meaningful imbalances were identified.</p><p>Patients were required either to have a documented recent history (within 6 months before the screening visit) of an inadequate response to treatment with topical medications, or deemed not to be appropriate candidates for such topical therapies (e.g., because of important potential side effects from TCS).</p><p>In the monotherapy studies, patients could have received rescue treatment with an otherwise prohibited medication for treatment of intolerable AD symptoms during the study. In both studies, the proportion of patients who required rescue treatment in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group was similar to the 300 mg QW group (15-23% for dupilumab versus 51-52% placebo). The most commonly used rescue medications in both monotherapy studies were topical corticosteroids. A smaller proportion of patients were rescued with systemic medications than topical medications.</p><p>The co-primary endpoints were proportion of patients with EASI-75 at week 16 and IGA 0 or1 and a reduction of ≥ 2 points at week 16. This is considered adequate to evaluate improvement in atopic dermatitis. Key secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients with improvement (reduction ≥ 4 points or ≥ 3 points) of weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS from baseline to week 2, 4, 16, and the percent change from baseline to week 16. The endpoints were similar for all three pivotal studies. Study R668-AD-1415 was a study conducted in a subset of patients who achieved high-level clinical response (IGA(0,1) or EASI-75) after 16-week treatment in one of the initial-treatment (parent) studies (SOLO 1 R668-AD-1334 and SOLO 2 R668-AD-1416). Its purpose was to assess efficacy and safety of continuation of the dupilumab dose regimens (300 mg Q2W or QW) administered in the initial treatment studies compared with dose frequency reductions (to Q4W or Q8W) and dose withdrawal (discontinue dupilumab to receive placebo).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy data and additional analyses</head><p>A serial gatekeeping procedure with alpha split between the 2 dose regimens was used to test the primary and key secondary endpoints while controlling for multiplicity in each of the phase 3 studies.</p><p>The co-primary efficacy endpoints were met in all phase 3 studies and show a statistically significant higher efficacy (p&lt;0.0001) for both dupilumab doses compared to placebo in combination with TCS or as monotherapy. Hierarchical testing was applied to the key and other secondary endpoints at a 2sided significance level of 0.025 for the comparison between each dupilumab dose regimen and placebo.</p><p>The Co-Primary Endpoints of study R668-AD-1224 show a significant higher effect of dupilumab 300 mg QW and Q2W each in combination with TCS on the severity of AD compared to placebo + TCS. The Secondary efficacy Endpoints support the effects seen in the Co-Primary Endpoints. The difference in clinical efficacy was small between both dupilumab doses.</p><p>In the 2 replicate 16-week studies R668-AD-1334 (Solo1) and -1416 (Solo2) both dupilumab dosing regimens show superiority to placebo in the key efficacy measurements. The secondary efficacy endpoints support the effects seen in the Co-Primary Endpoints and show a significant reduction in the Weekly Average of Peak Daily Pruritus NRS at several timepoints. Additionally the high amount of other efficacy endpoints that were assessed support the favourable efficacy of dupilumab compared to placebo.</p><p>The data from the identical 2 pivotal phase 3 studies were pooled in Efficacy Pool1. The analyses show the superiority of both dupilumab doses to placebo with respect to the co-primary and key secondary endpoints.</p><p>Additionally pooled subgroup analyses were performed on the integrated efficacy dataset of Efficacy Pool 1. Of special interest is the Ciclosporin subgroup analysis. 3 subsets of patients for whom treatment with oral Ciclosporin was medically inadvisable show that both dupilumab dose regimens resulted in clinically meaningful improvements in signs and symptoms of AD across all 3 patient subsets in Efficacy Pool 1, with similar findings observed in R668-AD-1224.</p><p>The trials were not powered to detect differences between the active arms however no difference in efficacy can be seen between dupilumab given Q2W or QW which is similar to the monotherapy trials.</p><p>It can also be seen in the week 16 data that the IGA response is slightly higher with the combination of Assessment report EMA/512262/2017 Page 68/100 dupilumab+ TCS VS dupilumab alone, however the placebo response is higher in study AD 1224 as patients were on TCS, but the differences from placebo are similar, therefore the effects are additive only.</p><p>For both dose regimens in the three studies, the difference in the proportion of patients who met the endpoint EASI 75 at week 16 compared to placebo was clinically meaningful and statistically significant (P&lt;0.0001). The differences in the proportion of patients who met the endpoint compared to placebo and the associated 95% CIs suggested there was no meaningful difference in the response rate of the 300 mg QW regimen over the 300 mg Q2W regimen in either study.</p><p>Supportive analysis using data from the PPS yielded comparable results to the FAS for both studies and supported the same conclusions as those generated from the FAS. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results of the primary efficacy endpoint were not driven by the method of handling missing data. In both studies, the results of all pre-specified sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analysis.</p><p>Inclusion of other secondary efficacy endpoints allowed an assessment of different perspectives of the treatment response. Analysis of these endpoints at week 16 showed that dupilumab monotherapy and with TCS resulted in statistically significantly larger reductions from baseline in EASI, SCORAD, BSA involvement with AD, and GISS cumulative score compared to placebo. These findings provide further evidence for improvements in both objective and subjective assessments of AD in dupilumab-treated patients.</p><p>Further, dupilumab monotherapy or in combination with TCS resulted in statistically significantly greater reductions from baseline compared to placebo for POEM, DLQI and HADS, indicating improvements in patient-reported symptoms, HRQL, and symptoms of anxiety and depression.</p><p>Dupilumab demonstrated a consistent effect for the co primary endpoints on the proportion of patients who achieved both IGA 0 or 1 and a reduction from baseline of ≥ 2 points at week 16 across all subgroups assessed and for EASI 75 response including age, weight, race, baseline disease severity, and previous use of systemic medications for AD, as shown by treatment-by-subgroup interaction testing.</p><p>Longer term efficacy was examined in study R688-AD-1224. Statistically significant results are seen in IGA response 0 or 1 with continued treatment at 52 weeks in patients who achieved an IGA 0 or 1 at 16 weeks in both regimens. The proportion of patients with EASI-75 at week 52 was significantly higher in both dupilumab groups. The primary endpoint EASI 75 at week 16 was statistically significantly higher in the treated patients versus placebo. The many secondary endpoints which included IGA 0-1 response, PRURITIS, SCORAD, POEM and DLQI were statistically significantly better with dupilumab therapy. Onset of action was rapid, with divergence between dupilumab + TCS and placebo + TCS apparent as early as week 2 for many endpoints. The study was adequately powered for the primary analysis.</p><p>Multiple sensitivity analyses using all observed data confirmed the results of the primary analysis, demonstrating that these outcomes were not driven by the analytic method of categorizing patients who used rescue treatment as non-responders, even though rescue was more common in the placebo Of note, the commercial formulation was introduced in June 2016.This study was ongoing between 28</p><p>Jan 2016 and 28 Dec 2016. Of the 325 patients enrolled in the study, 48 patients received the previous clinical formulation only and 27 patients received the commercial formulation only.</p><p>The duration of the study was rather short as the endpoints measured efficacy at 16 weeks however the trial adds additional support for use in patients with AD who cannot tolerate or do not respond to CsA therapy and confirms results from the CAFÉ -like population subset in the CHRONOS study (R668-AD-1224) that demonstrated efficacy in this patient population at both Weeks 16 and 52.</p><p>In study R668-AD-1415 (SOLO-CONTINUE), a study conducted in a subset of patients who achieved high-level clinical response (IGA(0,1) or EASI-75) after 16-week treatment in one of the initialtreatment (parent) studies (SOLO 1 R668-AD-1334 and SOLO 2 R668-AD-1416), patients who continued on the same dose regimen received in the SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 studies (300 mg Q2W or 300 mg QW) showed the optimal effect in maintaining clinical response while efficacy for other dose regimens diminished in a dose-dependent manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.4.">Conclusions on the clinical efficacy</head><p>The superiority to placebo was demonstrated for both dupilumab doses as monotherapy or in combination with TCS in AD patients who are insufficiently controlled with topical therapies alone. No significant additional benefit was observed with weekly dosing versus Q2W dosing (300 mg s.c) in the overall population. Therefore, the CHMP endorsed the proposed dose of 300 mg every other week (Q2W) with a loading dose of 600 mg on day 1.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient exposure</head><p>Safety data from 17 studies (data cut-off date of 31 May 2016) was evaluated in this submission. 2526 AD patients were exposed to dupilumab in 11 studies (10 placebo-controlled studies and 1 OLE study, excluding healthy volunteers) with a treatment period of ≥4 weeks. The duration of exposure for adult patients with AD who have been treated with dupilumab is as follows:</p><p>• at least 1 year (364 days) for 739 patients (total duration any dupilumab dose): 645 patients with 300 mg weekly (QW) and 58 patients with 300 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) • at least 1.5 years (546 days) for 309 patients (total duration any dupilumab dose): 91 patients with 300 mg QW • at least 2 years (728 days) for 160 patients (total duration any dupilumab dose)</p><p>The safety data from these studies have been integrated into 3 pools, the Primary Safety Pool, the Approximately 69% of patients experienced a TEAE. The proportion of patients who experienced a TEAE during the 16-week treatment period was similar between the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W and 300 mg QW groups and the placebo group. The proportion of patients with treatment-emergent SAEs was lower in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W and 300 mg QW groups than in the placebo group (2.5% and 2.1% versus 5.0%).</p><p>The proportion of patients with severe TEAEs was lower in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W and 300 mg QW groups than in the placebo group (3.8% and 4.1% versus 8.3%). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R668-AD-1224 (Dupilumab plus Concomitant TCS): 16-Week Data</head><p>For the purpose of comparison with 16-week monotherapy data, 16-week treatment data from the long-term study R668-AD-1224 (dupilumab+ TCS) were evaluated. Overall, the TEAE results during the first 16 weeks of treatment in the R668-AD-1224 study were consistent with those observed for the 16-week treatment period in the Primary Safety Pool. The proportion of patients who had treatment-emergent SAEs was similar among the Q2W+TCS (0.9%) and dupilumab 300 mg QW+TCS (2.5%) groups. A higher proportion of patients in the placebo + TCS group had TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug (4.8%) than the dupilumab 300 mg.</p><p>The trend in TEAEs were generally the same as observed for the monotherapy Primary Safety Pool, with the notable exception of a higher incidence of Conjunctivitis Allergic across all treatment groups, including placebo, compared to the incidence in the monotherapy population. There was also a lower incidence of Dermatitis Atopic across all treatment groups compared to the incidence in the monotherapy Primary Safety Pool.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R668-AD-1224 (Dupilumab plus Concomitant TCS): 52-Week Data</head><p>The TEAE results for the 52-week treatment period were generally similar to the results observed for the 16-week treatment period except for a higher crude (unadjusted) incidence of AEs. The overall pattern of TEAEs during the 52-week treatment period in the R668-AD-1224 study was consistent with that observed for the first 16-weeks of treatment. A higher proportion of patients in the placebo + TCS group had treatment-emergent SAEs (5.1%) compared to the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS (3.6%) Assessment report EMA/512262/2017 Page 72/100 and dupilumab 300 mg QW + TCS (2.9%) groups, and TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug (7.6%) compared to the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS (1.8%) and dupilumab 300 mg QW + TCS (2.9%) groups.</p><p>There was no clear evidence of an overall dose dependent increase in TEAEs across the Dupilumab 300mg Q2W and QW doses except for injection site reaction (ISR). This was apparent across all analyses. At week 52 there was a trend toward a higher incidence of TEAE in the Q2W treated group for TEAEs herpes simplex, blepharitis and dry eye. In the QW dose group oral herpes conjunctivitis bacterial, conjunctivitis allergic, blepharitis and injection site reaction occurred more commonly compared with the QW2 regime.</p></div>

The majority of cases were mild to moderate in severity.</p><p>In the Infections and infestation SOC the percentage of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE was similar across all treatment groups (dupilumab 300mg Q2W 33% dupilumab QW 34%: placebo 31%). Within the SOC there was some difference in reporting rates noted. There were higher rates of sinusitis, oral herpes, conjunctivitis bacterial, herpes simplex, URTI and nasopharyngitis in the dupilumab group compared with placebo. There was higher incidence of conjunctivitis and herpes simplex, oral herpes cases in the dupilumab treated groups in both the primary safety pool and the supportive safety pool. Folliculitis, impetigo and skin infections occurred more frequently in the placebo group. The majority of these events were mild to moderate in severity, resolved during the treatment period and did not lead to study medication discontinuation.</p><p>In the eye disorders SOC there was an increased incidence of allergic conjunctivitis, blepharitis and dry eye in both the primary safety pool and the supportive safety pool. This was against a high background history of eye disorders (23% patients had a history of allergic conjunctivitis). The majority were mild to moderate in severity and resolved with treatment. However, 20% of cases had not resolved during the study period. There were no serious cases.</p><p>Immunogenicity assay results were reported as ADA positive or negative. Positive immunoreactivity results in the ADA assay were summarized according to the current ADA definitions as pre-existing, treatment-boosted, or treatment-emergent. Treatment-emergent responses were further characterized as persistent, indeterminate, or transient. In the phase 3 studies, samples that were positive in the ADA assay were further characterized for neutralizing activity.</p><p>In all the studies of dupilumab in AD patients, which included studies conducted in patients treated with dupilumab for over 52 weeks, the proportion of patients with treatment-emergent positive response in the ADA assay was approximately 7%.</p><p>Immunogenicity of dupilumab generally varied inversely with dupilumab dose regimen, with the incidence of treatment-emergent ADA-positive response observed to decrease with greater dupilumab doses in all studies. Most patients who had a positive response in the ADA assay had titers that were low (&lt;1000). Some patients exhibited moderate titers (≥1,000 to ≤10,000), and only a few patients had high titer (&gt;10,000). Of those patients with treatment-emergent positive response in the ADA assay, only a small proportion of patients were found to have a persistent ADA-positive response (&lt;1% of all dupilumab-treated patients sampled in the Primary Safety Pool). Even among patients treated with dupilumab over a 52-week period, persistent treatment-emergent ADA-positive response was observed in &lt;2% of patients.</p><p>As the overall number of patients who experienced a treatment-emergent or treatment-boosted assay response was small, no clear conclusions can be drawn regarding the clinical relevance of any differences in the incidence of TEAEs between ADA-positive and ADA-negative patients.</p><p>There were 2 patients with high ADA titer, one of whom had a Serum Sickness-Like Reaction and the other had Serum Sickness.</p></div>

In the Infections and Infestations SOC, the proportion of patients with a treatment-emergent SAE was 0.2% in the dupilumab Q2W treated group, 0.8% in the dupilumab QW group and was 1% in the placebo group. There were no discernible trends at the SOC and PT levels for the remaining SAEs in the dupilumab treated populations. Three cases of myocardial infarction (two reported as acute) were reported in the dupilumab treatment groups in the monotherapy studies. The proportion of patients discontinuing from their study due to SAEs was slightly lower in the dupilumab group compared to placebo (dupilumab 300mg Q2W 0.8% dupilumab QW 0.4%: placebo 1.4%.</p><p>In the long term combination study, the results for the SAEs for the first 16-weeks and 52 of treatment were generally similar to the results observed for the Primary Safety Pool.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Laboratory findings</head><p>The dupilumab groups, both as monotherapy and with concomitant TCS, showed a trend toward modestly greater mean decrease from baseline in platelets and neutrophils than did the placebo group from baseline to week 16 with a similar trend extending through week 52. The changes in these 2 hematology parameters appeared to be due to patients with high values at baseline decreasing to normal, observed with dupilumab but not with placebo treatment. Of note, a proportion of patients had high baseline values in platelet and neutrophil counts and many of these patients shifted to normal values by the end of the treatment period. The incidences of Thrombocytopenia and Platelet Count Decreased TEAEs were low overall and there did not appear to be any clinical consequence of this modest decrease in platelet count. The modest decrease in neutrophil count was not associated with an increased incidence of Infections and Infestations.</p><p>The dupilumab monotherapy groups had a transient increase from baseline in eosinophils, and the mean increase from baseline was modestly greater in the dupilumab groups than in the placebo group at all post-baseline assessments to week 16 with a similar trend extending through week 52. A high proportion of patients had high eosinophil levels at baseline, with more patients in the placebo group shifting to normal values by the end of treatment, compared with patients in the dupilumab groups.</p><p>Lactate dehydrogenase levels clearly showed a progressive and greater decrease from baseline in the dupilumab treatment groups than in the placebo treatment group from baseline to week 16, with a similar trend extending through week 52. Consistent with this result, greater proportions of the dupilumab groups showed a shift in LDH levels from high to normal. Given the direct correlation between LDH levels with AD disease activity and severity reported from other studies, the greater decrease in LDH in the dupilumab group, compared with the placebo group, may be related to the greater efficacy of dupilumab in decreasing AD severity. The eDISH analyses found no evidence of drug-induced liver toxicity in any patient.</p></div>

Safety data from the 2 completed studies in asthma, 1 ongoing open-label extension study in asthma as of the data cutoff of 31 January 2016, and the completed study in nasal polyposis revealed no new safety signal that is different from the AD program. It is noted that the higher incidence of conjunctivitis and Oral</p><p>Herpes with dupilumab treatment in the AD program was not observed in data from the asthma and nasal polyposis programs.

In the R668-AD-1224 study, at week 16 dupilumab+TCS treated patients who were intolerant of ciclosporin had a higher incidence of TEAEs in the Eye Disorders SOC, which consisted largely of Conjunctivitis Allergic and Blepharitis. The incidence was also higher in the combined dupilumab + TCS group than in the placebo + TCS group for both the Conjunctivitis Allergic and Blepharitis PTs over the 52-week duration of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)</head><p>AESIs were prospectively identified in the dupilumab clinical program except for the AESI of Conjunctivitis, which was identified following the analysis of the SOLO studies. The prospectively identified AESIs were considered based on the pharmacologic properties of dupilumab and its mechanism of action, conditions associated with or diagnosed in patients with AD, or the fact that dupilumab is a protein biologic that is administered SC.</p><p>The following is a list of all the events included and analyzed as AESIs:</p><p>• The proportion of patients with at least 1 AESI or serious AESI, and the profile of AESIs and serious</p><p>AESIs during the entire study period was similar to that observed for the 16-week treatment period and for the follow-up period.</p><p>The exposure-adjusted patient and event incidence of AESIs showed similar trends as the crude patient incidence of AESIs. The mean time to first occurrence of any AESI during the 16-week treatment period was similar between all treatment groups (range: 104.6 [±25.57] days in placebo group to 108.5 [±19.34] days in the 300 mg Q2W group. The HRs with 95% CI were 0.577 (0.282 -1.180) in dupilumab 300 mg Q2W and 0.246 (0.092 -0.655) in the 300 mg QW groups.</p><p>The cumulative incidence of any AESI during the 16-week treatment period was lower over time in the dupilumab treatment groups compared to the placebo group.</p><p>Of the patients who reported any event of this conjunctivitis category, only 1 patient in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group discontinued study treatment due to the event. Of the 103 conjunctivitis TEAEs reported during the treatment period in dupilumab-treated patients in the Primary Safety Pool, 78.6% of the events resolved or were resolving during the treatment period. </p></div>

The proportion of patients who had at least 1 AESI during the 52-week treatment period was lower for patients in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS group (3.6%) and 300 mg QW + TCS group (2.5%) than the placebo + TCS group (7.0%). The trends in the individual AESIs were generally the same as observed for the first 16-week of treatment. There were no new safety signals for AESIs detected with LTT during the 52-week treatment period. </p></div>

A similar picture was seen in the supportive safety pool and the long-term safety data from the combination dupilumab +TCS study. A higher proportion of patients in the dupilumab Q2W group than the dupilumab QW group reported these reactions. Average time to onset was between 107-110 days across the treatment groups. Most events of Acute Allergic Reactions requiring treatment had clear precipitating agents responsible for the reactions. In the long term combination study at week 52 acute allergic reaction requiring treatment were reported in 0.3% (1/315) for placebo + TCS, and 0% for both dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS and 300 mg Q2W + TCS.</p><p>A review of events of urticaria from the Safety Pools, as well as the R668-AD-1224 LTT and R668-AD-1225 OLE studies indicated that incidence of these events was not increased with dupilumab treatment. No cases of anaphylactic reactions were identified in the primary safety pool or the LTT safety study (dupilumab +TCS). There was one case in the supportive safety pool and 3 cases in the OLE all attributable to food allergies. In the OLE study there was one case of systemic allergic reaction following four doses of study treatment that resulted in study drug discontinuation.</p><p>There was no indication that dupilumab treatment increased the overall occurrence of acute allergic reactions requiring treatment or anaphylactic reactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mycosis Fungoides or Cutaneous T-Cell Dyscrasias</head><p>No cases of mycosis fungoides were reported in the primary safety pool. In the long-term combination study at 52 week Mycosis fungoides or other forms of cutaneous T cell lymphoma was reported for 1 patient (0.3%) on placebo + TCS, and 0 patients (0%) on either dupilumab group: 300 mg Q2W + TCS or 300 mg QW + TCS.</p><p>However overall a total of four cases of mycosis fungoides were identified across the supportive safety pool and the long term combination dupilumab +TCS study R668-AD-1224 and the OLE study. Two cases occurred during treatment with dupilumab 300mg. One case occurred in the placebo group. One case was misdiagnosed. None of the cases were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug.</p></div>

Any opportunistic infection were reported in 1% for placebo, 0.8% for dupilumab 300 mg Q2W, and 0.4% for dupilumab 300 mg QW treated patients. Infection requiring treatment with parenteral antibiotic was reported for 0.7% for placebo, 1% for dupilumab 300 mg Q2W, and 1.9% for dupilumab 300 mg QW groups. No infection requiring treatment with oral antibiotic/anti-viral/anti-fungal for longer than 2 weeks or cases of clinical endoparasitosis was reported for this safety population.</p><p>In the long term combination therapy study at 52 weeks, infection requiring treatment with parenteral antibiotic were reported for 1.0% for placebo + TCS, 0.9% for dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS, and In the R668-AD-1225 OLE study, the incidence of opportunistic infections was 1.7% , 0.4% for patients requiring i.v antibiotics, 0.9% for severe infection and 1% for infection requiring oral treatment &gt;2 weeks</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Injection Site Reactions</head><p>No TEAEs met the criteria for this AESI category (Severe ISR lasting longer than 24 hours in the Primary Safety Pool or the Supportive Safety Pool or the R668-AD-1224 LTT study). In the R668-AD-1225 OLE study, 1 patient developed a severe ISR. The events were assessed as a non-serious AESI and TEAE leading to study drug discontinuation. The events were considered to be related to the study drug and improved or stopped after stopping the study drug.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Suicidal Behaviour</head><p>In Conjunctivitis and eye disorders (dry eye, eye pruritus, and blepharitis) were observed more commonly in the dupilumab groups than the placebo group in all safety pools and long term combination and open label studies. Most cases were mild to moderate in severity and resolved with local treatment. (approx. 80% in the monotherapy studies and 90% in the combination therapy studies). However 10-20% did not resolve. Two patients discontinued study treatment due to conjunctivitis across all studies. Although a number of these events were classified as infectious in origin, microbiological confirmation was not conducted. A significant proportion of patients who developed these events had a background history of conjunctivitis, longer history of AD and higher baseline disease activity. Increased report of eye disorders was not seen in the phase 2b study for dupilumab in asthma.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R668-AD-1415</head><p>Dupilumab was well tolerated in this study. The majority of patients reported TEAEs that were mild to moderate in intensity. The incidence of severe TEAEs was less than 6% in any treatment group and was similar across the treatment groups. One death occurred in the dupilumab 300 mg Q4W group as a result of Gun Shot Wound (a homicide event). Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported by &lt;5% of patients across all treatment groups. No dose-response trend was observed. There was no anaphylaxis or other systemic hypersensitivity reactions to dupilumab. There appeared to be a reverse doseresponse trend in the incidence of TEAEs leading to temporary discontinuation of the study treatment, with the highest incidence in the placebo group (12.2%) and the lowest in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W/QW group (3.6%). An inverse dose-response trend was observed in the incidence of overall TEAEs, which was largely driven by exacerbation of AD and skin infections. There was no apparent safety advantage for the lower dupilumab dose regimens (300 mg Q4W and Q8W). The incidences of conjunctivitis and herpes viral infections were similar between placebo and dupilumab regimen groups.</p><p>The incidence of skin infections in placebo was higher than dupilumab regimen groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R668-AD-1424</head><p>Both dose regimens of dupilumab were well tolerated in this study with an acceptable safety profile, which is endorsed</p><p>The major difference between the safety profile for the monotherapy treatment and the combination therapy safety profiles at both 16 and 52 weeks is an increase in the eye disorder reports. A higher incidence of eye-disorders (conjunctivitis, blepharitis and dry eye), was seen in dupilumab treated patients compared to placebo in both the monotherapy and combination therapy studies. Patients who developed eye disorders were older, had longer duration of AD, had higher disease activity at baseline, had a baseline history of eye disorders and were more likely to have been treated previously with immunosuppressants. Although the majority of cases were mild to moderate in severity and responded to treatment with topical preparations a significant proportion (10-20%) hadn't resolved. The longterm effect of this chronic conjunctivitis is unknown. The aetiology of these cases has not been adequately determined. Higher frequency of treatment emergent conjunctivitis in dupilumab-treated patients than placebo-treated patients was observed in AD studies, but not in asthma or NP studies, suggesting that moderate-severe AD may be a risk factor for this event. As outlined by the applicant, there are clear gaps in the knowledge related to conjunctivitis related events. Inclusion of Conjunctivitis related events as missing information is supported. Until further information is available, patients treated with dupilumab who develop conjunctivitis should undergo ophthalmological examination and appropriate warning has been included in SmPC section 4.4.</p><p>Basically, no relevant changes were detected between the placebo and dupilumab groups in hematology, chemistry, and urinary analysis parameters apart from eosinophil and LDH levels.</p><p>Circulating eosinophils were transiently increased in the dupilumab treatment groups without any difference as to the dosing scheme. The increase was moderate and returned to baseline after week 16. Based on the data provided, the Applicant identified this TEAE as an ADR and this is fully endorsed.</p><p>Currently there is only a limited amount of safety data for elderly patients and the Applicant has stated that the number of elderly patients enrolled in the AD studies was too small to make meaningful comparisons with the general adult population data. This might be caused by the fact that incidence and prevalence of AD declines in the course of lifetime. Therefore, 'Safety in patients aged 65 years and above' has been included in the RMP as 'Missing information'.</p><p>The spontaneous abortion rate registered during the dupilumab studies does not seem to exceed the general rate (26% vs. ~30%). However, dedicated studies analysing the effect of dupilumab on pregnancies and their outcomes are hitherto missing. So far, no adverse effects on pregnancy or on the baby could be determined. The same applies to breastfeeding.</p><p>Opportunistic infections were rare in general and patients of the dupilumab treatment groups showed lower incidences than the placebo groups apart from local HSV infections which seem as in general linked to AD and not to be caused by the dupilumab treatment. Results of the CHRONOS and OLE Assessment report EMA/512262/2017 Page 88/100 study were consistent. After due analysis, it appears that allergic reactions are infrequent, mostly mild to moderate and manageable by supportive care apart from Injection site reactions which were listed as ADR.</p><p>The number of subjects experiencing AEs leading to withdrawal in both the placebo-controlled and OLE studies was low. Especially in the LTT study CHRONOS the treatment discontinuation was lower than in the placebo groups.</p><p>No clinically significant differences in the AE-or SAE-profiles or -rates were observed in dupilumab patients for whom ciclosporin treatment is inadvisable. This analysis included patients form the pivotal and long term studies who didn't respond to ciclosporin, who could not tolerate ciclosporin or for whom post ciclosporin was medically inadvisable.</p><p>The incidence and pattern of TEAEs was broadly comparable between patients for whom ciclosporin was medically inadvisable and patient who were not included in this subset. Of note there were higher rates of exacerbation of atopic dermatitis, including cases that were severe and requiring discontinuation of study drug and higher rates of allergic conjunctivitis and blepharitis that increased over the duration of the 52 week study in the population for whom ciclosporin was medically inadvisable. The safety profile treatment with a dupilumab dose regimen of 300 mg Q2W or 300 mg QW is broadly similar. For AD patients with a history of inadequate response to topical therapies for whom CSA treatment is medically inadvisable, there is a high unmet medical need. In this patient population, the safety profile following treatment with a dupilumab dose regimen of 300 mg Q2W or 300 mg QW, was broadly similar to the subset 3 analysis (subgroup of AD patients not adequately controlled with, intolerant of oral ciclosporin, or for whom oral ciclosporin was not medically advisable in the pooled pivotal studies and the dupilumab +TCS long term study). Considering these patients are the most severe treatment resistant subgroup these data suggest that dupilumab is well tolerated.</p><p>Overall rates of ADA in the monotherapy studies and combination therapy studies were low and appear to be transient. In general titre levels were low. Of note, two cases (1 each of serum sickness type reaction/serum sickness) were reported for 2 dupilumab treated patients with high antibody titres.</p><p>The onset of reaction in both cases was approximately around 2 weeks of starting study treatment.</p><p>Currently Dupilumab is contraindicated in patients who have a known hypersensitivity to it, or to any of its excipients. Section 4.4 with cross reference to 4.8 warns that dupilumab should be discontinued immediately if a patient develops a systemic hypersensitivity reaction. The warnings regarding serum sickness were additionally revised to state that these reactions occurred within the first few weeks of treatment with dupilumab. Further data on the incidence of ADAs and their relation to safety from follow-up studies lasting over 1 year should be provided for review when available.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">Available therapies and unmet medical need</head><p>Among the main goals in treating AD are the reduction of skin inflammation and the alleviation of symptoms, particularly pruritus.</p><p>Atopic dermatitis is treated primarily with topical corticosteroids (TCS). However, continuous long-term application of TCS, particularly TCS products with higher potency, is not recommended, because of the risk of skin atrophy, dyspigmentation, acneiform eruptions and risks associated with systemic absorption and subsequent HPA axis suppression. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, are generally safe and effective as continuous short-term treatments or intermittent long-term treatment. Concerns over the potential increased risk of skin malignancies and lymphomas associated with TCI use has prompted regulatory authorities to require, in their prescribing information, a warning regarding long-term safety. Treatment guidelines currently recommend TCI as second-line therapy and typically restrict TCI to "problem areas" that cannot be treated with TCS (eg, face, genital, intertriginous areas, or areas of skin atrophy).</p><p>The majority of patients with mild AD respond well to topical therapy. However, patients with moderate-to-severe AD often do not achieve adequate control with acceptable doses of topical medications and frequently require systemic therapy.</p><p>Systemic therapy is indicated in patients who do not respond adequately to topical therapies or for whom topical therapy is inadvisable. Currently available systemic therapies include nonselective immunosuppressants such as systemic corticosteroids, which are associated with severe toxicity and side effects (eg, glaucoma, edema, weight gain, increased blood pressure, and mood swings with short term use; cataracts, increased blood sugar, osteoporosis, thinning of the skin, increased risk of infections, and effects on growth in children with long term use). Because of these safety drawbacks, most guidelines recommend systemic corticosteroids only for short term treatment of AD. Patients' AD often rebounds once treatment is stopped, particularly after discontinuing systemic glucocorticoids.</p><p>Other nonselective immunosuppressive drugs are being used in AD, off-label, with variable results.</p><p>These drugs have well established toxicity profiles (eg, myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity for methotrexate, leucopenia for azathioprine, etc.) that make it difficult for use in managing a chronic, life-long disease such as AD. In addition, the broad immunosuppressive effects of these drugs are associated with an increased risk of developing serious bacterial, fungal, viral, and mycobacterial infections.</p><p>Ciclosporin A, a potent, oral, non-selective immunosuppressant originally developed for prevention of organ transplant rejection, is currently approved in many countries of the EU to treat severe AD, particularly AD that is refractory to topical treatment. The use of Ciclosporin A in AD is limited by commonly recognized toxicities, including hypertension, impaired renal and hepatic function, and the potential for greater susceptibility to infections and cancer, particularly to skin cancer. The use of ciclosporin A requires intensive safety monitoring, especially of renal and liver function. Because of the high toxicity of ciclosporin A, its approved use in AD is limited to treatment of only severe cases, with a maximum duration of 1 year. Other limitations of ciclosporin A treatment include its interactions with other commonly used medicines, which can potentially affect their metabolism and efficacy.</p><p>Thus, there exists a significant unmet medical need for an alternative treatment for moderate-tosevere AD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3.">Main clinical studies</head><p>This application was supported by data from 13 studies in adult patients with AD, ranging from phase 1b to phase 3, with the clinical efficacy almost entirely based on the results of the pivotal phase 3 Assessment report EMA/512262/2017 Page 94/100 studies. The majority of the studies evaluated dupilumab as a monotherapy in adult patients who were candidates for systemic therapy.</p><p>In the pivotal phase 3 studies standard efficacy variables for AD were used as key endpoints to assess efficacy of dupilumab. Efficacy assessments included direct measurements of the extent and severity of AD signs and symptoms, the impact of AD disease symptoms on quality of life, and anxiety and depression scores. Physician and patients reported efficacy evaluations were used (e.g. EASI-75, IGA 0 or1, Pruritus NRS, DLQI, HADS) at different timepoints during the studies.</p><p>The phase 3 studies and the treatment groups in the phase 2b study that were studied in phase 3 (placebo, 300 mg weekly [QW], and 300 mg every 2 weeks [Q2W]) have been pooled to provide a more comprehensive and precise assessment of the safety of dupilumab as monotherapy. Two phase 3 studies provide information on dupilumab when administered concomitantly with topical medications (TCS with or without TCI, as applicable; referred to as + TCS in the summary), since TCS represent the mainstay of pharmacological treatment for AD and many patients may ultimately use dupilumab with concomitant topical treatments. These are the long-term treatment study R668-AD-1224 (LTT), which provides placebo-controlled safety information on dupilumab when administered as concomitant treatment with TCS, and the open-label extension study R668-AD-1225 (OLE) where patients had the option of using dupilumab concomitantly with topical treatments. These 2 studies also provide information on long-term safety. Study R668-AD-1224 provides 52-week randomized control data on the use of dupilumab + TCS versus placebo + TCS. The OLE study includes patients from phase 2 and phase 3 studies and allows evaluation of the safety of continued LTT as well as re-treatment with dupilumab after treatment discontinuation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Favourable effects</head><p>Over 2000 patients were enrolled in the pivotal phase 3 studies. The analyses of the key efficacy results of all studies show a significant higher reduction in severity and symptoms of atopic dermatitis compared to placebo. Standard efficacy variables for AD were used to assess efficacy of dupilumab i.e.</p><p>IGA 0 or1 with ≥2 points reduction and EASI-75 as co-primary and Pruritus NRS at different time points as key secondary endpoints.</p><p>In study R668-AD-1224 the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS group 68.9% of the patients achieved EASI-75 at week 16, followed by the dupilumab 300 mg QW + TCS group with 63.9% and 23.2% of the patients on placebo + TCS. The results of the other co-primary endpoint show that 38.7% in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS, 39.2% dupilumab 300 mg QW + TCS and 12.4% placebo + TCS group achieved an IGA 0 or 1 and a reduction from baseline of ≥ 2 points at week.

The comparisons were statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001 for each).</p><p>The applicant submitted the results from the supplementary studies R668-AD-1424 and R668-AD-1415 in specific subsets, demonstrating clinically relevant efficacy and safety information of both dupilumab doses. R668-AD-1424 was conducted in patients with severe atopic dermatitis for whom CSA had either not demonstrated adequate efficacy, had unacceptable side effects or for whom initiating CSA was not medically advisable. They represent a population that is difficult to treat and for which there is an unmet medical need as there are limited treatment options. Efficacy has been demonstrated on the EASI-75 response at 16 weeks and for all of the key secondary objective and symptomatic endpoints.</p><p>Study R668-AD-1415 enrolled patients who had completed 16 weeks of mono-therapy. In this study, patients who continued on the same dose regimen received in the parent AD-1334 and AD-1416 studies (300 mg Q2W or 300 mg QW), showed the optimal effect in maintaining clinical response while efficacy for other dose regimens diminished in a dose-dependent manner.

In the earlier Scientific Advice the CHMP recommended the use of an approved systemic treatment (Ciclosporin) for AD.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Unfavourable effects</head><p>A higher incidence of Conjunctivitis was observed in the dupilumab groups compared to the placebo group in both the Primary and Supportive Safety Pools. Patients who developed eye disorders were older, had longer duration of AD, had higher disease activity at baseline, had a baseline history of eye disorders and were more likely to have been treated previously with immunosuppressants.</p><p>Conjunctivitis has therefore been listed as ADRs as well as Conjunctivitis Allergic, Blepharitis, and Dry Eye, based on the association with dupilumab treatment. The majority of cases were mild to moderate in severity and were self-limiting. However, approximately 10-20% had not resolved by the end of the study. The long term effect of chronic conjunctivitis in these patients is unknown. The aetiology of these cases has not been adequately determined. Conjunctivitis related events have there been included as missing information in the RMP which is endorsed.</p><p>The incidence of Oral Herpes during the treatment periods in the Primary and Supportive Safety Pools was higher in the dupilumab groups compared to the placebo group. However, the long term data show an only slightly higher rate of oral herpes in the dupilumab Q2W group compared to placebo.</p><p>The frequency of Eosinophilia during the 16-week treatment period in the Primary Safety Pool was higher in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group (1.7%), and similar between the 300 mg QW group (0.2%) and placebo group (0.4%). However, Eosinophilia was reported at a similar incidence in the dupilumab group (1.0%) and in the placebo group (0.7%) in the Supportive Safety Pool. Evaluation of laboratory data indicates that a Transient Eosinophilia was seen with dupilumab treatment in a minority of patients. Although the precise mechanism is unknown, Eosinophilia is considered as an ADR.</p><p>Dupilumab use was associated with ISRs at a higher incidence than placebo in both the Primary and Supportive Safety Pools. There were no events of severe ISRs in both Pools. Based on the association with dupilumab use, ISRs are considered an ADR.</p><p>The incidence of Acute Allergic Reactions was similar across all treatment groups in the Primary Assessment report EMA/512262/2017 Page 96/100 Safety Pool and different dose groups, respectively. Most of these reactions were skin-related. There was a serious event of Serum sickness-Like Illness described in a patient treated with dupilumab in the Supportive Safety Pool and one serious event of serum sickness in study R668-AD-1225. Both these events were associated with high titers ADA There was one non-serious serum sickness case observed in study R668-AD-1424. There were 3 events of Anaphylaxis in the R668-AD-1225 OLE study and none were assessed as related to dupilumab treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects</head><p>Long-term safety experience is limited. Based on the currently available data, on review of adverse events of special interest, there was no apparent increased risk of malignancy, infections, or serious cardiac, vascular, thromboembolic and ischaemic events. The overall risk of systemic allergic and nonallergic reactions with dupilumab and the immunogenic potential of dupilumab appear low. However, this will be further explored and confirmed in the ongoing open-label extension trial to further characterise the long-term safety of treatment.</p><p>Currently there is only a limited amount of safety data for special populations as pregnant and lactating women, children and patients with organ impairment. Further data will be collected in the post-marketing setting.</p><p>Animal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity.

The majority of patients with mild AD respond well to topical therapy. However, patients with moderate-to-severe AD often do not achieve adequate control with acceptable doses of topical medications and frequently require systemic therapy. Systemic therapy is indicated in patients who do not respond adequately to topical therapies or for whom topical therapy is inadvisable.</p><p>Currently available systemic therapies include nonselective immunosuppressants such as systemic corticosteroids, which are associated with severe toxicity and side effects.</p><p>The overall safety profile of dupilumab is mainly characterised by minor adverse reactions (upper respiratory tract infections, conjunctivitis and local injection site reactions which were in general mild, self-limiting and manageable). Its immunogenicity and allergic potential is low. In addition, the burden of biweekly subcutaneous injections is likely to be considered low by the patient against the background that no systemic and efficacious therapy is in place to date. The safety profile of the both dose regimens did not significantly differ. Further long-term data will be collected to substantiate the safety profile which hitherto seems to be acceptable.</p></div>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_44"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Because dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody, it is not anticipated to directly interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes, other drug metabolizing enzymes, or drug transporters; thus, no typical drug-drug interactions via these mechanisms is expected. However, limited in vitro data suggest that IL-4 and IL-13 affect the expression (and potentially the activities) of some cytochrome P450 isoforms. Therefore, it is possible that dupilumab, by inhibiting IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, may indirectly influence the expression of these cytochrome P450 isoforms. Consequently, an open-label, drug-drug interaction study (R668-AD-1433) was designed to examine the effects of dupilumab on the PK of selected cytochrome P450 substrates in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD. This study was completed and did not indicate clinically relevant effects of dupilumab on CYP1A2, CYP3A, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP2C9 activity.During the dupilumab development program, investigators were advised to monitor patients who used concomitant drugs with narrow therapeutic indexes and that were metabolized by cytochrome enzymes.

No new safety signals related to identified, and no dose-dependent trends were observed.There were no deaths. A similar proportion of patients in the placebo + TCS group (1.9%) and in the dupilumab + TCS groups had SAEs (1.9% in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS group and 1.8% in the dupilumab 300 mg QW + TCS group). No SAEs were considered related to dupilumab treatment. The proportion of patients with TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug was generally low and comparable across treatment groups. A lower proportion of patients in the in the combined dupilumab + TCS treatment group (3.7%) had severe TEAEs compared to patients in the placebo + TCS group (9.3%).The incidence of infections was 45.8% in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS group, 42.7% in the dupilumab 300 mg QW + TCS group, and 40.7% in the placebo + TCS group. The most common PTs in the SOC of Infections and Infestations were Nasopharyngitis, Conjunctivitis (of unspecified etiology) and Oral Herpes, all of which occurred with higher frequency in dupilumab-treated patients. While there was a higher incidence of localized, Muco-cutaneous Herpes Infections in dupilumab-treated patients, more serious forms of herpes infections such as Eczema Herpeticum, Ophthalmic Herpes Simplex and Ophthalmic Herpes Zoster occurred only in the placebo + TCS group. Of the localized herpes infections, none was severe and all but 1 had recovered/resolved by the end of treatment visit.Conjunctivitis events were more common in dupilumab treated patients than placebo treated patients.The majority of events had recovered/resolved by the end of treatment visit. No patients discontinued the trial due an AE of Conjunctivitis, and all but 2 patients continued into the OLE trial.From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.A total of 2825 clinical trial subjects have received at least one dose of dupilumab across a range of diseases including atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyposis with chronic sinusitis during 26 clinical studies (6 HV, 16 AD, 3 Asthma, 1 Nasal Polyposis). Overall, 1929 subjects with moderate to severe AD have received at least one dose of dupilumab and 1908 of these received dupilumab 300 mg SC, either as part of a randomized placebo-controlled or the open-label extension study. The absolute numbers and percentages of the AEs have been reported. For longer treatment periods, exposure adjusted incidence rates were calculated as well. This is important, because the exposure to dupilumab varied with time, in particular studies where patients were treated in a previous study prior to enrollment and the overall exposure to dupilumab was greater than with placebo.The size of the safety database and degree of patient exposure for dupilumab to support this application is largely considered sufficient. The numbers of patients with long term exposure to dupilumab 300mg Q2W dose, the intended dose for inclusion in the SmPC, are quite low. However, the ICH E1 safety exposure requirements of &gt;1500 patients exposed, 300 to 600 for 6 months, &gt; 100 for 1 year are well exceeded. There is one ongoing open-label extension study (1225) that will provide further data on long-term safety. The final report of this study should be submitted when available.In general, a similar frequency of patients of monotherapy placebo and verum groups showed treatment-emergent AEs with most AEs occurred in SOCs Infections and Infestations, Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders and General Disorders/Administration Site Conditions. Concerning the treatment-related TEAEs, the treatment groups had a higher frequency than the placebo group. The General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions SOC had the highest AE proportion, followed by Infections and Infestations SOC. Besides, ISR, Headache, Conjunctivitis, Eosinophilia were identified as important treatment-related TEAEs. No differences in AE pattern were seen between monotherapy and dupilumab+topical treatment (TCI/TCS). Baseline demographic characteristics were balanced apart from gender.Of the 3 cases of TESAE observed in the SSP, only the Serum Sickness-like Reaction was considered by the investigator to be caused by study drug and lead to treatment discontinuation. It was moderate in severity and fully resolved.A case of severe Serum Sickness happened during the R668-AD-1225 OLE study which was attributed to the study drug and lead to treatment discontinuation.
