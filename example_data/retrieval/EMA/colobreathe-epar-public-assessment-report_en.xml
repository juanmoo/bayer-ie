<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Introduction</head><p>Patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) have viscous mucus in the lungs that, in time, becomes colonised with various bacteria and eventually with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This leads to further lung damage and ultimately contributes to premature death, often in association with other organ damage due to the systemic nature of the disease.</p><p>The very first acquisition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurs during infancy and early childhood but this is usually intermittent and sequential cultures can be negative for variable periods of time. As age increases cultures commonly become persistently positive for this pathogen and chronic infection is established, accompanied by a transition from non-mucoid to mucoid P. aeruginosa. In the first instance Pseudomonas aeruginosa attaches within the respiratory tract using pili and other adhesins to form microcolonies. Over time there is formation of mature biofilms consisting of a community of bacteria embedded within an extracellular matrix. In these biofilm environments the bacteria communicate with each other by quorum sensing and are physiologically resistant to conventional antibacterial agents.</p><p>Antibacterial agents can be used during early infection in efforts to temporarily eradicate pathogens.</p><p>They are also used to treat pulmonary exacerbations and for chronic suppression of bacterial numbers with the aim of improving lung function in the short term and slowing the decline in lung function in the longer term. In 1981 Hodson et al. showed that a combination of inhaled carbenicillin and gentamicin in selected patients with CF led to improvement in lung function and to a reduction in hospital admissions for intravenous treatment. Similar results were obtained from other studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Wall et al., 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mukhopadhyay et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Littlewood et al., 1985)</ref>.</p><p>Antibacterial agents that are active in vitro against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (including antipseudomonal beta-lactam agents, aminoglycosides and colistimethate sodium) are administered to CF patients via the parenteral route or by inhalation. Intravenous preparations (i.e. powders made up into small volume solutions and delivered by nebulisation) are often used to provide inhaled antibacterial therapy. For example, Colomycin powder for solution for injection or inhalation is made up in 2-4 mL solution (depending on the dose) to deliver colistimethate sodium by nebulisation. A concentrated solution of tobramycin (300 mg in 5 mL) formulated specifically for use in nebulisers (TOBI) is also available.</p><p>The administration of inhaled antibacterial agents by nebuliser may take more than 15-20 minutes depending on the minimum volume of solution that is possible, the viscosity of the preparation and the model of nebuliser and compressor used. In addition, nebuliser systems generally deliver no more than about 10% of the dose to the lungs. CF patients may need to take inhaled antibacterial therapy at least twice daily together with a range of other inhaled therapies such as bronchodilators and DNAse.</p><p>The periods of time spent taking nebulised medications each day and the lack of portability of nebuliser systems (i.e. including a compressor) may have an adverse impact on quality of life.</p><p>In 1990, Goldman et al. showed that it is possible to deliver antibacterial agents by dry powder inhaler (DPI). The authors compared delivery of 160 mg gentamicin solution by nebuliser with 180 mg micronised gentamicin powder (30 mg per gelatine capsule) by Rotahaler DPI. Similar concentrations of gentamicin were found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid with the different delivery systems. Many dry powder inhalers are of a multi-dose design intended for asthma therapy and are incapable of delivering high powder doses conveniently. Crowther <ref type="bibr">Labiris et al. (1999)</ref> showed that effective quantities of Colobreathe Assessment report Page 9/66 gentamicin could be delivered by a multi-dose DPI (Clickhaler, Innovata biomed) but this required administration of 32 doses (each dose 5 mg gentamicin) over 30 minutes. In the current application a novel unit-dose DPI -Turbospin DPI -has been used to deliver 125 mg (equivalent to 1,662,500 IU) colistimethate sodium per dose from gelatine capsules.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>About the product</head><p>Polymyxins are a group of lipopeptide antibiotics isolated from the spore-forming soil bacterium Bacillus polymyxa. Five major, chemically distinct members of the group have been recognised and designated as polymyxin A, B, C, D and E. Polymyxin B and E have been in clinical use for more than 40-50 years.</p><p>Colistin is a naturally occurring multi-component polymyxin antibacterial agent produced by a selected strain of Bacillus polymyxa var colistinus. Composed mainly of polymyxin A (E1) and B (E2) it is often denoted simply as polymyxin E. It has the characteristic polymyxin structure that includes a cyclic heptapeptide joined to a tripeptide chain with a single fatty acid substituent. All the amino groups are subject to derivation. All groups are initially sulphomethylated but approximately two are hydrolysed to amino-methylol groups in aqueous solutions.</p><p>For parenteral and aerosol therapy colistin is used in the form of the sodium salt of the negativelycharged methane sulphonate derivative known as colistimethate sodium (also called colistin sulphomethate, colistin methanesulphonate or sulphopolymyxin E sulphomethate and abbreviated to CMS). Colistimethate sodium is not microbiologically active. It is hydrolysed to the active, positively charged colistin in solution and also after administration along with a complex mixture of partially sulphonated derivatives that also seem to possess variable antibacterial activity.</p><p>Colistimethate sodium is manufactured from colistin base by the action of formaldehyde and sodium bisulphite and has an approximate molecular weight of 1750.</p><p>It is very important to note that while colistimethate sodium is used for administration (including in Colobreathe, which includes the mass of 125 mg of active substance per dose) the definition of an international unit is biological and 1 IU of colistin is defined as the amount of colistin that inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli 95 I.S.M. in 1 ml broth at pH 7.2. Pure colistin base has been assigned a potency of 30,000 IU per mg, while colistimethate sodium has a potency of 12,500 IU per mg.</p><p>Polymyxins are cationic agents that are able to disrupt the hydrophobic outer membrane of susceptible aerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Colistin binds to the lipid A (endotoxin) moiety of lipopolysaccharides and to phospholipids in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. It inserts between adjacent molecules of lipopolysaccharide and displaces membrane stabilising magnesium ions. This causes the outer membrane to expand and distort so that the bacterium loses control over the influx and efflux of cations (e.g. potassium and sodium).</p><p>Disruption of the outer membrane also allows colistin molecules to penetrate through to and incorporate within the inner cytoplasmic membrane to result in increased permeability to small molecules. This increased permeability allows vital cellular constituents such as nucleic acids and proteins to leak out. </p></div>

Guideline on the pharmaceutical quality of inhalation and nasal products. Formulation development of this dry powder delivery system was conducted to produce a more convenient and effective alternative method of respiratory delivery of colistimethate sodium with the aim of delivering the equivalent respirable mass of antibiotic when compared to that delivered by the nebulised product.</p><p>In vitro formulation studies were carried out to determine the respirable mass of colistimethate sodium from a nebuliser. The capsule fill weight was therefore chosen in order to achieve a similar respirable mass based on the particulate size profile of the micronised powder. In vivo deposition study was then carried out. Data from an in vivo deposition study assessing total and regional deposition of colistimethate sodium delivered using Turbospin® powder inhaler and a nebuliser device in subjects with cystic fibrosis showed that lung deposition of colistimethate sodium was proportionately significantly higher when delivered with the Turbospin® powder inhaler than by a nebuliser. The 1,662,500 IU (125 mg) of colistimethate sodium given as a dry powder is therefore intended to deliver a dose to the lung at least equivalent to 2 million IU nebulised.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Introduction</head><p>The non-clinical dossier comprises published literature, much of which predates the establishment of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). Therefore most of the studies will not be compliant with the principles of GLP, with the exception of some of the more recent genotoxicity studies that were reportedly GLPcompliant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Pharmacology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary pharmacodynamic studies</head><p>Polymyxins are a group of lipopeptide antibiotics isolated from Bacillus polymyxa. They are selective cationic agents acting on Gram-negative bacteria by targeting the phospholipids in the bacterial cell membrane. Colistin, which is isolated from B polymyxa var. colistinus, consists of a mixture of several closely related decapeptides (polymyxin E) and has the characteristic polymyxin structure of a cyclic heptapeptide joined to a tripeptide chain with a single fatty acid substituent. The two main components are colistin A (polymyxin E1) and colistin B (polymyxin E2), which differ only in their fatty acid side chain.</p><p>Colistimethate sodium is hydrolysed to colistin, the positively charged active moiety, which has a twostep mode of action against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the bacterium targeted in the produced indication. In the first step, colistin binds to the lipopolysaccharide component of the outer membrane of sensitive Gram-negative bacteria by interaction between the peptide ring of colistin and phosphate groups present on the lipid A and core region of lipopolysaccharide. This displaces magnesium ions from phosphate groups and results in distortion of the outer membrane structure and loss of the permeability barrier. Once the permeability barrier is lost, colistin penetrates the cell wall to the underlying cytoplasmic membrane target. The disorganisation of the outer membrane also alters the cell's permeability to various hydrophobic substances including antibiotics. Insertion of colistin molecules between the phospholipid and protein components of cell membranes results in loss of membrane integrity, leakage of cytoplasmic constituents and cell death. Comparison of different forms of colistin in mice in vivo indicated that subcutaneous administration of colistimethate sodium is more effective than colistin sulphate or polymyxin B sulphate against infections with K. pneumoniae.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary pharmacodynamic studies</head><p>Receptor screening studies have not been reported in the literature. However colistin is known to have an effect on nerve conduction and can cause bronchoconstriction when nebulised.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety pharmacology programme</head><p>Conventional safety pharmacology studies have not been conducted but relevant endpoints have been reported, and a general pharmacology screen was conducted by Japanese workers in the early 1970s.</p><p>In an early series of general pharmacology studies with colistimethate sodium, a neuromuscular blocking effect was seen at lethal doses in mice. Similar effects have been reported in other species.</p><p>The neuromuscular blocking effect appears to result from inhibition of acetylcholine release from somatic nerve endings in skeletal muscle. Mutual potentiation of the muscular blocking effect between colistin and the muscle relaxant succinylcholine has been reported. The doses of colistimethate sodium causing paralysis of the respiratory muscles and death are much higher than those used clinically.</p><p>Colistimethate sodium did not have a local anaesthetic effect or mucous stimulating effect. There was no effect on intestine or uterus.</p><p>At high concentrations, solutions of colistimethate sodium depressed cardiac function measured in isolated rat atrial preparations, and induced vasodilatation in the blood vessels of isolated rabbit ear preparations. In vivo, there was no predictable effect on blood pressure or respiration in rabbits;</p><p>variable changes in blood pressure were attributed to a potential histamine liberating effect.</p><p>Intravenous colistimethate sodium (up to 6.5mg/kg) had no effect on blood pressure in dogs, but colistin sulphate at 10-fold lower doses caused a drop in blood pressure. Clinically, effects on the cardiovascular system are not common.</p><p>Colistin is mainly excreted in the urine when given parenterally. Nephrotoxicity is a potential toxic effect of colistimethate sodium in humans and is generally associated with the use of higher than recommended doses in patients with normal renal function, failure to reduce dosage in patients with renal impairment, or concomitant use with other nephrotoxic medications. There was no effect on urinary output in rabbits nor on renal function in dogs treated intravenously with colistimethate sodium at doses up to 10 mg/kg or 40mg/kg, respectively. However in another study, renal function was depressed in one of two dogs given colistimethate sodium at 2.2mg base/kg/6h (8.8mg base/kg/day).</p><p>There was also evidence of drug accumulation at this dosage. Lower doses had no effect. In other studies, repeated doses of polymyxins in rabbits and dogs showed no increase in proteinuria with polymyxin E, whereas other polymyxins produced various degrees of proteinuria in dogs.</p><p>The effects on nervous and renal systems have been well documented over the years of clinical use of colistin. Exposures expected from inhalation of colistimethate sodium are likely to be much lower than those achieved in the animal studies and therefore the risk of these known effects is minimised.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacodynamic drug interactions</head><p>The possible interactions resulting from co-administration of drugs acting on the nervous system or those with nephrotoxic effects are covered in the proposed SmPC.</p><p>Colobreathe Assessment report Page 15/66</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">Pharmacokinetics</head><p>No animal studies on the inhalation of colistimethate sodium have been identified in the literature.</p><p>When colistimethate sodium is administered to humans using a dry powder inhaler, the potential systemic exposure is either by absorption directly into the pulmonary circulation or gastrointestinal absorption following ingestion of oropharyngeal deposition and drug particulates removed from the lung by its mucociliary transport system. Therefore pharmacokinetic investigations in laboratory animals following parenteral or oral administration provide data that are relevant to inhalation exposure.</p><p>The early studies used bioassays to determine colistin levels in various matrices and were limited to measuring pharmacologically active forms of the compound. Subsequent studies have employed highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods that are more discriminatory. In many of the studies it is not clear what is being measured.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Absorption</head><p>Oral administration of colistimethate sodium or colistin sulphate to rats, rabbits, dogs, pigs and cows has resulted in little or no absorption into the systemic circulation. However, appreciable absorption from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of colistimethate sodium may occur in humans with disturbed or damaged gut mucosa; limited absorption of colistin from the GI tract has been reported in newborn animals and in children less than six months of age, in which the gut is more permeable.</p><p>Parenteral administration of colistin sulphate or colistimethate sodium to rats, rabbits and dogs has produced measurable levels of drug-related material in the plasma, although in the older studies it is not clear what is being measured and pharmacokinetic parameters have usually not been calculated.</p><p>In more recent studies in which free colistin and colistimethate moieties could be distinguished using an HPLC method, the plasma half-life of colistin was significantly longer than that of colistimethate following IV administration of colistimethate sodium to rats (55.7 and 23.6 minutes, respectively) and</p><p>to cystic fibrosis patients (251 minutes and 124 minutes, respectively).</p><p>The longer plasma half-life of colistin compared with colistimethate sodium suggests that its disposition after colistimethate sodium administration is rate-limited by its elimination and not by its formation from the hydrolysis of colistimethate sodium.</p><p>The plasma drug concentration in rabbits and dogs receiving a single IM dose of colistimethate sodium was higher and disappeared faster than the plasma drug concentration after a single IM dose of colistin sulphate. Higher plasma concentrations are also achieved in humans following IM administration of colistimethate compared with IM administration of colistin sulphate.</p><p>Higher serum drug concentrations and faster elimination were noted in rats following an IV dose compared with an IM dose of colistimethate. Similar patterns have been reported for rabbits, dogs and humans. In infants aged 4 to 51 days, mean serum half-life after a single IM dose of colistin (unspecified salt) was about 2.5 hours, which was only slightly shorter than that reported for adults (3.0 hours).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distribution</head><p>In vitro binding of colistimethate to dog plasma proteins was substantially less than that for colistin sulphate, with the latter showing concentration-dependence (decreased binding with increasing concentration).</p><p>Tissue binding of colistimethate sodium following single intravenous doses of 10 or 30mg/kg to rats showed highest serum and tissue drug concentrations at 0.5 hours (the first sampling time), except for Colobreathe Assessment report Page 16/66 the contents of the small intestine, which peaked at 1 hour post-dose. No drug was evident in the brain at any time. Tissue concentrations equal to, or above, serum levels were recorded for the kidney, small intestine and the small intestine contents, reflecting the presumed routes of elimination.</p><p>Neither polymyxin B sulphate nor colistimethate sodium accumulated in the serum following daily IM administration (2.5mg/kg/day) of the compounds to rabbits for 7 days, but both free and bound polymyxin B persisted in liver, kidney, muscle and brain for 5 days following dosing.</p><p>For colistimethate, bound drug concentrations increased in all tissues apart from serum with time, the highest concentrations being detected in the liver and muscle and the lowest concentration in the brain. Bound drug was lost most rapidly from the kidney over the 5-day period after the last dose, but tended to persist longer in the brain than other tissues. Free colistimethate was not found in the brain or lung 24 hours after each administration, but free colistimethate in kidney, liver and muscle declined slowly and was present (&gt;5μg/g, stated to be therapeutic concentrations) for up to four days after the last dose.</p><p>In rabbits, colistimethate appears to be incompletely converted to colistin in vivo.</p><p>Bound colistimethate appeared to reach saturation in rabbit brain, muscle and heart following twice daily dosing of colistimethate sodium for 7 days, with less evidence of saturation in the kidney and lung. Free colistimethate was not detected in the brain or lung, and levels in the heart, kidney, muscle and liver were low.</p><p>Tissue binding appears to be the main determinant of the distribution and persistence of colistimethate within the body.</p><p>In humans, polymyxins have been reported to persist in the liver, kidney, brain, heart and muscle, with colistimethate binding to a greater extent than polymyxin B to the kidney, lung and liver. The pattern is reversed in the brain and penetration into the CSF in humans is reportedly unpredictable and usually negligible.</p><p>No animal studies investigating placental transfer were located in the literature, but colistimethate sodium administered as a single intravenous dose to pregnant human volunteers in labour demonstrate that the drug crosses the placenta, with levels higher than those in maternal serum by 8 hours post-dose.</p><p>Intramuscular administration of colistin (unknown form) to cattle and sheep has demonstrated the presence of the drug in milk. Clinical studies have reportedly shown that colistin is secreted into human milk following administration of colistimethate sodium.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metabolism</head><p>Colistimethate appears to undergo limited metabolism. It undergoes hydrolysis to colistin base in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>In rabbits, colistin-N-glucuronide was detected following a single IV dose of colistimethate sodium, which accounted for 1.7 and 6.7% of the drug in the urine and bile, respectively, in the 24 hours after administration.</p><p>Measurement of the D-leucine content of colistin in dog urine by gas chromatography following IM administration of colistin sulphate indicated that a significantly greater proportion of the dose was present in the urine than was detected by bioassay. This suggests the presence of an (unidentified) inactive metabolite or metabolites.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Excretion</head><p>Colobreathe Assessment report Page 17/66</p><p>Following oral administration to laboratory animals and humans, colistimethate sodium was excreted in the faeces, mainly in a 'bound' form.</p><p>The urine is the major route of excretion following parenteral administration of colistimethate sodium in rats, rabbits, dogs and humans.</p><p>In rats, over 60% of an IV dose of colistimethate sodium was recovered in urine during the first 24 hours, the majority of that occurring in the first 12 hours. In rabbits, 74% of a dose was recovered in the urine, with a small proportion (0.12%) recovered in the bile within 24 hours. A similar pattern of urinary excretion was evident in humans (children and adults) but no biliary excretion has been reported in humans.</p><p>Glomerular filtration appears to be the main elimination process in dogs and humans. The dosage may require adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacokinetic drug interactions</head><p>No pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies were identified in the literature. Given the limited protein binding and lack of metabolism of colistin, pharmacokinetic interactions resulting from displacement of drug from plasma proteins or inhibition of drug-metabolising enzymes is not considered likely.</p><p>Clinical experience with colistimethate sodium and concomitant administration with other drugs commonly used in the treatment of cystic fibrosis has not provided evidence of pharmacokinetic interactions.</p><p>Concomitant use of colistimethate with non-depolarising muscle relaxants and medications that are nephrotoxic or neurotoxic should be undertaken with care, as the effects may be potentiated. It is stated in the non-clinical summary that polymyxins may possibly reduce the contraceptive effect of oestrogen but that the risk is probably small. The source of this information was unclear, and the published literature has been further discussed. Some antibiotics decrease the efficacy of oral contraceptives by induction of liver enzymes, whilst others do so by affecting gut bacteria. In general, the failure of oral contraception when taken concomitantly with most antibiotics occurs at a low rate and is similar to the rate of failure without concomitant antibiotics. There are no documented reports of interactions between polymyxins, colistin or colistimethate sodium and oral contraceptives, progesterone or oestrogen; therefore it is not necessary to include a warning in the SmPC.</p><p>Nevertheless, the applicant has now conducted a study to verify whether or not colistimethate sodium has the potential to induce liver enzymes. The study showed that concentrations up to 3500 ng/mL of colistin or up to 10500 ng/mL of colistimethate sodium did not induce the activity of CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 and 3A4/5) in cultured human hepatocytes. Appropriate prototypical inducers were included as positive controls and ensured the validity of the study. Therefore this in vitro study confirmed that colistin and colistimethate sodium are not inducers of these CYP enzymes.</p><p>Section 4.5 of the SmPC has been amended to include this information.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Single dose toxicity</head><p>Single dose toxicity studies were conducted over 35 years ago and were lethal dose tests. From the LD50 values reported in the literature, colistimethate sodium appears to be more acutely toxic to rats than to mice, but less acutely toxic in both species than colistin sulphate. However, colistimethate sodium shows a low order of acute toxicity, irrespective of the route of administration. Inhalation studies have not been reported. Lethal doses of colistin compounds caused muscular incoordination, Colobreathe Assessment report Page 18/66 respiratory distress and occasionally strychnine-like convulsions in mice. Paralysis of the respiratory muscles has been attributed to neuromuscular blockade.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeat dose toxicity</head><p>Inhalation toxicity studies have not been conducted with colistimethate sodium. Studies have been reported using oral and parenteral administration of colistimethate sodium, colistin sulphate and other polymyxins. As was seen in acute toxicity studies, colistin appears to be more toxic to rats than mice on repeated dosing, and colistimethate less toxic than colistin sulphate. In an early study, colistimethate sodium at 35.5mg/kg given twice daily (IM or IP) was lethal to rats. Findings included necrosis of the stomach mucosa and the proximal convoluted tubules in the kidneys.</p><p>In more recent studies in rats and mice following repeated IP dosing for at least 30 days, toxic effects included deaths, decreases in spontaneous activity, convulsions and alterations in haematological (haemoglobin, haematocrit, red blood cell count) and clinical chemistry (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, albumin to globulin ratio) parameters.</p><p>One reference noted "reactive symptoms" in liver, spleen and kidney in mice and in liver of rats, with hyperaemia noted in rat spleen. Unspecified histopathological changes in the kidney, liver and spleen were also reported following IP administration of colistimethate sodium to rats for 6 months.</p><p>An early subcutaneous dog study in which colistin sulphate was administered at 10000 or 20000U/kg three times daily for 21 days identified renal changes that were considered to be reversible.</p><p>The findings confirm those reported in the safety pharmacology section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genotoxicity</head><p>In vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies have been reported in the literature, most of which were conducted prior to the introduction of GLP standards. According to a report by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in 2006, there were three studies (reverse mutation in S typhimurium strains, forward mutation in V79 Chinese hamster cells and an in vivo mouse micronucleus test) that were reported in 1992 and stated to be GLP-compliant. These GLP-compliant studies were negative, as were the majority of the other published studies. One study was equivocal and another, an investigation of chromosome damage in human lymphocytes, was positive, although the methodology used in the latter study was questioned. On balance, the published literature suggests that 'colistin' (colistin sulphate or other unspecified salt) is not genotoxic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Carcinogenicity</head><p>Colistin sulphate and colistimethate sodium have been in use for decades in both human and veterinary medicine, without any reports of potential carcinogenic effects being published. Although no formal carcinogenicity studies have been conducted, colistimethate sodium does not appear to have any structural alerts, and the largely negative genotoxicity studies support the conclusion that the compound is unlikely to have carcinogenic potential.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reproduction Toxicity</head><p>A full range of reproductive toxicology studies has been reported in the literature. The studies were published in 1981 in Japanese, with English tables and translation of the abstracts and are stated to be conducted according to pre-ICH Japanese guidelines. The studies comprise male and female fertility in mice and rats; embryofetal development in mice, rats and rabbits, and peri-and postnatal Colobreathe Assessment report Page 19/66 development in rats. Thus the range of studies conducted is appropriate. However, toxicokinetic analyses were not carried out.</p><p>There were no notable effects on fertility or general reproductive performance in rats or mice. In embryo-fetal development studies in mice, resorptions and reduced ossification were seen, and in rats, reduced fetal weights, reduced ossification and at the high dose of 10mg colistin base/day, reduced post natal survival. No effects were reported in rabbits at IV doses of 80mg/kg colistimethate sodium (32mg colistin base/kg). The US labelling mentions a single report of talipes varus in rabbits given intramuscular colistimethate sodium (4.15 or 9.3mg/kg), which was apparently not clearly doserelated and was not seen in the Japanese study at higher doses.</p><p>There were no effects on prenatal or postnatal development or on maternal function in rats. Colistin has been shown to pass into milk in cattle, sheep and humans.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Toxicokinetic data</head><p>Most of the studies reviewed were carried out in the period 1960-1984 and toxicokinetic analysis is not mentioned. These studies also predated the publication of a reliable HPLC method for the separate determination of colistimethate species and free colistin; previously, biological activity of colistin was assayed. Consequently, comparative systemic exposure levels cannot be provided. The applicant discussed the absence of toxicokinetic data in the context of quality and clinical objections raised on the assay, disposition in the lung and systemic exposure. The applicant proposes to conduct a study in adults and children with cystic fibrosis to obtain PK data to establish the extent of any systemic exposure in the relevant patient population. A non-clinical study to investigate toxicokinetics and lung deposition following inhalation of colistimethate sodium is therefore not considered necessary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other toxicity studies</head><p>No other toxicity studies have been conducted or reported in the literature</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.5">Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment</head><p>An acceptable justification has been provided for the absence of an environmental risk assessment.</p><p>Colobreathe is intended as an alternative to the current use of nebulised colistimethate. The introduction of the product will therefore not increase the environmental exposure to colistimethate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.6">Discussion on non-clinical aspects</head><p>Polymyxins are a group of lipopeptide antibiotics isolated from Bacillus polymyxa.

There were no notable effects on fertility or general reproductive performance in male or female rats or mice. In embryo-fetal development studies in mice, resorptions and reduced ossification were seen, and in rats reduced fetal weights, reduced ossification and at the high dose of 10 mg colistin base per day, reduced post-natal</p><p>survival. An embryo-fetal study in rabbits reported no effects at intravenous doses up to 80 mg/kg colistimethate sodium (32 mg colistin base/kg).</p></div>

Two study sites in Poland and a CRO in the UK were inspected. The conduct of the trial was considered to be generally GCP compliant in both clinical sites in Poland. It was the opinion of the inspectors that the data recorded and reported by both of the inspected sites were trustworthy and reliable. There was one finding during the inspection of the CRO that was graded as major/critical. The critical finding pertained to the finding that the processes for assigning patients to ITT and PP datasets were inconsistent. The applicant has adequately addressed the observations made during the inspection and CHMP does not consider that the data are a cause of concern.</p><p>Colobreathe Assessment report Page 21/66 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tabular overview of clinical studies</head><p>The clinical development programme for Colobreathe is based on five clinical studies tabulated below: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PPL-252</head><p>Assessing total and regional lung deposition of colistimethate sodium delivered using a dry powder inhaler and a nebuliser device in volunteers with cystic fibrosis -a pilot study.</p><p>The CF patients were randomised to receive a single dose of one of three treatments on separate study days, radiolabelled with 99mTc as follows: Regimen A: Inhalation of 1 million IU (80mg) of Colomycin® Injection, using a Medic-Aid Ventstream® nebuliser with a standard flow rate of more than 8L/min, producing an estimated 80% of the aerosol mass in droplets of less than 5μm diameter. Inhalation continued until the chamber reached at least the minimum volume (approximately 0.5-0.75mL) or until the chamber was dry. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><p>Of the 492 plasma samples tested approximately 90% had results below LLQ (either 1 or 2 mg/L) and 479 had results &lt; 3 mg/L. Values in individual subjects were mostly up to 3.8 mg/L but some outliers showed concentrations &gt; 32 mg/L, 29 mg/L and 6.7 mg/L.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><p>In the urine samples from initial sites all except three subjects had at least one urinary concentration &gt; 2 mg/L reported. Concentrations &gt; 20 mg/L occurred commonly but 30/496</p><p>samples gave values of around 30 mg/L or higher and approximately half of these results were in children aged less than 18 years (some had levels &gt; 64 or &gt; 128 mg/L reported).</p><p>These data remain unexplained (e.g. they cannot be explained by inadequate inactivation of other antibacterial agents in samples) and therefore the possibility that these unusually high plasma and</p><p>urine levels indicate that a substantial part of the dose may be absorbed by some patients cannot be dismissed.</p><p>The applicant was requested to conduct an additional pharmacokinetic study across the full age range and using two assays (one microbiological) to further evaluate systemic absorption in association with dry powder inhalation. This study had commenced but only very limited data were available before an opinion was reached on the application. The full data will be reported and will be used to update the SmPC as seems necessary. Meanwhile it can only be stated that in subjects with CF aged from 13 years systemic exposure after one week of twice daily dosing with Colobreathe was associated with considerably lower plasma levels than have been reported in published literature after intravenous dosing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distribution</head><p>Lung deposition and distribution of Tc99-radiolabelled colistimethate sodium after 1,662,500 IU dry powder inhalation (with and without pre-treatment with inhaled salbutamol by MDI) was compared to nebulisation of 1 million IU in study PPL-252 in 10 volunteers with CF.</p><p>Following administration of 1 million IU colistin in solution using a nebuliser (Regimen A) 49.9% of the dose was retained in the nebuliser while an average 5.9% of the dose was deposited in the whole lung.</p><p>On average, and based on the corrected data, 11.9% of the dose was deposited in the lungs from dry powder inhaled using the Turbospin device following pre-treatment with salbutamol (B) compared to 11.6% without pre-treatment with salbutamol (C). Without any correction being made for the difference in particle size differences the whole lung deposition from the dry powder administered via the Turbospin device averaged 19.3% and 18.7% of the dose with or without pre-treatment with salbutamol, respectively.</p><p>The lung penetration index was on average 1.8  0.5 for the nebuliser, 1.5  0.5 for the dry powder via the Turbospin device following pre-treatment with salbutamol and 1.2  0.5 without pre-treatment.</p><p>Percentages of the dose deposited in the oropharynx were 2.9%, 70.4% and 71.1%, respectively. The FEV 1 data indicated that none of the subjects suffered periods of bronchospasm.</p><p>Colobreathe Assessment report Page 24/66 From the literature, it appears that plasma protein binding of colistin is low. One study in cystic fibrosis patients estimated the steady-state volume of distribution as 0.09 L/kg. Considerable amounts of colistin can cross the placenta and also enter breast milk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Elimination</head><p>Regarding metabolism, colistimethate sodium is converted to colistin and various sulphomethylated derivatives in vitro and in vivo. As somewhere between 40-80% of the intravenous dose (depending on the publication) can be recovered unchanged in the urine and there is no biliary excretion it is assumed that the remaining drug is inactivated in the tissues. The mechanism is unknown. One study in CF patients suggested that pulmonary clearance via sputum may contribute to total clearance.</p><p>From the literature it appears that the main route of elimination of the polymyxins is by renal excretion. It has been reported that in subjects with normal renal function about 40% of a parenteral dose of colistimethate sodium is recovered in the urine within 8 h and around 80% in 24 h.</p><p>After inhalation by nebulisation, variable amounts of a colistimethate dose have been reported to appear in urine. Using HPLC to quantify polymyxin E1 one paper reported that a mean of 4.3 ± 1.3% of the inhaled dose of 2 million IU was detected in the urine, with a high variability in the results (range 0.3 -24.2%). The rate of removal during peritoneal dialysis has been reported to be 1 mg/L but haemodialysate contained no detectable levels.</p><p>It has also been reported that whereas colistimethate sodium is renally eliminated and the urinary excretion involves renal tubular secretion, colistin itself is eliminated predominantly by the non-renal route with very extensive renal tubular re-absorption. Another report mentions that after parenteral administration of colistimethate sodium in CF patients the plasma half-life of colistimethate sodium (124 ± 52 min) is approximately one-half that of the colistin generated from it (251 ± 79 min).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dose proportionality and time dependencies</head><p>Not applicable.</p><p>Colobreathe Assessment report Page 25/66</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special populations</head><p>It has been reported that colistimethate sodium kinetics appears to be similar in children and adults, including the elderly, provided renal function is normal. In the current application the intended age range for dosing is from 6 years upwards. Although ~40% of subjects in the Phase 3 study were aged &lt; 18 years, the PK data generated were not considered sufficiently reliable to determine systemic exposure by age group. It is also not possible to reliably assess any possible differences in systemic exposure between nebulised and dry powder doses in any age group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacokinetic interaction studies</head><p>No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted. This fact has been stated in the SmPC. A cautious approach has been taken with regard to the wording due to the lack of reliable data on systemic exposure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.3">Pharmacodynamics</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanism of action</head><p>Colistin is a cyclic polypeptide antibiotic derived from Bacillus polymyxa var. colistinus and belongs to the polymyxin group. Colistin is a mixture of polymyxin A (E1) and B (E2) and is often just denoted as polymyxin E. In solution there is hydrolysis of colistimethate sodium to E1 and E2.</p><p>The polymyxin antibiotics are cationic agents that work by damaging the cell membrane. The resulting physiological effects are lethal to the bacterium. Since the mechanism of action of the polymyxins is different from that of other antibacterial agents, resistance to colistin and polymyxin B by means of changes in lipid phosphate groups would not be expected to result in resistance to other drug classes. However, some bacteria may show crossresistance to polymyxins and agents in other classes as a result of impermeability and/or efflux pumps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary and Secondary pharmacology</head><p>The applicant has not conducted any studies of the in-vitro activity of colistin. Literature reports were summarised but in many cases it is not known which substance was used for in-vitro testing or the methodology that was applied. For example, in-vitro activity was assessed against 385 mucoid and non-mucoid strains of P. aeruginosa isolated from 192 sputa that were obtained from 57 adult CF patients during 1998-1999 in Germany. Only 38% of the non-mucoid and 45% of the mucoid strains were susceptible at 2 mg/L. In contrast a recent study in Turkey, which tested isolates from CF patients in Istanbul, the MIC90 for colistin methanesulfonate was 2 mg/L. A survey of P. aeruginosa isolates from CF patients in the UK showed that 96.9% were susceptible to colistin based on the BSAC breakpoints operative at the time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary pharmacology</head><p>Colistin has long been known to exert an effect on nerve conduction that appears to be related to an ability to inhibit acetylcholine release at somatic nerve endings in skeletal muscle. Weakness and paralysis can result if plasma concentrations are allowed to increase unnecessarily and/or if colistin is co-administered with other drugs (e.g. curariform agents) that have this effect. An exacerbation of myasthenia gravis is also possible. However, the effect of colistin on sensory nerves and its ability to trigger vertigo and ataxia seem to be mediated by a different mechanism that has not been elucidated.</p><p>The effect of colistin on renal function is not well understood although some studies have shown a decrease in creatinine and urea clearance during therapy.</p><p>When administered by inhalation of colistimethate sodium in solution via nebulisation local bronchoconstriction has been reported to occur as has been described with other inhaled antibacterial agents. This effect is distinct from the true hypersensitivity reactions that may occasionally occur and may be due simply to a local irritation effect on the mucosa. Published data suggest that a significant drop in FEV1 occurs in &lt; 20% of subjects. The applicant assessed the potential for Colobreathe to trigger bronchoconstriction in two studies: * In DPI 98/01 bronchoconstrictive effects were compared following administration of nebulised (1 million IU) and micronised (i.e. 1,662,500 IU dry powder) colistimethate sodium in healthy subjects.</p><p>The dry powder was administered with and without pre-medication with inhaled salbutamol (by MDI).</p><p>Subjects underwent continuous specific airways conductance measurements (sGaw) in a whole body plethysmograph at four hours following each dosing. Forced expiratory volume (FEV 1 ) was measured at baseline and at four hours post-inhalation on each study day.</p><p>A mean of 82% of the mass of colistimethate sodium dry powder was delivered when Colobreathe was administered after salbutamol pre-medication (103 mg; SD 44) and 90% was delivered when</p><p>Colobreathe was administered alone (113 mg; SD 37). There were no clinically significant differences in mean FEV 1 (L) (pre-dose, 4 hours post-dose) between nebulised and dry powder treatment regimens. Mean percentage change in FEV 1 4 hours post-dose (2.7, SD 5.2) was slightly greater for dry powder plus salbutamol pre-medication than for nebulisation (-0.9, SD 6.2) and dry powder alone (-0.2, SD 4.1).</p><p>Mean sGaw (s -1 kPa -1 ) readings post dose showed no significant differences between groups from baseline to 240 min post-dose. However, the percentage change in sGaw measurements over baseline (up to 200 min post-dose) was greater for dry powder with salbutamol pre-medication than with dry powder alone, showing an improvement in airways resistance. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mean Percentage Change in Specific Airway Conductance</head><p>In a published study that investigated inhalation of 25 mg dry powder colistin sulphate a decrease in pulmonary function was observed for six healthy volunteers (FEV 1 mean percentage change at 3.5 h of -2.78%) and five patients (FEV 1 mean percentage change at 3.5 h of -6.62%) after dosing. The FEV1</p><p>and specific airway conductance readings obtained in study DPI 98/01 indicated that inhalation of nebulised and dry powder colistimethate did not induce any degree of bronchoconstriction in healthy volunteers. This finding is contrary to the published study using the sulphate and would be consistent with lack of hydrolysis in vivo of colistimethate to colistin sulphate.</p><p>* In DPI 98/02 an additional control arm (micronised lactose powder) was added compared to DPI 98/01 with the aim of determining whether any bronchoconstriction observed was due simply to the physical properties of inhaling 1,662,500 IU (125mg) dry powder. The study was therefore a foursegment, single-dose cross-over study involving 12 adult subjects with CF.</p><p>A mean of 76% of the mass of colistimethate sodium dry powder was delivered when it was administered alone (94 mg, SD 30) compared to a mean of 90% delivered when it was delivered with salbutamol pre-medication (112 mg, SD 40). These results were consistent with the data from DPI 98/01 in healthy volunteers. A mean of 51% of the mass of micronised lactose was delivered (64 mg, SD 43) and it was considered that poor flow from the capsule was a possible explanation for this relatively low delivery.</p><p>There was a wide range in baseline pulmonary function with a mean FEV 1 % predicted of 50% but a range from 21% -98%. However, there was no correlation between baseline FEV 1 % predicted and the mass of micronised dry powder delivered. The applicant considered that the Turbospin inhaler was reliable in delivering a consistent mass (albeit greater than anticipated from preceding in-vitro studies) of micronised colistimethate sodium irrespective of lung function status.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Colobreathe</head><p>Assessment report Page 28/66</p><p>There were no clinically significant differences of mean FEV 1 , FVC, PEF or MMEF (pre-dose up to 240 minutes post-dose) between the four different treatment regimens. The mean percentage change in FEV 1 over 4 h was slightly greater for colistin with salbutamol pre-medication compared with colistin alone. However, no clinically significant decrease in pulmonary function was observed after colistin administration and there were no clinically significant differences in pulmonary function between treatments. It was concluded that the nebulised and micronised powder formulations of colistimethate sodium did not induce bronchoconstriction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.4">Discussion on clinical pharmacology</head><p>The erratic PK results reported in the initial dossier could reflect several factors but it remains impossible to dismiss the possibility that some of the reported high concentrations could be real. was to leave the Turbospin and get absorbed from the lungs and oropharynx the systemic exposure should be considerably less than that associated with IV dosing.</p><p>The applicant has commenced a new study that will generate PK data across age groups and will use biological and non-biological assays. Meanwhile, since theoretical considerations all point to much lower systemic exposure using Colobreathe vs. intravenous dosing it was considered that the outlier results obtained using the microbiological assay most likely reflect unidentified errors. Nevertheless, until such time as the new study provides information on systemic exposure across age groups the SmPC must take a cautious approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.5">Conclusions on clinical pharmacology</head><p>The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology:</p><p>Full data to be reported on the ongoing additional pharmacokinetic study across the full age range and using two assays (one microbiological) to further evaluate systemic absorption in association with dry powder inhalation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.1">Dose response studies</head><p>No formal dose-ranging studies have been performed with Colobreathe. The selection of the dose for main trial is defined by the deposition study using radio labelled colistimethate sodium (Study PPL-252). In this study 125mg colistimethate DP for inhalation was calculated to give similar whole lung deposition to 2-3 Million International Units (160-240mg) colistimethate when given using a Medic-Aid Ventstream® nebuliser. The recommended nebulised dose is 2 million IU (160mg) for children and adults and therefore 125mg (1.6 million IU) was selected as an appropriate dose. The study was conducted and monitored on behalf of the sponsor by a UK-based CRO.</p><p>This was the single pivotal Phase 3 study in the application.

Most pertinent of these were evidence of an acute respiratory exacerbation at Visit 1, hypersensitivity or previous intolerance to colistimethate sodium or β2 agonists, pregnancy or breastfeeding, patients receiving anti-pseudomonal agents specifically for the treatment of an exacerbation or pre-scheduled prophylactic courses of oral antibacterial agents at Visit 1 (but see permitted treatments below) and those with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. twice daily for inhalation using a Turbospin device or 300 mg TOBI twice daily by nebulisation using a PARI LC Plus nebuliser. The dose interval was to be as close as possible to 12 hours and not less than 6 hours for both regimens. The general treatment plan over the 24 weeks of the study was as follows:</p></div>

All children had to have a responsible adult to supervise (as far as possible) study treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives</head><p>The primary objective was to quantify any change in FEV1 % predicted compared to baseline (on entry to the study at Visit 1 [Day 1]). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcomes/endpoints</head><p>The primary efficacy variable was the change in FEV1 % predicted from baseline (Visit 1) to Week 24 (Visit 6). The FEV1 % predicted = [Highest FEV1 / predicted FEV1] * 100. The change from baseline to Week 24 of FEV1 % predicted results was summarised separately for patients who completed the study (i.e. with a baseline and a Week 24 result) and for all patients using LOCF imputation to Week 24 for missing data.</p><p>Respiratory function tests (spirometry and expiratory curve of the flow volume loop) were measured using suitable equipment (spirometry or body plethysmography) that was capable of printing records that could be stored with the patient's CRF. All testing was performed according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria. Pulmonary function testing was carried out at each visit by an independent observer who was unaware of the patient's treatment assignment.</p><p>For a given patient, pulmonary function testing was performed at the same time of day for each study assessment. There was a minimum time window of 2 hours between inhalation of bronchodilator agents (whether short-or long-acting) and performance of spirometry.</p><p>MICs of colistin and tobramycin against P. aeruginosa were determined using the E-test system at a reference laboratory (UK HPA). If resistance appeared to develop during the study the isolates from individual patients were investigated by PFGE of DNA macrorestriction digests.</p><p>The QoL questionnaires for CF used were those developed in the United States by Quittner, based on versions that were first developed in France. The CFQ-Rs were completed at Visit 1 (study start) and then at Visits 2, 5, and 6. Patients who shifted questionnaire age brackets during the study did not switch CFQ-R version.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample size</head><p>Based on the publication of Ramsey et al. <ref type="bibr">(1999)</ref> with preservative-free TOBI it was assumed that the SD of the primary outcome variable (FEV1 % predicted) was about 16%. To test for this hypothesis, the 95% two-sided CI for the difference between the two groups was computed and if the lower limit was not less than -3.0% then non-inferiority was to be accepted. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Randomisation</head><p>Randomisation and recruitment was as follows:</p><p> At study entry (with or without completion of the run-in period) patients were randomised to treatment (1:1) using an interactive voice response system (IVRS).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><p>The block size used for each centre's first allocation was 6. A block size of 4 applied thereafter.</p><p> Each centre was to recruit approximately 3 to 10 patients although it was envisaged that certain specialist CF centres (with a significant number of patients routinely nebulising TOBI) would recruit larger numbers of patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><p>The statistical analysis was planned to investigate whether there were any centre effects and whether any particular centres were influencing the outcome.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Blinding (masking)</head><p>The study report states that a double-blind design was not feasible in light of obvious differences in the administration method. Using a double-dummy approach would have ruled out an assessment of any potential administration advantages of Colobreathe over TOBI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical methods</head><p>Initially there were three populations defined for the analyses as follows:</p><p> Safety population: all randomised and treated patients.  Per Protocol (PP) population: all randomised and treated patients who met the criteria for efficacy evaluable patients and did not meet the violation criteria. This population was used for the primary efficacy endpoint and other pulmonary function endpoints only.</p><p>An additional analysis was performed for the patients with a baseline and week 24 result (i.e.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>completers).</head><p>For the analysis of the primary endpoint the applicant calculated the actual difference between treatments in mean FEV1% predicted at week 24 i.e. expressed in difference in percentage points. This approach was in line with the derivation of the non-inferiority margin recommendation by the CHMP. A 95% two-sided CI, based on the ANCOVA model, was computed for the difference of Colobreathe minus TOBI. If the lower bound was no lower than -3% for both the PP and ITT populations it was to be concluded that Colobreathe was non-inferior to TOBI. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed using main effects of treatment, baseline FEV1 % predicted and pooled centre. Adjusted means by treatment were presented as well as an estimate of the difference between adjusted means.</p><p>The analysis was presented for patients who completed the study and also for all patients using a method of LOCF imputation to Week 24 for missing data.</p><p>Colobreathe Assessment report Page 33/66</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participant flow</head><p>The figure below summarises patient disposition. The percentage of patients who completed the study was numerically higher in the TOBI group, reflecting a higher number of patients in the Colobreathe group whose primary reason for withdrawal was at least one AE.

The most important reduced the lower age limit from 8 to 6 years and added a run-in for countries where TOBI was not routinely available or used (Russia, Ukraine and UK).</p><p>Colobreathe Assessment report Page 34/66</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baseline data</head><p>The ITT population comprised 170 (45.5%) female and 204 (54.5%) male patients. The mean age was 21.1 years with a range from 6 to 56 years and overall 59% were aged &gt; 18 years (59%) while 18%</p><p>were aged 6 to 12 years and 23% were aged 13 to 17 years. However, the distribution of children across sites was uneven. At the Ukraine sites 53/66 (80%) were less than 18 years old, including 34 (52%) aged 6-12 years, 19 (28%) aged 13-17 years and only 13 (20%) adults. In contrast, at the non-Ukraine sites only 104 (33%) were aged &lt; 18 years with 35 (11%) aged 6-12 years and 69 (22%) aged 13-17 years. Therefore, the Ukraine contributed 34/69 (49%) of the total aged 6-12 years in the entire study, 22% of all patients aged 13-17 years and &lt;10% of the adults.</p><p>In all three analysis sets, the two treatment groups were comparable with respect to all demographic parameters. There were no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups with respect to disease-related baseline characteristics. In particular, 44.8% and 49.7% per group had a baseline FEV1 % predicted that was &lt; 50% (noting that the "baseline" value was almost always the screening value since most patients had a combined screening/baseline visit).    In the PP population, the corresponding adjusted difference was -1.49% (95% CI: -3.79%, 0.81%) in the LOCF analysis with -0.99% (95% CI: -3.48%, 1.51%) for patients who completed the study.</p><p>Therefore the criterion for concluding non-inferiority was not met. The treatment-by-pooled centre interaction was not statistically significant and was therefore not included in the model. Also, no difference in the drop-out rates was detected. However, because of an indication of departures from normality, the ANCOVA using the main effects of treatment, baseline FEV1% predicted and pooled centre was repeated on logarithmically transformed data. Comparisons between treatment groups were presented as ratios. The non-inferiority criterion for the lower limit of the 95% CI of -3% for the treatment difference was equivalent to a lower limit of 0.94 for the treatment ratio. This ratio of 0.94 comes from the fact that as the middle of the inclusion criterion is a predicted FEV1% of 50%, an absolute change of 3% is a relative change of 6%.</p><p>In the ITT population, the adjusted mean ratio was 0.980 (95% CI: 0.943, 1.018) in the LOCF analysis and 0.994 (95% CI: 0.955, 1.035) for patients who completed the study. When the treatment ratio was converted to a treatment difference using the unadjusted TOBI geometric mean as the multiplier in the conversion formula, the adjusted mean difference was -0.97% (95% CI: -2.74%, 0.86%) in the LOCF analysis and -0.29% (95% CI: -2.21%, 1.71%) for patients who completed the study. Therefore the criterion for non-inferiority was met. The corresponding results for the PP population showed that the criterion for non-inferiority was marginally missed in the PP LOCF analysis but was met in the PP completers analysis. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Change in FEV1% predicted at Week 24 (ITT population) -data logarithmically transformed</head><p>In the logarithmic transformation analyses a significant (just) treatment-by-pooled centre interaction was observed in the ITT LOCF analysis (p=0.0495) but this was not found in the ITT completers (p=0.1192), PP LOCF (p=0.1203) or PP completers (p=0.3070). The interaction was explained by the fact that in some pooled centres the treatment effect was in favour of Colobreathe and in others it was in favour of TOBI. Accordingly additional exploratory analyses were performed on logarithmically transformed data that included the interaction term in the model. In the ITT population, the table shows that the pre-defined criterion for non-inferiority was met in the LOCF and completers analyses when the treatment by centre interaction was included in the model.  The figure above shows the FEV1% predicted change from baseline for all ITT patients and for Ukrainian versus non-Ukrainian patients who were included in the ITT population. It becomes clear that across all the Ukrainian centres the change from baseline was greater for both treatments (and despite the TOBI run-in period) compared to the non-Ukrainian patients. After exclusion of the Ukrainian patients the non-inferiority criterion was reached for both (LOCF) ITT (-1.67%) and PP (-2.4%) populations (using type III estimates). The criterion was also met for the completers. An additional analysis of the primary efficacy variable after excluding Ukraine was performed using type II estimates. In the LOCF analysis, the adjusted treatment difference in the change in FEV1 % predicted at Week 24 analysis was -1.36% (95% CI: -3.25, 0.54) for all patients in the ITT population. In completers, the adjusted treatment difference was -0.75% (95% CI: -2.81%, 1.31%) in the ITT population.</p><p>The following analyses were performed using the untransformed data.</p><p>The change in FEV1 % predicted at Week 24 according to baseline FEV1 subgroups (&lt;/&gt; 50% predicted) gave comparable results for the two treatment groups. In the ITT population, the lower limit of the 95% CI was above -3% for the FEV1 &lt;50% predicted subgroup but not the FEV1 ≥50% predicted subgroup. Similar results were obtained for the PP population in the LOCF and completers analysis. The applicant provided additional tabulations of percentages with positive and negative changes in FEV1% predicted from baseline to week 24 by 3, 6 and 9 percentage points for all patients, by the three age groups and also according to baseline FEV1% predicted &lt;/&gt; 50%. In the categorical analysis for all ITT patients there was no consistent trend in favour of either treatment. Using the LOCF but not using the completers approach there were more Colobreathe patients with negative changes but this only occurred in the last category (&gt;-9%).</p><p>The 6-12 years group showed larger numbers in the Colobreathe group with the greatest positive changes from baseline (12 vs. 7) whereas the opposite occurred in the adolescents (7 vs. 13). Among the adults the results were comparable across all categories of change from baseline. For patients with baseline FEV1 values of &lt; 50% and ≥ 50% there were no consistent trends. However, the subset with higher baseline values showed larger numbers in the Colobreathe with the last category negative change. For the most part the same patterns applied in the tabulations of the PP population data although numbers and differences between groups were mostly smaller.</p><p>In the ITT population, the FEV1 % predicted values at Week 24 for the two treatments were comparable within each age sub-group but the lower limit of the 95% CI was above -3% only for adults (59% of the study population). Similar results were obtained for the PP population in the LOCF and completers analysis. Due to the preponderance of children enrolled at the Ukraine sites and in light of the additional tabulations that showed a particular advantage for Colobreathe at the Ukraine sites but not at other sites among those aged 6-12 years it seemed that it was the Ukraine data that was driving the overall finding shown below that the benefit of Colobreathe might be most marked for the youngest group. In contrast, the FVE1% data suggested least benefit for the adolescents and broadly comparable benefit for the adults.</p><p>It was considered that these findings merited further exploration and additional questions have been suggested for the D180 LoOI. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Change from baseline (untransformed data from CSR)</head><p>In the ITT population, the change in FEV1% predicted values from baseline to Week 24 showed slightly greater treatment differences in female patients. The lower limit of the 95% CI was above -3% for the male completer patients only. Similar results were obtained for the PP population in the LOCF and completers analysis, although the lower limit of the 95% CI was below -3% for all analyses.</p><p>In the ITT population, the change in FEV1 % predicted values from baseline to Week 24 showed that treatment differences in patients who had not used azithromycin or dornase alpha at baseline were higher than in patients who had. The lower limit of the 95% CI was above -3% for the patients who had used azithromycin or dornase alpha at baseline only. Similar results were obtained for the PP population in the LOCF and completers analysis although the lower limit of the 95% CI was below -3%</p><p>for each analysis.</p><p>The use and timing of use of bronchodilators was comparable between treatments with little change during the 24 weeks of study except that slightly more Ukraine patients started salbutamol during the study period. The applicant was asked to evaluate the possible effects of allowing spirometry to be performed when only 2 h had elapsed since use of a bronchodilator. Further statistical analyses for FEV1 at 24 weeks (logarithmically transformed data) were performed according to use of bronchodilators in the ITT population. Patients were categorised according to no use within 4 weeks of FEV1 measurement or use afterwards only vs. those for whom the CRF indicated bronchodilator use prior to the FEV1 measurement. These additional analyses (for LOCF ITT and PP populations) supported the efficacy of Colobreathe among patients who did not take bronchodilators within 4 hours of pulmonary function testing and/or were not taking bronchodilating drugs.</p><p>Colobreathe Assessment report Page 42/66</p><p>Other pulmonary function tests  The adjusted treatment difference for the change in FVC from baseline to Week 24/Exit Visit (Visit 6) was 0.01 L (95% CI: -0.09, 0.10 L) in the ITT population (p=0.886) and -0.02 L (95% CI: -0.12, 0.08 L) in the PP population (p=0.697).   For the ITT and PP populations, the analyses of the other pulmonary function tests by paediatric age group showed a small number of detectable treatment differences, which are shown in the table below. These were all in favour of the comparative therapy. However, the actual differences were small. </p></div>

The mean period of time to non-protocol-defined acute exacerbations was 83.32 days in the Colobreathe group compared to 67.06 days in the TOBI group.</p><p>The mean time to first additional anti-pseudomonal treatment was 55.28 days in the Colobreathe group and 51.79 days in the TOBI group. The results of the PP population were similar and confirmed the ITT results.

The results of the PP population were similar and confirmed the ITT results.</p><p>In the 6-12 years ITT and PP populations, the mean time to acute exacerbation was nearly twice as long in the Colobreathe group compared to the TOBI group. There was also a substantial difference between the treatment groups for time to first additional anti-pseudomonal treatment. There was an advantage for TOBI in adolescents and a modest advantage for Colobreathe in adults. </p></div>

This summary should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections). at the beginning and between treatment periods. At randomisation patients were stratified by age to receive either Colobreathe (1) or nebulised treatment (2) first.</p><p>No relevant changes in FEV1% predicted and FVC were seen from the baseline to end of the respective treatment period. Additionally, statistical testing (paired t-test) showed no significant differences in changes in FEV1% predicted between the two treatments. FEV1% predicted tended to be higher in those &lt; 14 years vs. &gt; 14 years but within each age stratum no clear differences were seen between the dry powder and the nebulised treatments. There were also no consistent differences in FVC between the two treatments in either age stratum. The results for the per protocol and safety sets were comparable.</p><p>All patients with values who received the dry powder first and then the nebulised treatment rated the latter as much harder (62.5%) or a little harder (25%) to use than the former treatment. In line with this finding, all patients with values who received the nebulised treatment first and then the dry powder rated the latter as much easier (62.5% of patients) or a little easier (25%) to use than the first treatment (i.e. nebulised). Patients aged &lt; 14 years were more likely to report better ease of use for dry powder (75% rated dry powder as much easier to use in the safety set and 100% in the per protocol set) than patients aged &gt; 14 years (50% rated dry powder as much easier to use in the safety set and 66.7% in the per protocol set).</p><p>When adolescents and adults completed the CFQ the scores remained about the same or decreased from Visit 1 to end of treatment in both treatment groups for most of the domains. A clear increase was only seen for the total treatment score in the dry powder group. When the parents/caregivers completed the CFQ for children a clear increase in mean scores from Visit 1 was seen during treatment with dry powder for the total body score, the total treatment score, the total school score and the total digestion score. With the exception of the total school score where the reverse was the case these increases were greater during dry powder treatment. A pronounced decrease from Visit 1 to end of treatment was seen for the total weight score during both treatments with the decrease being greater on dry powder. For the remaining scores, no major changes were seen.</p><p>Colobreathe Assessment report Page 49/66</p></div>

This non-inferiority margin was based on the pooled results of two placebo-controlled nebulised tobramycin studies conducted during the 1990s. The published analysis showed that at week 24 the relative change from baseline was by about +8% for TOBI and -2% for placebo. At week 20 the TOBI group had a 10% relative increase in FEV1% predicted compared to -2% in the placebo group.</p><p>Since the baseline mean FEV1% predicted was almost exactly 50% in both treatment groups these data equated with approximately 6 and 5 percentage point differences in actual FEV1% predicted mean values at weeks 20 and 24, respectively. Thus, CHMP had considered that a non-inferiority margin not in excess of -2.5% could be supported at week 24 for COLO/DPI/02/06. The changes in treatment of CF and in FEV1% values since the 1990s add to the difficulties raised by possible lack of constancy but there are no other suitable data to assist in defining an appropriate non-inferiority margin from past studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy data and additional analyses</head><p>The applicant pre-defined a 3% non-inferiority margin at least partly on grounds that this would be a clinically acceptable difference. In the pre-planned primary analysis the lower bound of the 95% CI was -2.59% for patients who completed the study in the ITT population but for the ITT LOCF and both the PP analyses the lower bound of the 95% CI exceeded -3%. The corresponding analyses using logarithmic transformation of the data gave lower 95% CI from -2.20 to -3.08 and the non-parametric analyses gave lower 95% CI from -1.43 to -2.49.</p><p>There are several other observations that need to be taken into account when considering these overall comparisons. For example, at week 24 subjects in the comparative group had been off treatment for 4 weeks and therefore might represent a time point at which a comparison could potentially bias</p><p>Colobreathe. The comparison of data at week 20 indicated that the lower bound of the 95% CI exceeded -3.5%. As described above, there were clear differences according to age groups with suggestions of an advantage for Colobreathe in those aged 6-12 years, a disadvantage in the adolescents aged 13-18 years and very comparable results in the adults. Most of the children aged 6-12 years had been enrolled at Ukraine sites, where the benefit of Colobreathe was anyway seemingly larger and this could be driving these observations.</p><p>The conclusion was that Colobreathe is probably not quite as good as TOBI across pooled age groups but still within a range that would exclude significant clinical differences. In addition, there was a clear patient preference for Colobreathe. Quality of life assessment supported the use of Colobreathe and "Time to exacerbation" also tended to favour Colobreathe. After resolution of all the questions, including the provision of several additional analyses to provide reassurance regarding the robustness of the single pivotal study, it was concluded that making available an alternative dry powder inhalation that requires only two inhalations per day could be regarded as an advantage to patients in terms of convenience and likely without clinical significant disadvantage in terms of lung function..</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COLO/DPI/02/05</head><p>Regardless of the sequence in which they used dry powder and nebulised colistin, most patients with values found the dry powder easier to use. The tendency for a better ease of use assessment for dry powder than nebulised treatment was more pronounced in children than in adults. Changes in FEV1% predicted appeared to be slightly better with nebulisation, but there was no significant difference between treatments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.4">Conclusions on the clinical efficacy</head><p>Based on all the lung function data the overall picture pointed to a conclusion that Colobreathe may be slightly less optimal than TOBI . However, the fact remains that most differences vs. TOBI were actually quite small (within an acceptable range) whilst there were also some clear advantages noted for Colobreathe in sub-populations. These observations were weighed against patient opinions regarding ease of use and quality of life data that favoured Colobreathe.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient exposure</head><p>Exposure ranged from single doses to 24 weeks treatment with Colobreathe.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse events</head><p>In COLO/DPI/98/01 the 12 healthy subjects reported 60 AEs, all of which were of mild intensity.</p><p>Cough, throat irritation and unpleasant taste were all more common after dry powder inhalations than after nebulised colistimethate sodium. There was no appreciable difference with salbutamol pretreatment except for nausea and dizziness, which may have been due to use of the beta-agonist by subjects not accustomed to these agents. Similarly, in PPL-252 nine of the 10 subjects reported AEs.</p><p>These were mainly cough, unpleasant taste and throat irritation. Three subjects also reported wheezing. Most were of mild intensity. In COLO/DPI/98/02 14 AEs were reported by the 12 subjects with CF, all of which were of mild intensity. There was no excess of AEs during dry powder inhalations, with or without salbutamol pre-treatment, compared to nebulised colistin.</p><p>In COLO/DPI/02/05 the safety assessments included spontaneously reported AEs and solicited symptoms. All except one patient reported solicited symptoms in the dry powder phase compared to one third in the nebulised colistin phase. The difference was mostly accounted for by reports of unpleasant taste, throat irritation and new cough/increase in cough. There were no major differences in reporting between the adults and the children. The majority of AEs were of mild or moderate intensity. Severe AES were reported by six patients in the dry powder phase and one in the nebulised phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COLO/DPI/02/06</head><p>The overall comparison between treatment groups is shown in the table. In interpreting these figures it must be remembered that all subjects had already been exposed to the comparative treatment whether pre-study or in the run-in phase.</p><p>Colobreathe Assessment report Page 51/66   Adverse reactions (possibly, probably or definitely related or with an unknown relationship to study medication) are summarised in the table below, which expresses rates in terms of percentages of patients reporting an ADR. Cough, unpleasant taste and throat irritation were the most commonly reported ADRs in both treatment groups but were reported more often with Colobreathe. There was no clear trend for these ADRs to increase in frequency with increasing age although adults had the highest rates in each treatment group for many of the AEs listed. Despite this, adults very commonly considered these ADRs to be of mild intensity. The data did not suggest consistent trends for agerelated reporting of AEs or ADRs. The types of AEs reported most often in children resembled those reported in adults and rates were often slightly lower in children compared to older subjects.</p><p>In order to put the findings into perspective, the applicant pointed out that an increased risk of local irritation from inhalation of a dry powder compared to a nebulised mist was reported in studies that compared these modes of administration for tobramycin. For example, Geller et al <ref type="formula">(2007)</ref>   </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COLO/DPI/02/06</head><p>Laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs (there were no laboratory SAEs) in the Colobreathe group included increased neutrophil count (n=3 patients), hyperglycaemia (3), increased ALT <ref type="formula">(2)</ref>, increased WBC count (2), proteinuria (2), increased hepatic enzymes (1), increased platelet count (1) and blood in urine (1). One AE of proteinuria was assessed as possibly related to study drug by the investigator.</p><p>There were no notable mean or median changes from baseline to Week 24 in any haematology, biochemistry or urinalysis parameter and no notable differences between the two treatment groups with respect to mean or median laboratory values or shifts from baseline. Clinically significant values were reported in relatively small numbers and there did not seem to be any notable difference between treatment groups in numbers with these various types of events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discontinuation due to adverse events</head><p>In COLO/DPI/02/05 AEs leading to withdrawal were reported for two patients during treatment with dry powder. Both had completed nebulised treatment in the first treatment period. These involved:</p><p> A 19-year old female with chest discomfort, severe cough, moderate dyspnoea, severe wheezing, unpleasant taste and throat irritation after the first intake of dry powder. No therapy was given and the events resolved. These AEs were considered definitely related to study medication.</p><p> A 9-year old male with moderate cough and severe gastrointestinal disorder after the first intake of dry powder, assessed as definitely related to study medication. No treatment was given and the events resolved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COLO/DPI/02/06</head><p>Of the 27 patients (7.1%) withdrawn from the study due to an AE 22 were in the Colobreathe group and 21 were withdrawn due to one or more respiratory AEs including cough, dyspnoea, haemoptysis and asthma. The timing of withdrawals was as shown below. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Post marketing experience</head><p>There are no post-marketing data on the dry powder. There are many years experience on use of nebulised colistimethate sodium. The applicant provided a satisfactory review of the safety information related to nebulised colistimethate, which suggested that most of the problems that will arise with the DPI will likely be related to immediate or early airways reactivity that should be manageable in the same way that reactions to nebulisation are managed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.1">Discussion on clinical safety</head><p>Cough, throat irritation and unpleasant taste were reported more commonly with Colobreathe compared to nebulised colistimethate sodium or TOBI. There were more withdrawals from Colobreathe than from TOBI due to AEs, almost all which involved cough, dyspnoea, haemoptysis, wheezing or asthma. However, all patients in the Phase 2 study had previously received nebulised colistimethate while all patients in the Phase 3 study had previously received TOBI. Therefore the patients were already pre-selected to a considerable extent such that they were very likely to tolerate nebulised treatments.</p><p>It appears that the majority of the problems that can be expected on initiating Colobreathe may be associated with DPI rather than the active substance per se. Based on published experience with DPI tobramycin, the picture observed with Colobreathe is not dissimilar. It also appears that the numbers that will withdraw from treatment will decrease over time. This does not necessarily mean that the side effects disappear but more likely reflects early discontinuation by those with severe side effects and increasing tolerance of less severe symptoms.</p><p>The analyses of AEs and ADRs by age suggest that the same range of side effects occurs with no marked differences in rates but the severity scoring is more variable.</p><p>From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.2">Conclusions on the clinical safety</head><p>The overall safety profile of Colobreathe is acceptable. It is likely that a similar profile would be observed when commencing inhalational therapy and also when switching from nebulised to dry powder inhalation antibacterial treatment.</p></div>

Over a concentration range 0.5 -40 mg/L the mean accuracy was reported to be 93.7% and the intra-assay precision was 3.5 -18.8%. This method measures total antibacterial activity and then infers concentrations from a standard curve. Hence it cannot differentiate the possible sub-components that might be present in test samples.The applicant attempted to assess absorption of colistimethate sodium from the respiratory tract after administration of Colobreathe in two studies in volunteers (healthy or with CF) and in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in patients with CF who were colonised with P. aeruginosa. conducted in volunteers with CF and was of similar design to DPI 98/01. Due to uncertainty in the labelling of the assay results at the laboratory, it could not be confirmed which subject each set of results represented, whether each result was from urine or serum or whether the results were pre-or post-dose. Due to some unexpectedly high concentrations (&gt; 64 mg/L) reported initially and some plate contamination with Pseudomonas species the samples were reanalysed. The majority of re-tests gave concentrations within 1-2 mg/L of those reported initially while the two samples previously reported to contain &gt; 64 mg/L were reported as &gt; 32 mg/L on repeat but it is not known if these were blood or urine.In the phase 3 study COLO DPI/02/06 1,662,500 IU colistimethate sodium dry powder twice daily was compared with TOBI (3 on/off cycles) over 24 weeks.

In a 2003 publication in which the stability of CMS and colistin under various conditions of testing were assayed using HPLC it was found that the formation of colistin in buffer corresponded well with a rapid increase in the antibacterial activity of solutions of CMS over time against Escherichia coli. Other reports have shown that the antibacterial activity of colistin against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, Enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 3-to 10-fold that of CMS. The EUCAST ECOFF for colistin for most susceptible species is 2 mg/L but the ECOFF for P. aeruginosa is 4 mg/L.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Colobreathe Colobreathe</cell></row><row><cell>Assessment report Assessment report</cell></row><row><cell>Page 26/66 Page 27/66</cell></row></table><note>Primary pharmacology Due to the mode of action, colistin is active only against certain Gram-negative aerobes and Gram- negative facultative anaerobes. Species that are generally susceptible to colistin include Citrobacter spp, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The in-vitro results may not correlate with clinical responses in the case of Acinetobacter spp. Acquired resistance in normally susceptible species is currently a potential problem in Enterobacter species and Klebsiella species. Because of the differences between colistimethate, colistin sulphate and colistin base, the interpretation of MICs is dependent on which entity has been used for testing.Colistin-resistant bacteria are characterised by phosphate groups of lipopolysaccharide that are substituted with ethanolamine or aminoarabinose. Naturally resistant Gram-negative bacteria, such as Proteus mirabilis and Burkholderia cepacia, show complete substitution of their lipid phosphate by ethanolamine or aminoarabinose. Cross resistance between colistimethate sodium and polymyxin B (the only other polymyxin that is available for clinical use) would be expected.</note></figure>

For other SOCs the total frequencies of reporting were comparable between treatment groups. Individual AEs that were reported with a considerably higher incidence in the Colobreathe group compared to the TOBI group included cough (75.4% vs. 43.5%), throat irritation (45.5% vs. 28.0%), haemoptysis (10.7% vs. 6.7%) and dysgeusia (62.6% vs. 27.5%).Between 0 and 28 days cough was reported by 58% of patients in the Colobreathe group and 20% in the TOBI group who were still on study. These reporting rates had decreased to 10% and 8% of patients in respective groups for those still in the study after 20 weeks. The nearly 8-fold drop in reporting cough cannot be explained by the numbers who had discontinued due to cough or other respiratory AEs and likely represents habituation of patients to the new treatment.Relevant to these data patients completed a symptom questionnaire. This showed that at baseline (Visit 1) symptoms reported to be associated with drug inhalation included unpleasant taste (48.1% of Colobreathe patients and 13.5% in the TOBI group), throat irritation (21.4% and 8.3%) and new cough/increase in cough (36.4% and 7.8%). By the time of the Week 24/Exit Visit (Visit 6) the proportions that assessed drug inhalation to be associated with their symptoms had decreased so that unpleasant taste was reported by 34.2% of Colobreathe patients and 5.7% of TOBI patients, throat irritation was reported by 12.8% and 5.2% and new cough/increase in cough by 24.6% and 3.6%.However, there was a slight increase from baseline to Week 24/Exit Visit in the proportion of Colobreathe patients who experienced severe unpleasant taste (from 4.3% to 7.0%).There were 20 patients treated with Colobreathe who had haemoptysis reported as a TEAE.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Colobreathe</cell></row><row><cell>Assessment report</cell></row><row><cell>Page 53/66</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

Two of the four with a medical history of haemoptysis reported it as ongoing throughout treatment as did three without a prior medical history. Most episodes of haemoptysis lasted for 6 days or less and the maximum duration of those instances that did resolve during study was 36 days. Most patients only experienced one episode of haemoptysis and no episodes resulted in withdrawal from treatment. Coadministered inhaled products which have been associated with reports of haemoptysis include dornase alpha and hypertonic saline. In the Colobreathe group 14/20 with haemoptysis on treatment received one or both of these treatments.AEs of moderate or severe intensity were reported in a higher percentage of Colobreathe patients compared to TOBI patients. In addition, drug-related AEs were reported more often in the Colobreathe group. Overall 21.9% of patients in the Colobreathe group and 3.1% in the TOBI group had at least one severe AE considered to be drug-related. This difference between groups reflected rates of respiratory AEs (16% vs. 2.1% of patients) and mainly cough (in 11.8% and 2.1% in respective groups). Severe, drug-related gastrointestinal disorders occurred in 10.2% of Colobreathe patients and 1.6% of TOBI patients but these rates were due to dysgeusia. Similar patterns were observed for AEs of moderate severity that were considered drug-related (overall in 43.3% Colobreathe and 20.2% TOBI patients) and mild severity considered drug-related (69.5% and 42% of patients in respective groups).</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Beneficial effects</head><p>Since a dramatic change in FEV1 would not be expected in such a patient population, the modest improvement in FEV1 achieved by Colobreathe when administered twice daily over 24 weeks to subjects already established on TOBI with no evidence of acute exacerbation at baseline, is considered a sufficient demonstration of efficacy. Overall, the fact that Colobreathe failed to meet the pre-defined criterion for non-inferiority vs. TOBI is not considered critical in light of the overall amount of evidence provided. In terms of respiratory function, the data show that the differences with TOBI were mostly quite small. There were some advantages noted for Colobreathe in sub-group analyses. Secondary outcome measures such as the time to acute respiratory exacerbations and mean time to first additional anti-pseudomonal treatment tended to favour Colobreathe. Also, patients generally preferred the dry powder inhalations instead of nebulisations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects</head><p>The critical questions are whether subjects satisfactorily maintained on TOBI have a clinically important deterioration in FEV1% if they switch to Colobreathe and whether adequate efficacy could be expected if Colobreathe was used instead of TOBI from the outset in subjects in need of chronic antipseudomonal therapy. Regarding the first issue the available data suggest that if there is a deterioration in FEV1% it is likely modest. Since these types of patients are usually closely followed and also would report back to their management centres if there were untoward symptoms any deterioration of significance could be expected to come to light and be dealt with quite quickly.</p><p>Regarding the second issue, there are no data to answer this question. However, it does seem that Ukrainian patients who had received only a short pre-study run-in with TOBI experienced a benefit on commencing Colobreathe.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unfavourable effects</head><p>The rate of serious adverse events were not different between treatment groups. However,</p><p>Colobreathe was associated with higher rates of AEs vs. nebulised comparators. Patients were exposed to a dry powder inhalation for the first time and the available evidence suggests that much of the difference was due to the novel effects of dry powder inhalations rather than Colobreathe per se or the active substance. The comparisons are biased against Colobreathe since patients had already been exposed to the comparative treatments and were therefore to some extent pre-selected to be tolerant.</p><p>Rates of withdrawal decreased considerably after weeks 1-8.</p></div>
