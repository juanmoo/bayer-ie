<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Introduction</head><p>Cutaneous melanoma is the most aggressive form of all skin cancers. An estimated 85294 people will be diagnosed with melanoma in 2015 in the EU, and approximately 16630 people are expected to die provide concomitant inhibition of the same pathway. It is suggested that inhibiting both MEK and BRAF simultaneously could postpone or possibly prevent the development of resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">20</ref> .</p><p>Cobimetinib is a reversible, selective, allosteric, oral inhibitor that blocks the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway by targeting the mitogen-activated extracellular signal regulated kinase (MEK) 1 and MEK 2 which results in inhibition of phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 1 and ERK 2. Therefore, cobimetinib blocks the cell proliferation induced by the MAPK pathway through inhibition of the MEK1/2 signalling node.</p><p>In the preclinical models, the combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib showed that by simultaneously targeting mutated BRAF V600 proteins and MEK proteins in melanoma cells, the combination of the two products inhibits MAPK pathway reactivation through MEK1/2, resulting in a stronger inhibition of intracellular signalling and decreased tumour cell proliferation</p><p>The applicant applied for the following indication:</p><p>Cobimetinib is indicated for use in combination with Zelboraf (vemurafenib) for the treatment of adult patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma (see section 5.1).</p><p>The final approved indication is as follows:</p><p>Cotellic is indicated for use in combination with vemurafenib for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).</p><p>Treatment with Cotellic in combination with vemurafenib should only be initiated and supervised by a qualified physician experienced in the use of anticancer medicinal products.</p><p>Before starting this treatment, patients must have BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma tumour status confirmed by a validated test (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Posology</head><p>The recommended dose of Cotellic is 60 mg (3 tablets of 20 mg) once daily.</p><p>Cotellic is taken on a 28 day cycle. Each dose consists of three 20 mg tablets (60 mg) and should be taken once daily for 21 consecutive days (Days 1 to 21-treatment period); followed by a 7-day break (Days 22 to 28-treatment break). Each subsequent Cotellic treatment cycle should start after the 7day treatment break has elapsed (SmPC section 4.2).</p><p>For information on the posology of vemurafenib, please refer to its SmPC.</p><p>Treatment with Cotellic should continue until the patient no longer derives benefit or until the development of unacceptable toxicity. If a dose is missed, it can be taken up to 12 hours prior to the next dose to maintain the once-daily regimen. In case of vomiting after administration of Cotellic, the patient should not take an additional dose on that day and treatment should be continued as prescribed the following day (SmPC section 4.2).</p><p>Cotellic is for oral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole with water. They can be taken with or without food (SmPC section 4.2).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Introduction</head><p>The finished product is presented as a film-coated tablet containing cobimetinib hemifumarate equivalent to 20 mg cobimetinib as active substance.</p><p>Other ingredients are for tablet core: lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose (E460), croscarmellose sodium (E468), magnesium stearate (E470b) and for film coating: polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide (E171), macrogol 3350, talc (E553b).</p><p>The product is available in transparent PVC/PVDC blisters containing 21 tablets as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Active Substance</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General information</head><p>The chemical name of cobimetinib hemifumarate is (S)-[3,4-difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4iodophenylamino)phenyl] [3-hydroxy-3-(piperidin-2-yl)azetidin-1-yl]methanone hemifumarate and it has the following structure:</p><p>The active substance is a non-hygroscopic white to off-white solid. The solubility is high over the pH range 1 to 7.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacture, characterisation and process controls</head><p>The active substance is sourced from one supplier involving two manufacturing sites.</p><p>The active substance is synthesized in seven steps with a telescoped part of five non-isolated steps.</p><p>The last step is salt formation. An optional re-working procedure is described and is considered acceptable. The synthesis uses commercially available well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. The active substance has one chiral centre which has the (S)-configuration.</p><p>Enantiomeric purity is controlled by the manufacturing process and starting material specifications. In addition enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC control in the active substance specifications. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.</p><p>The same synthetic route has been used throughout the development from toxicological studies to the commercial batches. Changes introduced during development of active substance manufacturing process have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. The development of the manufacturing process is based on the combination of a traditional and enhanced approach (ICHQ11, ICHQ8, ICHQ9).</p><p>The active substance Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) and Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) are described.</p><p>Moreover, critical material attributes have been defined for starting material and intermediates.</p><p>The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of conventional univariate studies and elements of QbD such as risk assessment, design of experiment (DoE) studies. Based on these studies, proven acceptable ranges (PARs) have been defined for several steps of the manufacturing process of the active substance. The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs. Confirmation is provided that no design space is claimed.</p><p>The chemical structure of cobimetinib is confirmed by using elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy ( 1 H, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">13</ref> C &amp; 13 C solid-state), mass spectrometry, single crystal X-ray diffraction and UV spectroscopy. Polymorphism has been observed for the active substance. Cobimetinib exists in two solid forms. The same polymorphic form is consistently produced by the manufacturing process.</p><p>Polymorphic form of the active substance is also controlled in the active substance specifications. A comprehensive list of impurities that may arise from the synthesis (starting materials, solvents, reagents, intermediates, by-products, genotoxic impurities) or from degradation is discussed. The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances.</p><p>The active substance is packaged in closed, double low-density polyethylene bags within a closed steel drum. The low-density polyethylene bags comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specification</head><p>The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), fumaric acid content (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), enantiomeric content (HPLC), genotoxic impurities (GC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), heavy metals (USP), palladium (USP), particle size distribution (laser diffraction), residue on ignition (USP) and polymorphic form (X-ray powder diffraction).</p><p>The control strategy for genotoxic impurities was discussed in a recent scientific advice, EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/210707/2014, and the applicant has followed the advice. The control strategy is thus considered acceptable.</p><p>The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.</p><p>Batch analysis data on ten pilot scale batches of active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability</head><p>Stability data were provided on five batches of active substance (three primary stability batches, including one production scale batch, and two supportive stability batches) manufactured by the proposed manufacturer according to earlier development manufacturing process. The differences between the manufacturing process for the three primary stability batches and that of the commercial manufacturing process are considered not to be relevant in terms of potential impact on the stability profile. Stability batches were stored in the intended commercial package for up 24 to months under long term conditions at 30 °C / 75% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines.</p><p>The following parameters were tested: appearance; water content; assay; impurities; enantiomeric purity; particle size; polymorphic form. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and are stability indicating. All tested parameters were within the specifications.</p><p>Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Forced degradation studies have also been performed. Results demonstrate that the active substance in the solid state is not sensitive to light, elevated temperature or humidity.</p><p>The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 30 months below 30 °C in the proposed container.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Finished Medicinal Product</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description of the product and pharmaceutical development</head><p>The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop an immediate-release film-coated tablet containing cobimetinib.</p><p>The composition of the finished product is provided.</p><p>The pharmaceutical development includes elements of science and risk-based approaches such as described in ICH Q8(R2) and ICH Q9.</p><p>A QTPP was established which forms the basis for the finished product development. CQAs were identified. Finished product CQAs are appearance, cobimetinib content, degradation products, uniformity of dosage units, dissolution and microbial limits.</p><p>The hemifumarate salt of cobimetinib was selected since it exists in only one crystalline form with a high melting point and low hygroscopicity. Conversion to the amorphous state during tablet production is very unlikely due to the high melting point.</p><p>Appropriate active substance particle size distribution criteria are defined to ensure satisfactory finished product processability and performance.</p><p>A number of standard excipients were examined for their compatibility with the active substance by testing binary mixtures of active substance and excipient in accelerated/stressed stability studies.</p><p>Suitable excipients were further investigated for compatibility between excipients themselves. All excipients selected are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph.</p><p>Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. The amount of each excipient is justified as well.</p><p>An assessment of the benefits of dry and wet granulation was made initially and due to the simplicity of the process (reduced number of unit operations), dry granulation by roller compaction was chosen for development.</p><p>The formulation development used risk assessment and DoE studies to find an appropriate phase III and commercial formulation.</p><p>Two tablet formulations have been used during clinical development. The proposed commercial formulation was already used for phase III studies. Based on bioequivalence studies against the phase I formulation bridging between the prototype and the commercial tablet can be accepted.</p><p>The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of conventional univariate studies and elements of QbD such as risk assessment and DoE studies. A risk analysis was performed using the failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) method in order to define critical process steps and process parameters that may have an influence on the finished product quality attributes. The critical process parameters have been adequately identified.</p><p>Description of the development of the dissolution method is provided. The discriminatory power of the dissolution method developed for quality control has been demonstrated. However, based on the high All parameters remained within specification during the stability testing at all storage conditions. No significant changes have been observed.</p><p>In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. Results demonstrated that the finished product is not light sensitive.</p><p>Based on available stability data, the shelf-life of 24 months with no special storage conditions as stated in the SmPC is acceptable.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4.">Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects</head><p>The finished product is presented as a film-coated tablet containing the new active substance cobimetinib hemifumarate. Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and the finished product and their manufacturing process. Proven acceptable ranges have been defined for several steps of the active substance manufacture and the medicinal product manufacture. However, no design spaces were claimed. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.5.">Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects</head><p>The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on TSE safety.</p></div>

The results are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> and show that the combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib was able to overcome the resistance observed with either of the compounds alone. The pharmacodynamic and phenotypic effects of cobimetinib and vemurafenib were tested in A375 BRAF V600E melanoma cell lines ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.6.">Discussion on non-clinical aspects</head><p>Cobimetinib has demonstrated selectivity for MEK1/2 in in vitro and in vivo models. Cobimetinib inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and the proliferation and induction of apoptosis in BRAFmutant melanoma cell lines. This was also shown in cell lines with acquired resistance to vemurafenib.</p><p>Therefore, the combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib appears to have a more profound effect on inhibiting the MAPK pathway and tumour growth in vivo than either compound alone.</p><p>Pharmacology and toxicology studies were carried out with cobimetinib HCL or hemifumarate salts by the oral route of administration as this is the proposed therapeutic route in humans. The animal species and strains used in these investigations are considered adequate based on the similarities in the pharmacokinetic and metabolic handling of cobimetinib between the selected species and human.</p><p>Cobimetinib was characterized by low to moderate CL and moderate to high volumes of distribution in animals. Cobimetinib was well absorbed in rat and dog. Of the cobimetinib-related radioactivity in plasma of rat and dog the major circulating exposure was from unchanged cobimetinib. The metabolism of cobimetinib was extensive with less than 10% of the dose excreted as unchanged cobimetinib in urine, feces, or bile. Biliary excretion of cobimetinib-related metabolites into feces was the major pathway for cobimetinib elimination. Toxicity in the GI tract lead to decreased food consumption and body weight, emesis, mucoid discoloured faeces and hypoactivity. Thus, diarrhoea has been included as an important identified risk in the RMP and will be managed through routine pharmacovigilance. The toxicokinetic data from the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed under sub-clinical exposure in animals dosed for the full length of the study in order to be able to acquire safety for the required 4-week and 13-week studies. This is considered acceptable considering the high toxicity and mortality rate observed at clinical exposure although very little information on the toxicity of cobimetinib after long-term treatment can be derived from these studies. As a consequence, the NOEAL in the pivotal toxicity studies at sub-clinical exposures were 0.05/0.15 times the clinical exposure in the rat 4 week and 13</p><p>week studies, respectively. In dog the same exposures were 1/0.1 times the clinical exposure in the 4</p><p>week and 13 week studies, respectively. In a repeat dose toxicity study in juvenile rats, cobimetinib systemic exposures were 2 to 11 fold higher on post-natal day 10 than on post-natal day 38 when exposures were similar to those in adult rats. In juvenile rats, cobimetinib administration resulted in similar changes as seen in the pivotal toxicity studies in adults, including reversible degenerative changes in the thymus and liver, decreased spleen and thyroid/parathyroid weights, increased phosphorus, bilirubin and red cell mass and decreased triglycerides. Mortality occurred in juvenile animals at a dose (3 mg/kg) which did not lead to mortalities in adult animals (SmPC section 5.3)</p><p>Based on the in vitro data hERG assay, cobimetinib appeared to increase the potency of vemurafenib.</p><p>However, the in vivo ECG study in dogs with cobimetinib did not show any effect. It is noteworthy that the study was undertaken at lower than clinical exposures and is therefore of limited value.</p><p>Cardiovascular safety of cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib has not been evaluated in vivo.</p><p>In vitro, cobimetinib produced moderate hERG ion channel inhibition (IC 50 ꞊ 0.5 µM [266 ng/mL]),</p><p>which is approximately 18 fold higher than peak plasma concentrations (C max ) at the 60 mg to be Cobimetinib did not induce local toxicity at the injection site in the rat study. However, clinical data show that many patients experience skin toxicities, especially phototoxicity. Cobimetinib treated UVexposed rats did not show signs of increased skin/eye toxicity compared to vehicle treated animals. The batches used during pivotal non-clinical toxicity studies show a high degree of purity and no impurity were above the 0.15% qualification level. All specified impurities are set below the 0.15% qualification level.</p><p>Cobimetinib is not a PBT substance and is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.</p><p>Assessment report EMA/685908/2015 Page 37/139</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metabolism</head><p>The metabolism of cobimetinib by human liver microsomes (HLM) was NADPH dependent. The metabolism was CYP450 mediated since incubation with HLM pre-treated with ABT (non-selective CYP450 inhibitor) resulted in no metabolism of cobimetinib i.e. 101% of the compound remained unchanged compared to 45% when incubated with non-ABT-pre-treated HLM.</p><p>HLM incubations with cobimetinib in the presence and absence of CYP inhibitors showed that cobimetinib appeared to be metabolised mainly via CYP3A4/5.</p><p>Following a single oral dose of 14C-labelled cobimetinib, the compound was extensively metabolised with about 2 and 7% of the dose excreted as parent compound in urine and faeces, respectively. In total, approximately 75% of the administered dose was excreted in faeces and about 18% in the urine.</p><p>More than 20 metabolites were identified in faeces, of which four individually accounted for 5-10% of the dose given. Three major metabolites, with plasma levels comparable to the exposure of the parent compound, were identified following a single oral 14C-labelled dose of cobimetinib. More than 20% of the radioactivity in plasma remained unextractable, with the percentage unextracted increasing with time. However, no active metabolites have been identified in circulation and two of the 3 circulating metabolites were identified as phase-2 metabolites.</p></div>

This was confirmed by an in vivo DDI study where the total exposure of cobimetinib increased about 7-fold when co-administered with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor. This 7-fold increase in exposure suggests that CYP3A metabolism represents 85% of the total elimination. CYP3A4</p><p>and CYP3A5 were shown to be involved in the metabolism with about 10% and 65% of cobimetinib remaining, respectively, after 60-min incubations. Following incubations with CYP2D6 and 2C19, 80</p><p>and 85% of cobimetinib remained, respectively, while after incubations with the others &gt;95%</p><p>remained.</p><p>UGT2B7 was identified as involved in the formation of one of the major metabolites M15.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanism of action</head><p>Cobimetinib is an orally available small molecule and selective allosteric inhibitor of the mitogen- Cobimetinib has shown high inhibitory potency in biochemical and cell based assays, as well as broad anti-tumour activity in vivo in xenograft tumour models, including those that are mutated for BRAF and KRAS. Of note, cobimetinib has a specific mechanism of binding and inhibition of MEK1/2 21 , which is suggested to be more effective for targeting BRAFV600-mediated activation of MEK, and less effective to mitigate activation of MEK by other mechanisms.</p><p>By simultaneously targeting BRAF and MEK the combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib results in stronger inhibition of ERK signalling, greater tumour cell apoptosis and enhanced tumour responses in pre-clinical models than vemurafenib alone.</p><p>As shown in the efficacy sections below, reversal of pre-formed resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy only occurred in a minority of cases, however. Proposed mechanisms for this finding are e.g. reactivation or re-configuration of MAPK pathway, activation of parallel signalling pathways and/or genomic diversification after disease progression on BRAF inhibitor. These mechanisms are consistent with currently known main mechanisms of resistance to BRAFi therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">25</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacodynamic effects on molecular biomarkers</head><p>In 6 patients, the PD effects of cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib were assessed at baseline and on Cycle 1 Day 14 of combination therapy (steady-state of cobimetinib) based on paired tumour biopsies samples from both vemurafenib-PD and BRAFi-naive patients and showed reduction in pERK and pS6 levels and reduction in the number of Ki-67 positive tumour nuclei ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 5</ref>).  In the phase Ib study NO25395, the PD effect of cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib was assessed by measuring changes in FDG uptake as characterized by the lean body mass corrected (LBM) maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) measurement (see <ref type="table">Table below</ref>).</p><p>On average, disease measured at baseline was more FDG-avid in vemurafenib-PD patients compared</p><p>to BRAFi-naive patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>QTc Assessment</head><p>The effects on QTc interval were assessed following administration of cobimetinib as monotherapy or in combination with vemurafenib in Study MEK4592g (in patients with advanced solid tumours) and in Study NO25395 (in patients with advanced BRAF V600-mutated melanoma), respectively. No dedicated thorough QTc study has been conducted. A summary of the data is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 31</ref>.</p><p>The number of patients with grade ≥3 QTc prolongation was 3 out of 129 safety evaluable subjects in Study NO25395 and 1 vemurafenib-PD patient and 2 BRAFi-naive patients. Cobimetinib is 94.8% bound to human plasma proteins in vitro. No preferential binding to human red blood cells was observed (blood to plasma ratio 0.93).</p><p>The volume of distribution was 1050 L in healthy subjects given an intravenous dose of 2 mg. The apparent volume of distribution was 806 L in cancer patients based on population pharmacokinetic analysis.</p><p>Cobimetinib and its metabolites were characterised in a mass balance study in healthy subjects. On average, 94% of the dose was recovered within 17 days. Cobimetinib was extensively metabolised and eliminated in faeces. Following intravenous administration of a 2 mg dose of cobimetinib, the mean plasma clearance (CL) was 10.7 L/hr. The mean apparent CL following oral dosing of 60 mg in cancer patients was 13.8 L/hr.</p><p>The mean elimination half-life following oral dosing of cobimetinib was 43.6 hours (range: 23.1 to 69.6 hours). Therefore, it may take up to 2 weeks following treatment cessation for cobimetinib to be completely removed from systemic circulation (SmPC section 5.2).</p><p>Following a single oral dose of 14C-labelled cobimetinib, cobimetinib was extensively metabolised with about 2 and 7% of dose excreted as parent compound in the urine and faeces, respectively. About 75% of dose administered was excreted in faeces.. Three metabolites were identified in plasma with individual plasma levels of &gt;10% of total radioactivity at some time-points up to 48h post dose.</p><p>Cobimetinib is eliminated primarily via metabolism in the liver. Oxidation by CYP3A and glucuronidation by UGT2B7 appear to be the major pathways of cobimetinib metabolism. Cobimetinib is the predominant moiety in plasma. No oxidative metabolites greater than 10% of total circulating radioactivity or human specific metabolites were observed in plasma. Unchanged medicinal product in faeces and urine accounted for 6.6% and 1.6% of the administered dose, respectively, indicating that cobimetinib is primarily metabolised with minimal renal elimination (SmPC section 5.2). Serious hepatotoxicity has been added as an important potential risk. Safety in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment has been included as missing information in the RMP. The risk will be monitored through dose reduction and treatment discontinuation guidance for hepatic impairment and liver laboratory abnormalities as described in the SmPC Section 4.2 (Posology and method of administration to be significantly reduced when co-administered with moderate to strong CYP3A inducers, patient's efficacy may be compromised..</p></div>

In the case of stable disease, measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry (randomisation) at a minimum interval not less than 6 weeks. Evaluable patients who did not meet these criteria were considered non-responders; this includes patients who never received study treatment and treated patients for whom post-baseline tumour assessment was not performed.

In addition there was 1 patient with ocular melanoma and 1 with choroidal mixed-type melanoma, categorised as tumour type "other".

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.3.">Discussion on clinical efficacy Design and conduct of clinical studies</head><p>The applicant submitted a pivotal randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial In general, the pivotal study was well conducted, the treatment arms were well balanced and there were no major protocol deviations that affected the robustness of the data. A routine GCP inspection found critical findings with regard to the cleaning of data affecting ORR data in one of the inspected sites. The inspection report concluded that the deviations are generally not considered to be of concern in the context of the marketing authorisation application. Even the deviations concerning the efficacy parameters seem to have not affected the primary efficacy parameter Progression Free Survival.</p><p>The pivotal study compared two treatment arms, a vemurafenib plus cobimetinib arm versus vemurafenib plus placebo and therefore did not contain a third arm of cobimetinib plus placebo. The CHMP expressed some concern over the lack of a cobimetinib only treatment arm. It was considered that the clinical efficacy of cobimetinib monotherapy had not been thoroughly investigated in melanoma patients as only 45 patients with different types of cancer were treated with the same dose/schedule as intended for melanoma patients. The lack of information on the efficacy of cobimetinib monotherapy results in a situation where the efficacy contribution of each of the components in the combination therapy cannot be formally assessed and as a result it is not known whether the added toxicity of vemurafenib could have been avoided. However, there is support from non-clinical data for a stronger effect of combination therapy in BRAF sensitive xenograft tumours. In addition, cross-study comparison of published phase 3 monotherapy data of the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib 5 and dabrafenib <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">10</ref> and MEK inhibitor trametinib 9 provided clinical support for a superior efficacy of the combination therapy over the MEK or BRAF inhibitor monotherapy. Therefore, the lack of a cobimetinib only treatment arm was considered acceptable.</p><p>The dose schedule for the pivotal study is considered justified based on the data from the single arm study MEK4592g study and NO25395 study. In study NO25395 the evaluation of a 14/14 schedule showed tumour regrowth in some patients during off-drug period whereas a 21/7 schedule showed no tumour regrowth during the off-drug period. Therefore, the current posology is considered acceptable.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IRF-assessed PFS (not updated)</head><p>The HR for IRF-assessed PFS (with stratifications) was 0.60 (95%CI 0.45, 0.79; log-rank; p=0.0003; stratified analysis) in favour of the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm. The PFS improvement when assessed by the IRF was consistent with investigator assessment. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall survival (OS)</head><p>Due to the low overall event rate of 85/495 = 17%, an updated OS analysis was requested, which was performed at an event rate of 188/495 = 38%. This is still considered immature. In the planned interim analysis of OS HR=0.645 (stratified) and 0.62 (unstratified), in favour of the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm.</p><p>In the updated analysis, the OS analysis was consistent: 0.650 (stratified) with a median OS of 17 months in the vemurafenib plus placebo arm, but had not yet been reached for the combination arm.</p><p>It was noted that the estimate for the lower 95% interval was 5 months apart in the two treatment arms. Thus, these preliminary results from OS analysis are considered supportive of the primary efficacy analysis, investigator-assessed PFS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective response rate (ORR)</head><p>In the planned primary analysis based on investigator assessments, the difference in confirmed ORR was 67.6% versus 44.8% for patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib vs. patients treated with vemurafenib and placebo (p &lt; 0.0001 by chi-square with Schouten correction). In the IRF analysis of ORR, a total of 56.3% of patients in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm attained an objective response compared to 40.7% of patients in the vemurafenib plus placebo arm.</p><p>The updated analysis showed a confirmed ORR of 69.6% (95% CI: 63.5%, 75.3%) versus 50.0% (95% CI: 43.6%, 56.4%), respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient-reported outcomes (PROs)</head><p>Global health status/health-related quality of life (HRQoL), symptom severity, and functional interference of symptoms by patient report were measured for each treatment arm using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Completion rates were consistently high among all cycles for both treatment arms (≥ 88%). Patients in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm experienced either clinically meaningful improvement or marginal improvement in insomnia in time points in 4 treatment cycles, and clinically meaningful worsening of diarrhoea from baseline at Day 15 in the two first treatment cycles. For global health status, as well as most functioning and symptom scales, the difference in proportion of responders was small, indicating similarity in HRQoL between the two treatment arms.</p><p>Larger differences were seen for insomnia and social functioning, and to a lesser extent, pain and fatigue; all favoured the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of primary vs. updated analyses</head><p>The primary analysis of PFS and ORR showed statistically significant differences between arms (p&lt; 0.0001 for both). The results in the updated analyses were consistent with the primary analyses, with similar or narrower confidence intervals: PFS HR 0.51 and 0.58, OS HR 0.65 and 0.65, (95% CI: 0.49-0.87 for the updated analysis), and difference in ORR 23% and 20%, in the earlier and updated analyses, respectively. It is noted that the CIs for ORR in the two study arms are not overlapping.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subgroup analyses</head><p>Subgroup analyses were consistent with the overall results, with nearly all HR point estimates below 1.0 and near the overall HR of 0.51. For the two subgroups with very few subjects, Non-white or unknown race (n=33) and Prior treatment of brain metastasis (n=3), the HR point estimates were &gt;1.0 with wide confidence intervals. Thus, efficacy in these subgroups is considered unknown.</p><p>Some differences between subgroups were noted and the relative efficacy appears generally higher in some subgroups of poorer prognosis (e.g. disease stage M1c, and performance status ECOG 1) compared with their better prognosis counterparts. One of the main causes of mortality in melanoma patients is the development of brain metastases. In the phase 3 study, only 3 patients with brain metastases were treated (2 in combination group, 1 in control group). Therefore, efficacy of combination therapy in treatment of brain metastases is not established. Therefore, the safety and long-term efficacy in patients with brain (CNS) involvement has been included in the RMP as missing December 2019.</p></div>

This was considered tolerable and selected as the recommended Phase II/III dose.</p><p>In patients that had not been previously treated with vemurafenib (BRAFi-naïve patients) (all doses, n꞊63), the confirmed objective response rate was 87%, including a complete response in 10% of patients.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other V600 mutation subtypes</head><p>With regard to other, rarer, V600 subtypes, some support of activity of vemurafenib/cobimetinib therapy is provided by preclinical data. Thus, data from biochemical assays, in silico protein structure modelling, and in vitro studies on melanoma cell lines have been presented by the Applicant that support the activity of vemurafenib monotherapy in V600 subtypes such as R, D, G, M as well as other BRAF mutations. In vitro data showing a similar sensitivity of BRAF V600E and V600D mutated melanoma cell lines to single-agent cobimetinib is also available (not shown).</p><p>Clinical support for activity of BRAFi with single-agent vemurafenib in patients with non-E, non-K V600 mutated tumours comes from an ongoing single-arm phase II study ML27763 investigating efficacy in  <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">29</ref> and McArthur et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">8</ref> .

In addition, for all tested cut-offs combination therapy with cobimetinib + vemurafenib was consistently associated with higher PFS than vemurafenib + placebo.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General comments</head><p>The CHMP highlighted that in patients that have progressed on BRAF inhibitor therapy, there was the possibility of a loss of chance of patients receiving potentially other treatment options that could provide a better efficacy for this line of therapy. There was the concern that awaiting progression on BRAFi + MEKi after failure on BRAFi, even if only for a few months, could therefore be detrimental to the possibility of response on subsequent therapies such as immunotherapy. The available evidence from the literature suggests that patients that have progressed on BRAF inhibitor have a reactivated MAPK pathway and that their tumours may still respond to downstream targeting of MEK. As a consequence, patients may still derive benefit from further downstream targeting with a MEK inhibitor.</p><p>There were no clinical or biological markers that could be identified based on the limited data available from biological samples to identify patients with high likelihood of response. Therefore, the CHMP did not restrict the indication to a BRAF inhibitor-naive patient population. The indication includes patients that have progressed on BRAF inhibitor treatment, with a reference to a warning in section 4.4 that patients that have progressed on BRAF inhibitor will derive lower efficacy and that other treatment options could be considered for this patient population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.4.">Conclusions on the clinical efficacy</head><p>The overall efficacy results in the pivotal Phase III study GO28141/coBRIM were consistent across all outcome parameters and subgroups analysed. The PFS results were statistically significant and clinically relevant. The results of the Phase III study GO28141/coBRIM showed a clinically relevant efficacy for the combination treatment of cobimetinib and vemurafenib in terms of PFS and ORR in BRAF naive patients and in patients that progressed with BRAF inhibitor therapy. The OS results support the clinical benefit observed in melanoma patients although the magnitude of the treatment effect is yet unknown as the data is still considered immature. As a follow up, the CHMP would recommend to the applicant to submit the results of the final OS analysis of study GO28141. The supportive study NO25395 also showed a clinically relevant efficacy in BRAFi-naive patients as well as for patients whom had previously progressed on vemurafenib (BRAFi-PD), acknowledging that data in this patient population is limited and that the clinical benefit observed in the study indicated that it was lower in these patients. Therefore, other treatment options should be considered before treatment with the combination in this prior BRAF inhibitor treated population. been included as missing information and CHMP has requested, as part of the PIP, the submission of the results from two paediatric studies in patients 6 months to 18 years of age (GO29665).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse events</head><p>The common AEs regardless of relationship to study drug at the original cut-off (09 May 2014) and at the updated cut-off (19 September 2014) are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 56</ref>. The causal relationship of a reported adverse event to cobimetinib was based on the comparative incidence of adverse events in patients treated with cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib (active arm) and vemurafenib plus placebo (control arm). The criteria by which cobimetinib ADRs were defined are adverse events (all grades) that occurred with a ≥ 5% incidence over the control arm or Grades 3-4 adverse events with an incidence of ≥ 2% over the control arm were assessed as causally related with cobimetinib. Thus, these are considered ADRs for the product. Adverse events that did not meet the ADR criteria of a ≥ 5% incidence over the control arm for all Grades or Grades 3-4 adverse events with an incidence of ≥ 2% over the control arm, or occurred at the same or lower frequency in the active arm compared to the control arm (e.g., fatigue, cough, dysgeusia, headache, and arthralgia) were not considered as causally related to cobimetinib. Amongst all adverse events reported in study GO28141, causality was not assessed for both cobimetinib and vemurafenib as a combination together because of the lack of a pure placebo treatment arm, and therefore no ADRs are considered as combination ADRs. The exception to the above criteria were events of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC), keratoacanthomas and other hyperkeratotic skin lesions, which are well-recognised toxicities associated with BRAF inhibitors, including vemurafenib and, therefore, were considered ADRs with cobimetinib. The list of ADRs for cobimetinib treatment is displayed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 57</ref>.  For BRAFi-naïve patients in the phase 1b NO25395 study, the most common AEs were diarrhoea as seen in 82%, nausea in 57%, vomiting in 43%, fatigue in 70%, pyrexia in 43%, arthralgia in 48%.</p><p>In the cobimetinib monotherapy study MEK4592g, the most frequent AEs among all subjects were diarrhoea (67.0%), fatigue (50.4%), rash (49.6%), nausea, vomiting (33.9% each), oedema peripheral (28.7%), abdominal pain (24%) and constipation (21%).</p><p>A comparison of the Adverse Events by intensity for studies GO28141 and NO25395 are summarized in  The most common Grade ≥ 3 AEs reported at a higher frequency (≥ 2% difference) in patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib than in patients treated with placebo plus vemurafenib are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 59</ref>. </p></div>

Review of photosensitivity events included the preferred terms of photosensitivity reaction, solar dermatitis, and sunburn. These events were reported, respectively, in 6 patients (2.4%), 1 patient (0.4%), and 1 patient (0.4%). The overall pattern of Grade ≥ 3 photosensitivity events in the safety update is consistent with data originally reported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade ≥ 2 reduction in LVEF</head><p>In Study GO28141, all reported AEs of reduction in LVEF were Grade 2 or Grade 3. The frequency of Grade ≥ 2 reduction in LVEF events was higher in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm (17 <ref type="bibr">[6.7%]</ref> patients) than in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm (7 [2.9%] patients).</p><p>As a result of these AEs in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm, 2 patients discontinued cobimetinib, As a result of the AEs in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm, 2 patients discontinued from placebo, 2 had dose interruptions of placebo, 1 had a dose reduction of placebo, and 1 had a dose interruption of vemurafenib.

One patient from each study arm discontinued both study drugs because of Grade ≥ 3 QTc prolongation. Additionally, two events of syncope and one report of cardiac arrest were reported in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm, and 1 report of syncope was reported in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm. None of the patients with reports of syncope or Grade 5 cardiac arrest had concurrent AEs of QTc prolongation reported. 0.4% of patients in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm and 1.3% in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm had events reported with the specific preferred term "electrocardiogram QT prolonged".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Any Cutaneous Malignancy</head><p>At the original cut-off date (09 May 2014), all cutaneous primary malignancy events in Study GO28141</p><p>were reported as Grade 3, as directed in the study protocol. The incidence of any cutaneous primary malignancy was lower in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm (8.3%) than in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm (19.7%). The most common cutaneous malignancies observed were squamous cell carcinoma of skin and keratoacanthoma, reported at lower frequencies among patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib (2.8% and 0.8%, respectively) than among patients treated with placebo plus vemurafenib (11.3% and 8.4%, respectively). No patients in either treatment arm discontinued the study or cobimetinib or vemurafenib treatment due to a cutaneous malignancy adverse event. As of the clinical cut-off date for the safety update, time to first incidence of cuSCC or KA events continued to be delayed in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm compared with the placebo plus vemurafenib arm, with medians of 4.3 months vs. 1.9 months, respectively, compared with 3.3 vs. 1.8 months. In Study GO28141, the frequency of basal cell carcinoma BCC remained higher in patients in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm than in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm (4.5% vs. 2.4%).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.2.">Conclusions on the clinical safety</head><p>The safety assessment of cobimetinib in metastatic melanoma rests mainly upon clinical data on 376 patients subjected to combined treatment with vemurafenib and cobimetinib. Common side effects encountered in the studies are e.g. diarrhoea, rash, nausea/vomiting, fatigue, arthralgia, pyrexia, photosensitivity reactions. Elevations of laboratory parameters e.g. LFT (ALT, AST, GGT, ALP) and</p><p>blood creatine phosphokinase are also very often seen. While many of these occur frequently during monotherapy with vemurafenib, the net effect of the addition of cobimetinib varies between an increase (e.g. for diarrhoea, nausea, and photosensitivity reactions) and a decrease in frequency (e.g. for arthralgia, hyperkeratosis, and alopecia). In a few cases, e.g. ocular events, grade ≥3 photosensitivity reactions, elevation in blood creatine phosphokinase, the AE seems preferentially associated with cobimetinib.</p><p>There appears to be an increased incidence of ADRs The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefits</head><p>The pivotal study for the present application is for all practical purposes the randomised, placebocontrolled Phase III trial GO28141, "coBRIM". The final CSR from this study was submitted on Day 121. Updated efficacy and safety analyses were also provided in responses to questions; no p-values were provided due to the exploratory nature of these analyses.</p><p>Cobimetinib is an orally available and selective small molecule inhibitor of the mitogen-activated could therefore potentially address major mechanisms of resistance. However, the results indicate that while the occurrence of vemurafenib resistance is significantly delayed by the upfront addition of cobimetinib, preformed vemurafenib-resistance can in most cases not be overcome by the subsequent addition of cobimetinib.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Beneficial effects</head><p>The Phase III study GO28141/coBRIM was a I:I-randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of vemurafenib plus placebo vs. vemurafenib plus cobimetinib in BRAF V600-mutation positive patients with unresectable melanoma previously untreated for locally advanced or metastatic disease. The study met its primary endpoint with a hazard ratio (HR) for investigator-based PFS (with stratifications) of 0.51 (95% CI 0.39, 0.68; log-rank p&lt;0.0001) in favour of the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm. An updated PFS analysis performed at an event rate of 65% and with data cut-off 8 months after the primary analysis showed a HR= 0.58 (95% CI: 0:46; 0.72), with a difference in medians PFS across treatment arms of 5.0 months (12.25 vs. 7.2 months) in favour of the combination therapy.</p><p>The planned interim analysis showed OS HR=0.645 (stratified analysis, p=0.05) and 0.62 (unstratified analysis, p=0.03) in favour of the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm. The event rate at the time of the pre-planned interim analysis was 17%. However, the results did not cross the pre-specified boundary for statistical significance. A consistent HR was observed in the updated OS analysis: 0.650 (stratified), with narrower confidence intervals than in the primary analysis. This analysis was performed at an event rate of 38%, and is considered supportive but still immature at this stage.</p><p>The confirmed ORR was 69.6% (95% CI: 63.5%, 75.3%) versus 50.0% (95% CI: 43.6%, 56.4%), Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) indicated no detrimental impact by cobimetinib plus vemurafenib treatment on global health status/health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Generally numerically higher responder rates were observed for cobimetinib plus vemurafenib compared with placebo plus vemurafenib, but differences were generally small, indicating similarity in HRQoL between the two treatment arms.</p><p>Subgroup analyses were consistent with the overall results, with nearly all HR point estimates below 1.0 and near the overall HR of 0.51.</p><p>In the Phase 1b study NO25395/BRIM7 of cobimetinib + vemurafenib, the median follow-up time was 9.5 months. In the BRAFi-naïve patient group (n꞊63), the (confirmed) objective response rate was 87%, including a complete response in 10% of patients. The median duration of response was 12.5</p><p>months. The objective response rate in the vemurafenib-progressed patients was 15% (95% CI: 7.5, 25.5); with median duration of response in responding patients at 6.7 months whereas for BRAFi-naive patients, ORR was 84.6% (95%CI: 69.9, 93.1) with a median duration of response of 11.3 months.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects</head><p>In the phase III study GO28141/coBRIM, the efficacy of cobimetinib was primarily investigated in patients that were naïve to BRAF inhibitor treatment. Therefore, most of the data in patients previously Assessment report EMA/685908/2015 Page 134/139 treated with BRAF inhibitors is derived from the phase 1b study NO25395/BRIM7, where half of the patients enrolled had progressed after vemurafenib treatment. The activity of the cobimetinib + vemurafenib combination in patients who had progressed on prior vemurafenib therapy was low, with ORR around 15% overall (n=66), and 26% in patients receiving the intended dose (n=27). Thus, it appears that the combination treatment did not overcome the resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy as the response was low. Therefore, a warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC that there is limited data in patients that have progressed following BRAF inhibitor therapy and that other treatment options should be considered before treatment with the combination in this prior BRAF inhibitor treated population. The sequence of treatments following progression on a BRAF inhibitor therapy has not been established.</p><p>A key exclusion criterion for study GO28141 was the exclusion of patients with active CNS metastasis.</p><p>Patients with treated CNS lesions and no evidence of progression could be included. As a result, only 3 patients with CNS lesions were treated (2 in combination group, 1 in control group). A warning that the efficacy and safety of combination therapy in the treatment of brain metastases has not been studied and that the intracranial activity of cobimetinib is currently unknown has been included in section 4.4.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects</head><p>There were several missing information that have been included as part of the RMP.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit-risk balance</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects</head><p>The clinical benefit of cobimetinib plus vemurafenib has been demonstrated with a prolongation of PFS of approximately 5 months in locally advanced or metastatic malignant melanoma. This is considered clinically relevant for the patient. Tumour responses (70% for combination therapy vs. 50% for vemurafenib monotherapy) and the duration of response, median 12.5-13 months in BRAF inhibitornaïve patients (in both the phase III and the Phase 1b study) and 6.7 months in the smaller fraction of BRAFi-progressed patients who responded (in the Phase 1b study), were also considered of clinical importance.</p><p>The safety of cobimetinib plus vemurafenib is considered acceptable and manageable. In addition, the percentage of patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) and keratoacanthoma appeared to be lower than that observed with vemurafenib treatment. The risk and the actual occurrence of cuSCC is an important additive burden for patients. Therefore the decreased incidence of such squamous cell carcinoma is considered a benefit of the combination therapy.</p><p>Assessment report EMA/685908/2015 Page 136/139</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit-risk balance</head><p>The CHMP considers that the benefits of cobimetinib and vemurafenib combination therapy in adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation outweigh the risks.</p><p>Therefore, the CHMP considers that the benefit risk balance is positive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion on the benefit-risk balance</head><p>The indication for the combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib is supported by non-clinical and clinical data that suggest that targeting the MAPK kinase pathway at two separate levels is expected to improve efficacy. The main pivotal study, GO28141, has demonstrated a clinically relevant improvement in PFS and ORR, with supportive evidence from OS analysis. The study included patients that had not been previously treated with BRAF inhibitors. For patients that had been previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor, study NO25395 included a number of patients that had progressed following vemurafenib-treatment and showed that efficacy in terms of ORR and duration of response was lower in patients that progressed following BRAF inhibitor treatment compared to in BRAF-naive treated patients. Taking into account that in clinical practice, a proportion of patients will have been previously treated with other BRAF inhibitors, the CHMP highlighted that the combination treatment may not provide the same clinical benefit in those patients as what has been observed in naïve patients enrolled in the clinical trials not previously treated with MAPK kinase pathway inhibitors and that clinical benefit has not been demonstrated in this patient population. Nevertheless, the indication was not restricted as it was considered that patients previously treated with BRAF inhibitors could still derive some benefit from the combination therapy.</p><p>New therapeutic options have been approved recently for melanoma, some targeting the immune system instead of the melanoma cancer cells. Immunotherapeutic agents such as ipilimumab, pembrolizumab and nivolumab are not thought to interfere with the RAS, RAF, MEK, ERK signalling pathway and with the BRAF mutation status. However, based on the current data and information available, no recommendation can be given over the sequencing of therapies.</p><p>The safety and tolerability of the combination therapy appears to be acceptable and manageable through SmPC recommendations, routine pharmacovigilance and implementation of RMP measures.</p></div>

Major clinical target organs were hematopoiesis, liver, skin, GI, coagulation, lymphopoiesis and phosphorus metabolism. Microscopic degenerative, necrotic, and/or apoptotic changes were found in high dose animals in the liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract tissues, bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, reproductive tract tissues (ovary, seminal vesicles, epididymis, and vagina), and adrenal cortex. The nonclinical toxicology findings associated with cobimetinib administration to rats and dogs were consistent with pharmacologically mediated changes as a result of MEK1/MEK2 inhibition and disruption of MAPK signalling pathways.</figDesc></figure>

The lack of dedicated carcinogenicity studies is acceptable in accordance with the ICH S9 guide line. Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with cobimetinib. Standard genotoxicity studies with cobimetinib were negative (SmPC section 5.3).The applicant did not submit dedicated fertility and early embryonic development studies. This is acceptable in accordance with the ICH S9 guideline. No dedicated fertility studies in animals have been performed with cobimetinib. In the repeat-dose toxicology studies, degenerative changes wereobserved in reproductive tissues including increased apoptosis/necrosis of corpora lutea and seminal vesicle, epididymal and vaginal epithelial cells in rats, and epididymal epithelial cells in dogs. The clinical relevance of this is unknown (SmPC section 5.3). The findings were present in rat at subclinical exposure levels (0.7 times clinical exposure). The findings were reversible after recovery. Thus, impaired female fertility has been included in the RMP as an important identified risk and will be managed through routine pharmacovigilance (SmPC section 4.6 and 5.3). Reproduction toxicity was evaluated in a study in rat in the high dose group (10 mg/kg/day) dams which showed severe clinical conditions in terms of body weight gain and food consumption. Foetuses from these dams also showed malformations of the great vessels and skull. The high dose was equivalent to a 1.4-times the clinical exposure. Thus, it can be concluded that cobimetinib is teratogenic at clinically relevant levels. When administered to pregnant rats, cobimetinib caused embryolethality and foetal malformations of the great vessels and skull at systemic exposures similar to human exposure at recommended dose (SmPC section 5.3). Therefore, the risk of teratogenicity and developmental toxicity has been included as an important potential risk in the RMP.</figDesc></figure>

ERK1/2 are the only known substrates of MEK1/2, which in turn are inhibited by cobimetinib. Oncogenic mutations in BRAF are found in approximately 50% of malignant melanoma tumours and result in constitutive activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway in the absence of typical growth factors leading to excessive cell proliferation, and survival 3 .</figDesc></figure>

Approximately 500 patients were to be randomized; the final analysis of PFS was to take place when approximately 206 PFS events had occurred. The Type 1 error for the analysis of the primary endpoint of PFS was 0.05(2-sided). No interim analyses of the primary endpoint (PFS) and the secondary endpoint BORR were to be performed.Three OS analyses (two interim analyses and one final analysis) were originally planned as following:the first OS interim analysis at the time of the primary PFS analysis (projected to occur approximately 16 months after the first patient was randomised), the second OS interim analysis after the occurrence of 256 events (projected to occur at approximately 27 months after the first patient was randomised), and the final analysis of OS after the occurrence of 385 deaths (projected to occur at approximately 46 months after the first patient was randomised).

The former definition specified that patients who were randomized at least 18 weeks before the data cutoff date were to be included in the analysis. The revised definition specified that all randomized patients, regardless of whether or not study treatment was received, would be included in the analysis. Additionally, the subgroup analysis for time since metastatic disease diagnosis (&lt; 6 months, ≥ 6 months) was deleted because the information required for this analysis (the date of metastatic diagnosis) was not collected.-SAP Version 3 (23 February 2015), the final OS analysis plan was changed to perform the final OS analysis after the occurrence of 250 deaths from the initial plan of 385 deaths. 26 patients, 12 (4.9%) in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm and 14 (5.6%) in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm) had at least one violation of the inclusion or exclusion criteria. The most common deviations from entry criteria were history of clinically significant cardiac dysfunction (exclusion criterion 8: 12 patients, 6 (2.4%) in each arm); and risk factors for RVO (exclusion criterion 7: 4 patients, 1 and 3 in the respective arms).</figDesc></figure>

However, when cobimetinib was co-administered with vemurafenib in Study NO25395, a concentration-dependent increase in ∆QTcF was detected (slope, 0.0217 ms per ng/mL) after adjusting for vemurafenib effect in the model (seeFigure below, Panel B). Similar results were obtained when data from Study NO25395 were analysed separately. is characterized as highly soluble and moderate to highly permeable compound. The absorption was almost complete with an estimated fraction absorbed of 88% although the absolute bioavailability was calculated to be 46%. A high fat meal did not influence the systemic exposure compared to under fasted condition. Following oral dosing of 60 mg in cancer patients, cobimetinib showed a moderate rate of absorption with a median T max of 2.4 hours. The mean steady-state C max and AUC 0-24 were 273 ng/mL and 4340 ng.h/mL respectively. The mean accumulation ratio at steady state was approximately 2.4-fold.Cobimetinib has linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of ~3.5 mg to 100 mg. The absolute bioavailability of cobimetinib was 45.9% (90% CI: 39.7%, 53.1%) in healthy subjects. A human mass balance study was conducted in healthy subjects, and showed that cobimetinib was extensively metabolised and eliminated in faeces. The fraction absorbed was ~88% indicating high absorption and first pass metabolism. The pharmacokinetics of cobimetinib are not altered when administered in the fed state (high-fat meal) compared with the fasted state in healthy subjects.

As the pharmacokinetics of cobimetinib in subjects with different degrees of hepatic function has not been investigated, the CHMP has requested the applicant to submit the results of a post-authorisation study GP29342, a Phase I, open label, single-dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of cobimetinib in subjects with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects (deadline: 31 December 2015). This study has been included in the RMP.In vitro investigations characterized CYP3A to be the main enzyme involved in the metabolism of cobimetinib. This was confirmed an in vivo DDI study where the total exposure of cobimetinib increased about 7-fold when co-administered with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor. A 7-fold increase in exposure when inhibiting CYP3A means that CYP3A metabolism represents 85% of the total elimination. Therefore, concurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors during treatment with Cotellic should be avoided. Caution should be exercised if a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor is co-administered with Cotellic. If concomitant use with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor is unavoidable, patients should be carefully monitored for safety and dose modifications applied if clinically indicated (seeTable 1in section 4.2 and section 4.4). Cobimetinib is metabolized by CYP3A and cobimetinib AUC increased approximately 7-fold in the presence of a strong CYP3A inhibitor (itraconazole) in healthy subjects. The magnitude of interaction could potentially be lower in patients. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (see section 4.4.): Avoid concurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors during treatment with cobimetinib. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include, but are not limited to, ritonavir, cobicistat, telaprevir, lopinavir, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, posaconazole and nefazodone. If concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor is unavoidable, patients should be carefully monitored for safety. For strong CYP3A inhibitors used short-term (7 days or less), consider interrupting cobimetinib therapy during the duration of inhibitor use. Caution should be exercised if cobimetinib is coadministered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors include, but are not limited to, amiodarone, erythromycin, fluconazole, miconazole, diltiazem, verapamil, delavirdine, amprenavir, fosamprenavir, imatinib. When cobimetinib is co-administered with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor,patients should be carefully monitored for safety. CYP3A4 inducer, lower mean steady state concentration of cobimetinib was seen, compared to when administered alone. No conclusions can be drawn on a potential DDI effect due to few patients treated alone with cobimetinib in comparison with the combination. The steady state exposure of vemurafenib was slightly lower when co-administered with cobimetinib compared when administered alone meaning that a potential DDI between cobimetinib and vemurafenib cannot be ruled out when co-treated. In vitro cobimetinib showed a potential of both CYP3A induction and inhibition, however, the in vivo DDI study with midazolam did not show any difference in exposure if co-administered with cobimetinib. Co-administration of cobimetinib with a strong CYP3A inducer was not assessed in a clinical study, however, a reduction in cobimetinib exposure is likely. Therefore, concomitant use of moderate and strong CYP3A inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenytoin, and St. John's Wort) should be avoided. Alternative agents with no or minimal CYP3A induction should be considered. Given that cobimetinib concentrations are likely</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="2">Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (see section 4.4.): Mild CYP3A4 inhibitors: Cobimetinib can be co-administered with mild inhibitors of CYP3A without dose</cell></row><row><cell>adjustment.</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>When co-administered with vemurafenib, a</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>CYP3A inhibitors</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Assessment report</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>EMA/685908/2015</cell><cell>Page 53/139</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

However, even if the drug is eliminated mainly by metabolism, PK characterization in severe renal impairment should always be considered as severe renal impairment may affect the PK by diverse mechanisms. Based on preclinical data and the human mass balance study, cobimetinib is mainly metabolised, with minimal renal elimination. No formal pharmacokinetic study has been conducted in patients with renal impairment. A population pharmacokinetic analysis using data from 151 patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance (CRCL) 60 to less than 90 mL/min), 48 patients with moderate renal impairment (CRCL 30 to less than 60 mL/min), and 286 patients with normal renal function (CRCL greater than or equal to 90 mL/min), showed that CRCL had no meaningful influence on exposure of cobimetinib (SmPC section5.2). Mild to moderate renal impairment does not influence cobimetinib exposure based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis. There are minimal data for Cotellic in patients with severe renal impairment. No pharmacokinetic data in subjects with hepatic impairment are available. No significant covariates necessitating dose-adjustment were identified in the population pharmacokinetic model. Gender does not have an effect on the exposure of cobimetinib, based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis including 210 women and 277 men (SmPC section 5.2). Age does not have an effect on the exposure of cobimetinib, based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis including 133 patients ≥ 65 years of age (SmPC section 5.2). No dose adjustment is required in patients aged ≥65 years old (SmPC section 4.2). No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment based on population pharmacokinetic analysis (SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2). There are minimal data for Cotellic in patients with severe renal impairment. Cotellic should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment. The safety and efficacy of Cotellic has not been established in patients with hepatic impairment (SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2). There are no pharmacokinetic data in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Cotellic should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment.Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, gender, race, ethnicity, baseline ECOG, mild and moderate renal impairment did not affect the pharmacokinetic of cobimetinib. Baseline age and baseline body weight were identified as statistically significant covariates on cobimetinib clearance and volume of distribution respectively. However, sensitivity analysis suggests neither of these covariates had clinically significant impact on steady state exposure (SmPC section 5.2).</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="2">Interaction studies have only been performed in adults (SmPC section 4.5).

Therefore, the applicant is requested to submit the results of study GP29342: A Phase I, open label, single-dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of cobimetinib in subjects with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects. The single-agent MEK4592g study (a Phase I Dose-Escalation Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Cobimetinib Administered Orally Daily to Subjects with Solid Tumors) established the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of cobimetinib at 100 mg daily when delivered on a 14/14 schedule and 60 mg daily when delivered on a 21/7 schedule. Exposures (as measured by Cmax and AUC parameters) increased proportionally with dose up to a dose of 100 mg QD and supported the use of either the 14/14 or the 21/7 regimen. Study NO25395 (BRIM7) determined the MTD and the recommended Phase 3 dose and schedule of the combination as vemurafenib 960 mg BID and cobimetinib 60 mg daily 21/7. At that dose and schedule of the combination, both drugs were delivered at their respective single agent MTDs and at the highest dose of both agents delivered concurrently. Furthermore, the 21/7 dosing schedule allowed for a more prolonged exposure of cobimetinib during a treatment cycle.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Deadline: 31 December 2015</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>2.5.

For patients reporting new or worsening visual disturbances, an ophthalmologic examination is recommended. Serous retinopathycan be managed with treatment interruption, dose reduction or with treatment discontinuation (seeTable 1in section 4.2) (SmPC section 4.8). Therefore ocular events related to serous retinopathy (e.g.retinal detachment) have been included in the RMP as an important identified risk. The safety risk in patients with pre-existing retinal pathology or risk factors for retinal vein occlusion has been described as missing information. The risk will be monitored through PSURs and a recommendation was highlighted in the PL for patients to discuss with their HCP if they have eye problems. Diarrhoea has also been included as an important identified risk and will be managed through a warning included in section 4.4. Cases of Grade ≥3 and serious diarrhoea have been reported in patients treated with Cotellic. Diarrhoea should be managed with antidiarrhoeal agents and supportive care. For Grade ≥3 diarrhoea that occurs despite supportive care, Cotellic and vemurafenib should be withheld until diarrhoea has improved to Grade ≤1. If Grade ≥3 diarrhoea recurs, the dose of Cotellic and vemurafenib should be reduced (see section 4.2).Bleeding events have been reported more frequently in the Cotellic plus vemurafenib arm than in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm (all types and Grades: 10% vs 6%).

Visual disturbances have been reported in some patients treated with cobimetinib during clinical trials (see sections4.4 and   4.8). Patients should be advised not to drive or use machines if they experience visual disturbances or any other adverse effects that may affect their ability (SmPC section 4.7).The majority of patients in Study GO28141 were below 65 years of age. Patients aged 65-74, 75-84, and 85+ accounted for 17.3%, 6.7%, and 1.6% of patients, respectively in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm, and 18.8%, 8.8%, and 0.4%, respectively in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm.Thus there were small sample sizes in each subgroup. In general, safety findings were consistent with the findings reported in the GO28141 CSR for the overall study population but the frequencies of serious AEs in both study arms were higher among older patients (above 65 years). Frequencies of AEs leading to discontinuation of cobimetinib/placebo, hospitalization, and Sum of the [incidence of] AEs postural hypotension, falls, black outs, syncope, dizziness, ataxia, and fractures were also higher in cobimetinib-treated older patients than in age-matched patients in the control arm. In addition, a numerically greater percentage of patients aged 65-74 and 75-84, compared to patients below 65 years of age, reported a clinically meaningful decrease in global health status, in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm. In the placebo plus vemurafenib arm, there were no trends in decrease in global health status by age group. Thus, although the experience in patients ≥65 years is limited, tolerability seems to be more restricted in this age group. In the Phase III study with Cotellic in combination with 2%) were aged ≥85 years The proportion of patients experiencing adverse events (AE) was similar in the patients aged &lt;65 years and those aged ≥65 years. Patients ≥65 years were more likely to experience serious adverse events (SAEs) and experience AEs leading to discontinuation of cobimetinib than those &lt;65 years (SmPC section 4.8). Caution should be exercised when cobimetinib is administered with moderate inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A. Co-administration of strong inhibitors or strong inducers with cobimetinib should be avoided.No pharmacokinetic trial in subjects with renal impairment has been conducted.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_95"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>The rather high frequency of discontinuations and the remarkably high rate of dose interruptions/reductions due to AEs clearly indicate a limited tolerability of cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib. The nature of the AEs that led to either drug interruptions/dose reductions or drug discontinuations appear to be largely overlapping in preferred terms/SOC and also showed a preference to occur during the early treatment cycles. Although most of these AEs were reversible and could be clinically managed, i.e. by dose interruption, dose reductions, and standard clinical measures, close monitoring during especially early cycles and in certain sub-groups, e.g. elderly, seems to be justified.The decision on whether to reduce the dose for either or both treatments should be based on the prescriber's assessment of individual patient safety or tolerability. Dose modification of Cotellic is dose modification. If doses are omitted for toxicity, these doses should not be replaced (SmPC section 4.2). Once the dose has been reduced, it should not be increased at a later time.Table 1in the SmPC section 4.2 gives general Cotellic dose modification guidance (SmPC section 4.2). Permanent discontinuation of Cotellic treatment should be considered if cardiac symptoms are attributed to Cotellic and do not improve after temporary interruption (SmPC section 4.2). Table 2 of the SmPC provides recommendation on dose modifications for Cotellic in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease from baseline (SmPC section 4.2). The risk of safety in patients with cardiac impairment (including congestive heart failure, current unstable angina, or left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 50%) has been included in the RMP as missing information. The risk will be managed through recommendations for dose reduction and treatment discontinuation guidance for left Cotellic should be continued at the prescribed dose. The dose of vemurafenib may be reduced as clinically appropriate. Please refer to the vemurafenib SmPC. Cotellic dosing does not need to be modified or interrupted to manage asymptomatic CPK elevations. Cotellic and vemurafenib should be interrupted until resolution to Grade ≤1. Treatment can be restarted with no change in Cotellic dose. Vemurafenib dosing should be reduced as clinically appropriate, please refer to its SmPC for further information. Rash Rash events may occur with either Cotellic or vemurafenib treatment. The dose of Cotellic and/or vemurafenib may be either temporarily interrupted and/or reduced as clinically indicated. Grade ≤2 (tolerable) rash should be managed with supportive care. Cotellic dosing can be continued without modification. -Grade 2 (intolerable) or Grade ≥3 acneiform rash: General dose modification recommendations in Table 1 for Cotellic should be followed. Vemurafenib dosing can be continued when Cotellic treatment is modified (if clinically indicated). -Grade 2 (intolerable) or Grade ≥3 non-acneiform or maculopapular rash: Cotellic dosing can be continued without modification if clinically indicated. Vemurafenib dosing may be either temporarily interrupted and/or reduced, please refer to its SmPC for further information. There is no experience with overdose in human clinical trials. In case of suspected overdose, cobimetinib should be withheld and supportive care instituted. There is no specific antidote for overdosage with cobimetinib (SmPC section 4.8).From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.

This pattern was observed in diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, serous retinopathy/retinal detachment, photosensitivity, blood creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) increased, ALT increased, AST increased, pyrexia, rash, arthralgia, and fatigue. The frequent discontinuations (almost 20 % in the cobimetinib + vemurafenib arm) discontinued at least one study drug due to AEs) and very frequent dose interruptions/reductions (≥60 % interrupted dose or reduced the dose of at least 1 study drug) in the pivotal study GO28141, reflected this temporal pattern of the incidence of ADRs. Reduced doses of cobimetinib or vemurafenib may have contributed to the decreased incidence of AEs in later treatment cycles. Thus, close monitoring of patients and implementation of dose interruptions/reductions is included as recommendations in section 4.2 of the SmPC.In conclusion, safety and tolerability of cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma appears acceptable and clinically manageable.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Assessment report</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>EMA/685908/2015</cell><cell>Page 119/139</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

Several important identified risks have been identified. Cases of serous retinopathy have been reported in patients treated with cobimetinib (SmPC section 4.4.) For patients reporting new or worsening visual disturbances, an ophthalmologic examination is recommended. Serous retinopathy can be managed with treatment interruption, dose reduction or with treatment discontinuation (SmPC section 4.2) (SmPC section 4.8). Decrease in LVEF from baseline has been reported in patients receiving cobimetinib (SmPC section 4.4). LVEF should be evaluated before initiation of treatment to establish baseline values, then after the first month of treatment and at least every 3 months or as clinically indicated until treatment discontinuation. Decrease in LVEF from baseline can be managed using treatment interruption, dose reduction or with treatment discontinuation (see SmPC section 4.2).Photosensitivity has been observed with a higher frequency in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib vs placebo plus vemurafenib arm (41% vs 31%). The majority of events were Grades 1 or 2, with Grade ≥3 events occurring in 3% of patients in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm vs 0% in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm. This risk will be managed through recommendations in the SmPC section 4.2 for dose interruptions of both cobimetinib and vemurafenib.Cases of Grade ≥3 and serious diarrhoea have been reported in patients treated with Cotellic.Diarrhoea should be managed with antidiarrhoeal agents and supportive care (SmPC section 4.4).There were several important potential risks (rhabdomyolysis, serious hepatotoxicity, impaired female fertility, teratogenicity and developmental toxicity) that have been identified in the RMP. These will be managed through SmPC recommendations in the SmPC (section 4.2, 4.6 and 4.8) and through routine pharmacovigilance.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Assessment report</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>EMA/685908/2015</cell><cell>Page 135/139</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>
