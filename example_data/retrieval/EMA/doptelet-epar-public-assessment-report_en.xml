<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>. Disease or condition</head><p>Avatrombopag 40 mg or 60 mg once daily for 5 days is proposed as an alternative treatment option to platelet transfusions for patients with thrombocytopenia and CLD scheduled for a procedure to minimise bleeding and other safety risks, and to improve clinical management.</p><p>TPO, the principal physiologic regulator of platelet production, is produced constitutively in the liver, circulates in the bloodstream, and is delivered to the bone marrow, where it stimulates the early development and maturation of multiple haematopoietic lineages and megakaryocytopoiesis; bone marrow production of platelets is directly affected by TPO levels. As a result of the damage to the liver in patients with CLD, TPO production is reduced, which results in decreased platelet production and thrombocytopenia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Epidemiology</head><p>The prevalence of chronic liver condition in Europe, irrespective of cause, is estimated to be 29 million, of a total population of some 742 million people. The prevalence of cirrhosis and hepatitis C have been estimated to be 0.1 % and from 0.13-3.26%, respectively (Blachier 2013). The estimates correspond to 14 to 26 new cases cirrhosis per 100,000 inhabitants per year, with large intra-European variations, more males than females, and annually some 170.000 deaths in Europe, but a trend towards increase (Blachier 2013; Akinyemiju 2017).</p><p>Thrombocytopenia is a common complication in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD), with an incidence from 64% to 85% of patients with cirrhosis, and often worsens with the progression of liver insufficiency <ref type="bibr">(Afdhal 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gingireddy 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Micthell 2016)</ref>. However, a mild to moderate reduction in platelet count is not consequently a contributing factor to bleeding in invasive procedures for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. Normally a platelet count is 150 -400 x 10(9)/L, but only severe thrombocytopenia, below 50 x 10(9)/L is considered of clinical relevance in procedures with a bleeding risk -that may be biopsies, dental treatment, punctures, catherisations etc. For the individual with severe thrombocytopenia the complication of bleeding may be at risk several times a year, because the platelet count in most chronic patients worsens during the course, and invasive procedures are performed for many purposes.</p><p>The prevalence of severe thrombocytopenia is reported to be 1% of cirrhotic patients, similar in chronic hepatitis C, but maybe less common in other causes for CLD <ref type="bibr">(Peck-Radosavljevic 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">: Bashour 2000</ref>.</p><p>However, the treatment of hepatitis C has improved, and the platelet counts probably (may) increase due to the better viral load control. Given the precautions to calculate, the medical need to support the platelet count in a scheduled procedure in cirrhosis affects less than 10.000 persons in Europe. However, other causes for CLD as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis are increasingly a cause of cirrhosis globally. This burden is expected to increase as epidemics of obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome continue to grow (Estes 2018). In addition, no data are available as to how many invasive procedures, each patient is going through, but since they include dental procedures, punctures etc., the annual need for treatment possibly is many times higher than the number of patients with platelet counts less than 50 x 10(9)/L.</p><p>The risk of bleeding in procedures varies, like complications in general, with the procedure, if the intervention is planned or to be done without a time for preparation, time of day, doctoral skills and experience, supportive procedures like imaging, and the status of the patient -like BMI and overall comorbidity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3.">Aetiology and pathogenesis</head><p>TPO, the principal physiologic regulator of platelet production, is produced constitutively in the liver, circulates in the bloodstream, and is delivered to the bone marrow, where it stimulates the early development of multiple haematopoietic lineages and megakaryocytopoiesis. Bone marrow production of platelets is directly affected by TPO levels. Liver disease, including hepatitis C and cirrhosis, may lead to reduced TPO production and consequently result in decreased platelet production.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.4.">Clinical presentation and diagnosis</head><p>Thrombocytopenia presents a significant challenge in the clinical management of patients with CLD, since they require multiple invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures over the course of their disease, routinely 1 to 3 invasive procedures annually, each of which carries a risk of bleeding. These include clinically necessary liver biopsies, thoracenteses, endoscopies/colonoscopies/bronchoscopies with and without biopsies, chemoablation and radiofrequency ablation, intrahepatic shunt placement, vascular catheterizations, and even dental procedures. There are no approved pharmaceutical options to treat thrombocytopenia in patients with CLD undergoing procedures, and if not effectively treated, thrombocytopenia can lead to serious uncontrolled bleeding, resulting in prolonged hospitalizations and other post-procedure complications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.5.">Management</head><p>Transfusion with thrombocytes isolated from blood from healthy donors, and routinely packed in platelet concentrates from 4-6 donors to increase the thrombocyte count in the blood product, is the most effective, standard substitution to optimize the thrombocyte count before a scheduled procedure in a patient with severe thrombocytopenia <ref type="bibr">(Hayashi 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kaufman 2015)</ref>. The transfusion with platelets has an immediate effect, but may be accompanied by HLA-allo immunisation and reactions, blood-product born infection and an effect lasting 24-48 hours (at most) to maintain a platelet count above 50 x 10(9)/L, considered safe for most procedures. Alternative handling in development is pharmaceutical strategies <ref type="bibr">(Maan 2015)</ref> or ex vivo derived artificial platelet structures (Hickman 2018).</p><p>Lusutrombopag, a TPO-receptor agonists, was recently authorised in Europe for the use in patients with thrombocytopenia.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Active Substance</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General information</head><p>The chemical name of avatrombopag is 1-(3-Chloro-5-{[4-(4-chlorothiophen-2-yl)-5-(4-cyclohexylpiperazin-1-yl)-1,3-thiazol-2-yl]carbamoyl} pyridin-2-yl)piperidine-4-carboxylic acid maleate corresponding to the molecular formula C 33 H 38 Cl 2 N 6 O 7 S 2 (C 29 H 34 Cl 2 N 6 O 3 S 2 ・C 4 H 4 O 4 ). It has a relative molecular mass of 765.73 g/mol and the following structure: The chemical structure of active substance was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis, ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV), infrared spectroscopy (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and mass spectrometry.</p><p>The active substance is a non-hygroscopic white to off white powder freely soluble in 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, dimethyl sulfoxide and N-methylpyrrolidone, slightly soluble in methanol and ethanol (dehydrated) and practically insoluble in water, acetonitrile, acetone, ethyl acetate, hexane, and tert-butylmethyl ether</p><p>The active substance has a non -chiral molecular structure.</p><p>Polymorphism has been observed for the active substance. Three anhydrous crystal forms (Form-A, Form-B, and Form-C) of avatrombopag maleate have been identified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacture, characterisation and process controls</head><p>The active substance is synthesized in 5 main steps encompassing eight chemical transformations plus salt formation using commercially available well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications.</p><p>Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. Critical process parameters (CPPs) in the synthesis, identified by risk assessment, chemical knowledge and experimentation are provided. As each step contains critical process parameters, all five manufacturing steps are designated as critical steps.</p><p>The control of critical steps in the manufacture of avatrombopag maleate is achieved by controlling all CPPs with in each proven acceptable range (PAR).The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.</p><p>The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances.</p><p>Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. Data of the mutagenic impurity assessment including Ames testing and in-silico predictions has been provided.</p><p>The identified mutagenic impurities are sufficiently controlled at the intermediate steps with adequate limits.</p><p>The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical development program. During development, the process has been optimized to achieve the commercial manufacturing process without changing the synthetic route. During manufacturing process development PARs were established for all process parameters which were considered important for consistent manufacturing of avatrombopag maleate. Additionally, quality attributes (QAs) were used to designate material attributes and (potential) critical quality attributes that were evaluated by risk. Each attribute was assessed against the unit process(es) that may influence it, using the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) tool. This output was then used to confirm the PARs for the Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) of the manufacturing process. Only parameters assessed as a medium or a high risk (e.g. CPP or potential CPP) in the FMEA risk assessment were further evaluated, as this output indicated a potential risk to the control of quality. No further studies were conducted for those parameters deemed non-critical or low risk.</p><p>For those parameters assessed as a CPP, a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach or traditional range-finding univariate analysis was employed, depending on the variable. DoE was used for multivariate analysis, e.g., where multiple variables could affect the outcome for the unit operation (i.e., reactions, isolation, etc.). A traditional range finding approach (univariate analysis) was performed for parameters such as solvent volumes, where only a single variable was involved in the outcome for that unit operation, (i.e., impurity purging during crystallization and isolation) as determined during the risk assessment and development history. PARs were set for all process parameters which were considered as important for the stable manufacturing.</p><p>PARs are considered to have been adequately justified, providing confidence of comprehensive knowledge of synthesis. Target setting/normal operating range has been added. Confirmation has been</p><p>given that as design space has not been claimed, PARs will only be deliberately changed one at a time.</p><p>Two types of container closure systems are applied for avatrombopag maleate; one is a polyethylene bag that is made of a mixture of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and linear low-density polyethylene <ref type="bibr">(LLDPE)</ref> film as a primary container and triple laminated aluminum pouch as a secondary container. Another is a polyethylene bag which is made of LDPE film as a primary container and quadruple laminated aluminum pouch as a secondary container. Both packaging comply with the EC directives 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specification</head><p>The active substance specification includes tests for description (appearance), identification (IR, XRPD), water content (KF), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), maleic acid content (HPLC), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), particle size (light diffraction), residual solvents (GC), and microbial limits (Ph. Eur).</p><p>Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set.</p><p>The analytical methods used have been adequately described and <ref type="bibr">(non-compendial methods)</ref> appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for identification, assay and impurities testing has been presented.</p><p>Batch analysis data of 17 commercial and pilot scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability</head><p>Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers stored LDPE-LLDPE bag placed in triple laminated aluminum bag for up to 48 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH)</p><p>according to the ICH guidelines were provided.</p><p>Additionally, bridging stability studies (BSS) were conducted for the material change of polyethylene bag as alternative primary container LDPE bag placed in quadruple laminated aluminium bag for up to 12 Assessment report EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 Page 15/123 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.</p><p>The following parameters were tested: description (appearance), identification, water content, related substances and assay.</p><p>No trends were observed for any batches and there were no significant changes under long term and accelerate stability conditions in the stability and bridging stability studies.</p><p>Stress testing in solid/aqueous solution states is also conducted. Stress testing in solid state has been conducted to investigate the intrinsic stability of avatrombopag maleate, heat (50°C), or humidity (25°C/75%) in solid state. From the results, avatrombopag maleate was found to be stable under heat and humidity conditions. Stress testing in solution state has been investigated to establish the degradation pathways of avatrombopag maleate. In this study, avatrombopag maleate was subjected to acid (2% trifluoroacetic acid) and base (0.1 mol/L sodium hydroxide) stress conditions so as to induce degradation. Three major degradation products were identified by HPLC analysis and the degradation pathways are established Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 1 batch. Slight degradation was observed during light exposure. Therefore, avatrombopag maleate needs to be protected from light.</p><p>The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 48 months stored in the commercial packaging configurations to protect from light in the proposed container.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Finished Medicinal Product</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development</head><p>The finished product is round, yellow, biconvex, immediate release film-coated tablets debossed with "AVA" on one side and "20" on the other.</p><p>The finished product pharmaceutical development and control strategy are considered traditional.</p><p>However, principles of QbD as described in ICH Q8 through Q11 such as definition of a quality target product profile (QTPP) associated finished product critical quality attributes (CQAs) as well as formulation and process risk assessments have been utilised in formulation and process development to develop the control strategy. A design space has not been claimed by the applicant. The parameters within a unit operation (mixing, granulation, tableting, etc.) were evaluated using a risk-based approach to establish the PARs. The PAR ranges will only be changed deliberately one at a time.</p><p>The aim of the product development was to develop a tablet at an appropriate dose and of an appropriate size with acceptable palatability.</p><p>Avatrombopag maleate is practically insoluble in water in the pH range of 1 to 9. The effect of the active substance particle size on the dissolution profile of finished product was investigated using laboratory scale batches. Based on the results, it was concluded that when the particle size of the active substance is controlled by the specification of the active substance, there was no significant variation in dissolution of the finished product. As mentioned, three different anhydrous crystal forms (Form-A, Form-B, and</p><p>Form-C) of avatrombopag maleate have been identified. The current manufacturing process and controls consistently provides the desired polymorphic form. Control strategies during the manufacturing process and storage are employed to ensure no solid state transformation of avatrombopag maleate in the finished product. Firstly, the water content of the finished product during the manufacturing process is controlled (storage condition of intermediate, in-process control at bulk packaging process and environment control in primary packaging process). Secondly, a moisture proof packaging configuration (Alu/Alu blisters) was selected as the primary packaging. No solid state transformation of avatrombopag maleate was detected in finished product during both finished product manufacturing and storage.</p><p>The compatibility of the active substance with excipients was assessed focusing on the stability in the formulation design of the finished product. No active substance degradation was observed in mixtures with any excipients, except opadry yellow. Because of limited contact of active substance with opadry yellow as a coating, degradation of active substance in the tablet formulation was not expected. This was confirmed by stability studies. The excipients were selected to enable optimum dissolution of the finished product. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph.</p><p>Eur. standards except the opadry yellow which complies with in-house specifications. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report.</p><p>Three different oral formulations were used in clinical studies. A powder for oral suspension (PFS) formulation and two film-coated tablet formulations. The initial Phase 1 clinical studies were supplied with the PFS formulation. Subsequent Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies were supplied with avatrombopag film coated tablets (Formulation A). Formulation A had poor flowability and it induced low content uniformity. Therefore, it was evaluated as a low scalability product. Subsequently, film coated tablets (Formulation B) were developed. Formulation B was chosen for marketing. Three third generation prototype formulations (Formulation C) of the finished product (cyclodextrin oral solution, oral suspension, and lipid-based powder for oral suspension) were tested in an effort to improve the bioavailability and reduce the variability in pharmacokinetics (PK). A study was conducted to evaluate characteristics of Formulation C relative to Formulation B. However, none of these formulations were pursued for further development based on the overall PK profiles and manufacturing challenges.</p><p>Bioequivalence studies were performed showing bioequivalence between the clinical formulation and the proposed commercial formulation</p><p>The USP&lt;711&gt; paddle method was selected as the dissolution method. The discriminatory power of the selected method was demonstrated with regard to particle size of the active substance.</p><p>An initial risk assessment for the manufacturing process at commercial scale was performed so as to identify process parameters that were likely to affect the Quality Attributes (QAs) and Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs). Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), as exemplified in the ICH Guideline Q9 "Quality Risk Management," was employed. The initial risk assessment was performed based on the understanding obtained at pilot scale and prior knowledge during the development of the finished product. To identify the CQAs, classification of QAs/CQA was conducted based on the effect on safety or efficacy, and the Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP). QAs which were classified as 'Extreme' were re-designated as CQAs as it was deemed that there could be considerable effect on safety or efficacy. QAs which were deemed to have (a) an indirect effect or no effect on safety or efficacy were classified as 'low', (b) slight effect were designated as 'middle' and (c) potential effect on safety and/or efficacy were classified as 'high'. However, no risk parameter was considered as high. Nine risk parameters were categorized as potentially middle risk. For the potentially middle risk parameters, the effect of these parameters on QAs/CQA and the acceptable range for the parameters were evaluated. For the potentially low risk parameters, evaluations were also conducted to confirm the suitability of the operating conditions adopted. Based on the results of the initial risk assessment by FMEA, each process parameter was thoroughly investigated. Process parameters potentially having a critical effect on QAs/CQA were further evaluated in the process development studies. Based on the results of the studies, the risk level for each process parameter affecting QAs/CQA was mitigated by establishing appropriately fixed PARs, and optimized operating conditions at the commercial production scale. Based on the results obtained from manufacturing process and formulation development studies, the risks for the commercial production process were reassessed and revised. The risk levels of all process parameters originally identified by FMEA were mitigated to "low". Therefore, it was concluded that a robust manufacturing processes has been established for the finished product. A design space has not been claimed by the applicant, and the parameters within a unit operation (mixing, granulation, tableting, etc.) were evaluated using a risk-based approach to establish the PARs. The PAR ranges will only be changed deliberately one at a time.</p><p>The finished product is packaged in polyamide and polyvinyl chloride laminated aluminium film with push-through aluminium and polyethylene terephthalate foil blisters. Specifications for the forming film and the lidding foil have been presented, which include identification testing and dimensions.</p><p>Confirmations have been given that the packaging materials in immediate contact with the finished product conform to relevant Ph. Eur. chapters and/or comply with EU quality requirements for materials to come into contact with food. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacture of the product and process controls</head><p>The manufacturing process consists of ten main steps: mixing 1, milling, mixing 2, granulation, sizing, lubrication, tableting, coating, bulk packaging, and blister packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process.</p><p>Control of critical manufacturing steps is achieved through established operating parameters critical to the finished product (mixing 1, milling, mixing 2, granulation, sizing, lubrication, tableting and coating) meeting its final product specifications. The respective parameter settings and proven acceptance ranges (PARs) were selected based upon the results of studies.</p><p>Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Product specification</head><p>The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: description (visual), identification (UV/Vis, HPLC or HPLC-PDA), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.) uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.) and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.)</p><p>The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.</p><p>Batch analysis results are provided for 15 commercial and pilot batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.</p><p>The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional final product release testing</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability of the product</head><p>Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 48 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are representative to those proposed for marketing as the active substance used is manufactured in a different site than the one proposed for marketing and were packed in a similar primary packaging proposed for marketing. The difference is that the lidding foil of the product monitored in the registration stability study does not have the outer layer of PET as the proposed for marketing.</p><p>Samples were tested for description, related substances, assay, dissolution, loss on drying, and microbial limits. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.</p><p>Under long-term and accelerated conditions no significant changes have been observed.</p><p>However, as the product batches subjected to stability testing at long-term and accelerated conditions, have been obtained using active substance manufactured at a site different from that proposed and the container closure system for these batches does not correspond to that proposed for marketing, the CHMP recommends to conduct accelerated stability testing on the first three commercial batches of each packaging configuration (10 and 15 tablet count) in the final commercial packaging, including the polyamide and polyvinyl chloride laminated aluminium film with push-through aluminium and polyethylene terephthalate foil blisters.</p><p>In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. Generally, there were no changes compared to the dark control, only there was an increase in loss on drying which is not unexpected since the photostability study is</p><p>conducted on an open Petri dish. These results support the conclusion that protection from light is not required during manufacturing, distribution, or long term storage.</p><p>Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 48 months without special storage conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Introduction</head><p>Avatrombopag is an orally active, small molecule thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist that stimulates proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes from bone marrow progenitor cells resulting in increased production of platelets. Avatrombopag does not compete with TPO for binding to the TPO receptor and has an additive effect with TPO on platelet production.</p><p>Avatrombopag does not stimulate platelet production in mice, rats, monkeys, or dogs because of the unique TPO receptor specificity. Therefore, data from these animal studies do not fully model potential adverse effects related to platelet count increases due to avatrombopag in humans. Avatrombopag did not affect the differentiation of human hematopoietic progenitor cells even at a concentration of 3 μmol/L, which is approximately a100-fold higher concentration than the EC 50 value of avatrombopag for human megakaryocyte colony formation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary pharmacodynamic studies</head><p>Both avatrombopag and rhTPO promoted differentiation of human PB CD34+ cells into CD41+CD45+ cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Ploidy distribution was analyzed at concentrations of 3 µmol/L avatrombopag and 3 nmol/L rhTPO. In the ploidy analysis, cells expressing CD41 and with positive propidium iodide staining were regarded as megakaryocytes, since erythrocytes and platelets do not have DNA. Following surface marker staining, DNA analysis was performed after staining with propidium iodide.</p><p>No significant difference at each ploidy level was found in cells incubated with avatrombopag or rhTPO.</p><p>Avatrombopag or rhTPO alone increased the number of megakaryocytes in a concentration-dependent manner, and the maximum activity of avatrombopag was similar to that of rhTPO. In addition, avatrombopag was shown to increase the number of megakaryocytes further even in the presence of 3 nmol/L rhTPO; a combination of 3 μmol/L avatrombopag and 3 nmol/L rhTPO increased megakaryocytes approximately 2-fold more than 3 nmol/L rhTPO alone (P&lt;0.001). The numbers of hematopoietic progenitor cells (Figure 2.1.2), and megakaryocytic progenitor cells were also increased to a greater degree by the combination of avatrombopag and rhTPO compared with avatrombopag or rhTPO alone.</p><p>Avatrombopag induced phosphorylation of STAT3, STAT5, or ERK proteins in human blood platelets and Ba/F3-human c-Mpl cells, similar to rhTPO, demonstrating the ability of avatrombopag to activate both the JAK-STAT and SHC-Ras-Raf-ERK signaling pathways via human c-Mpl.</p><p>The species specificity of avatrombopag was evaluated by its ability to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 in blood platelets prepared from human, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, and beagle dog, common marmoset and squirrel, rhesus and cynomolgus monkey, hamster and pig, olive baboon, and chimpanzee. Similar to rhTPO, avatrombopag was shown to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 in human and chimpanzee blood platelets. Avatrombopag, however, did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 in platelets of any other species tested: rat, hamster, guinea pig, rabbit, beagle dog, common marmoset, squirrel monkey, rhesus monkey, cynomolgus monkey, olive baboon, and pig.</p><p>In contrast, rhTPO induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 in platelets of all tested species.</p><p>TM41 (inhibitor of TPO binding to human c-Mpl) inhibited 125 I-rhTPO binding to human platelets in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC 50 value of 515±32 μmol/L. In contrast, avatrombopag did not inhibit the binding of 125 I-rhTPO up to 100 μmol/L. Therefore, at a concentration 30,000-fold greater than the EC 50 value for proliferative activity of Ba/F3-human c-Mpl cells, avatrombopag had no effect on 125 I-rhTPO binding.</p><p>The extracellular domain (ECD) of human c-Mpl consists of 2 duplicate CRH domains referred to as CRH1 and CRH2. TPO binds the CRH1 domain of c-Mpl <ref type="bibr">(Sabath, et al., 1999)</ref>. Avatrombopag was demonstrated to have no effect in cynomolgus monkeys.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IN VIVO</head><p>The effects of avatrombopag on platelet production were investigated in NOD/SCID mice transplanted with human fetal liver CD34 + cells. Xenogeneic transplantation of human CD34 + PB stem cells into NOD/SCID mice provides an in vivo model to study human megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production <ref type="bibr">(Perez, et al. 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Avatrombopag was administered orally at doses of 0, 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg/day for 14 days to NOD/SCID mice engrafted with human fetal liver CD34 + cells, previously shown to produce greater than 0.09% of hCD41 + platelets from 17 or 18 weeks post-transplant. PB was collected before dosing and on Days 7, 14, 21, and 28 after the start of avatrombopag administration, and blood cell counts and hCD41 + platelets were measured.</p><p>Oral administration of avatrombopag increased the number of human platelets in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in approximately a 2.7-fold increase at 1 mg/kg/day and a 3.0-fold increase at 3 mg/kg/day at 14 days after the start of administration. The minimum effective dose was 1 mg/kg/day.</p><p>The unbound concentration of avatrombopag in plasma after a 14-day repeated administration of 1 mg/kg avatrombopag was estimated to be around 5 nmol/L (C max : 29.5 ng/mL; plasma protein binding:</p><p>89.0% to 89.7%). Cessation of avatrombopag administration caused the human platelet count to return to nearly pretreatment levels. In contrast, the murine platelet count did not change after oral administration of avatrombopag at any dose.</p><p>The effect of avatrombopag on platelet production was examined in cynomolgus monkeys. Six male cynomolgus monkeys were randomized to receive orally either 30 mg/kg/day of avatrombopag or vehicle for 14 days. Blood samples were drawn before dosing and on Days 7, 14, and 21 after the start of drug administration and hematologic parameters were measured using an automatic blood cell counter. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Binding Panel Assay</head><p>Avatrombopag was investigated for its binding at 1 and 10 μmol/L in duplicate to a panel of 86 receptors, transporters, and ion channels. Functional assays were also conducted for a secretin agonistic effect at 1 and 10 μmol/L, cholecystokinin 2 (CCK 2 ) agonistic/antagonistic effects at 5 concentrations up to 10 μmol/L. Enzyme assays were conducted for Na + /K + -ATPase at 1 and 10 μmol/L and for H + /K + -ATPase at 8 concentrations up to 100 μmol/L.</p><p>No significant effects (&gt;50% inhibition or activation) were observed with avatrombopag treatment at 1 μmol/L. Significant avatrombopag binding (≥50% inhibition) was observed at high concentration of 10 μmol/L to the adenosine A3 (A 3 ), angiotensin II type 1 (AT 1 ), CCK 2 , muscarinic 4 (M 4 ), neurokinin 2 (NK 2 ), neurokinin 3 (NK 3 ), 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 5A (5-HT 5a ) receptors, and the N-type Ca 2+ channel. Avatrombopag was shown to have an antagonistic effect for the CCK 2 receptor with an IC 50 value of 7.0 μmol/L. Avatrombopag had no effects on Na + /K + -ATPase or secretin agonistic activities at concentrations up to 10 μmol/L, or on H + /K + -ATPase at concentrations up to 100 μmol/L.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Platelet Aggregation</head><p>Human PRP was prepared from healthy volunteers. To examine the enhancing effect on platelet aggregation of avatrombopag and rhTPO, either avatrombopag (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 μmol/L), rhTPO (0.05, 0.5, 5, 50 nmol/L) or vehicle (PBS containing 0.35% bovine serum albumin) was added to PRP 5 minutes prior to the addition of ADP, and incubated at room temperature. ADP is a known inducer of platelet aggregation. To determine the platelet aggregation-inducing effect of avatrombopag and rhTPO alone, avatrombopag, rhTPO, or vehicle was added to the incubation mixture instead of ADP.</p><p>Avatrombopag did not induce or enhance platelet aggregation regardless of the absence or presence of ADP. In contrast, rhTPO (50 nmol/L) induced significant platelet aggregation in the absence of ADP, and rhTPO (5 and 50 nmol/L) enhanced ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Taken together, avatrombopag did not enhance or induce platelet aggregation even at 10 µmol/L, a concentration that is 2000-fold higher than the minimum effective concentration of rhTPO (5 nmol/L) on platelet aggregation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Platelet Activation</head><p>The effects of avatrombopag on human platelet activation were investigated by assessing the ability of avatrombopag to affect the expression of the platelet activation marker CD62P on human platelets in vitro and in vivo. CD62P is rapidly translocated to the plasma membrane upon platelet activation, and used as a marker of platelet activation.</p><p>In vivo, PRP was mixed with either avatrombopag (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 μmol/L), rhTPO (0.05, 0.5, 5, 50 nmol/L) or vehicle (PBS containing 0.35% bovine serum albumin). After 10 minutes, either ADP or saline was added and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. Platelet activation was measured using flow cytometry as the CD62P expression on platelets stimulated with ADP. Platelets were identified Avatrombopag did not significantly enhance the expression of CD62P on human platelets regardless of the absence or presence of ADP, supporting its lack of affect on platelet activation. On the other hand, rhTPO significantly induced the CD62P expression on human platelets both in the absence and presence of ADP. The enhancing effect of rhTPO is significant (P&lt;0.001) at an equal or greater concentration than 5 nmol/L in the presence of ADP, and significant (P&lt;0.01) at 0.5 nmol/L in the high-level ADP stimulation.</p><p>In the absence of ADP, 50 nmol/L of rhTPO significantly (P&lt;0.01) induced CD62P expression. Collectively, no significant effects were observed at avatrombopag concentrations up to 10 µmol/L, which is 20,000-fold higher than the minimum effective concentration (0.5 nmol/L) of rhTPO.</p><p>The in vivo effects of avatrombopag on platelet activation were subsequently investigated in NOD/SCID mice transplanted with human fetal liver CD34 + cells. Avatrombopag (0 or 3 mg/kg/day) was administered orally for 14 days to NOD/SCID mice transplanted with human fetal liver CD34 + cells. PB was collected on Day 15 after the start of avatrombopag administration and platelets were activated by the addition of thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRAP). Following platelet activation, blood cell counts, human platelets, and the expression of CD62P were determined. The time course of changes in human platelet number and the expression of CD62P were measured and expressed in terms of the rate of increase after drug administration relative to the value at predosing.</p><p>TRAP-induced CD62P expression was observed on human platelets produced by NOD/SCID mice transplanted with human fetal liver CD34 + cells. The maximum response of CD62P expression on human platelets induced by 167 μmol/L TRAP, an amount of TRAP in excess of that needed to induce platelet activation, was evaluated before and after avatrombopag administration. Human platelets were identified as the fractions stained by anti-human CD42a.</p><p>TRAP stimulation increased the CD62P fluorescence intensity on CD42a + fraction at a similar level in the vehicle group and before and after administration of avatrombopag in the 3mg/kg/day group. Oral administration of avatrombopag increased the number of human platelets, resulting in an approximately 2.0-fold platelet count increase (P&lt;0.05) on Day 15 after the start of administration. In contrast, TRAP-induced CD62P expression in human platelets was not changed by the administration of avatrombopag, and results were similar to the vehicle group. These results show that avatrombopag enhanced human platelet proliferation in the NOD/SCID mice, but that human platelet function was not influenced by avatrombopag even after exposure for 2 weeks. Furthermore, human platelets produced after administration of avatrombopag were considered to be as functional as those of the vehicle group,</p><p>given that the lifespan of a human platelet is approximately 10 days.</p></div>

The effects on resting membrane potentials, action potential amplitude, dV/dt max and action potential durations were evaluated. Avatrombopag induced no changes in any parameters up to the highest concentration.).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In VIVO</head><p>Avatrombopag was administered orally as a single dose (0, 3, 30 and 300 mg/kg) by gavage to unanesthetized telemetered beagle dogs to evaluate the effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory system. Cardiovascular (blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram) and respiratory (respiration rate and blood gas) effects, clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, body temperature, and toxicokinetics were evaluated. Avatrombopag was shown to have no effect on cardiovascular or respiratory function in dogs at doses up to 300 mg/kg. Vomiting was observed at ≥30 mg/kg at around t max . Systemic exposure was measured up to 48 hours after dosing. The t max was between 1 and 4 hours.</p><p>Exposure increased dose dependently between 3 and 30 mg/kg but less than dose proportionally between 30 and 300 mg/kg. Avatrombopag was administered orally by gavage as a single dose (0, 1, 10, and 100 mg/kg) to male F344 rats to evaluate the effects on the CNS using Irwin's procedure. The control group received an equivalent volume of vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose in water). Animals were observed for up to 48 hours postdose. There were no changes in any CNS parameters with avatrombopag at doses up to 100 mg/kg. when avatrombopag concentrations were no longer detected. The t max was between 2 and 3 hours, and exposure was similar between 30 and 300 mg/kg.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacodynamic drug interactions</head><p>No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been conducted with avatrombopag as these types of nonclinical studies are not required based on the ICH M3(R2) guidance. According to the EMA guideline on the Investigation of Drug Interactions, the potential for pharmacodynamic interactions should be considered for drugs which compete with each other at the pharmacological target and/or have similar or opposing pharmacodynamic effects and if such drugs are likely to be used concomitantly. As this is not the case with avatrombopag, no pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been conducted.</p><p>Potential pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been evaluated using human matrices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Pharmacokinetics</head><p>Single dose pharmacokinetic studies were conducted by the intravenous and oral route of administration transporter gene expressed cells or membrane vesicles were used to evaluate the susceptibility of avatrombopag to be a transport substrate, and the potential of avatrombopag to inhibit human transporters.</p><p>Bioanalytical methods for avatrombopag were developed and validated by several bioanalytical laboratories. Methods used were state of the art HPLC-UV or LC/MS methods preceded by extraction methods of liquid-liquid extraction or protein precipitation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Absorption -Single dose PK</head><p>Single-dose pharmacokinetics in nonclinical species mouse, rat (Fischer and SD), dog and monkey were characterized by relatively low clearance (0.25-0.55 L/kg/h) and small volume of distribution (1-2 L/kg) after intravenous administration of 0.3 or 1 mg/kg avatrombopag. Terminal half-life after i.v.</p><p>administration was similar in mice and dogs (2.7 h) and similar in rat and monkey 4.3 to 5.3 h).</p><p>After oral administration of 0.3, 1 or 3 mg/kg, time for maximal plasma concentration was 3-4 hours in rodents, 2 hours in dog and 4-5 hours in monkey. Terminal half-life after oral administration was not calculated in mouse and dog in the study referred. In study 1045-017 PK in dog (N=16) was evaluated after dosing 40 mg/dog in a suspension in 0.5% methylcellulose in water. Variability was high (&gt;66% for AUC and t½). Terminal half-life in dog in study 1045-017 was in the range of 3.1 to 17.8 hours. Terminal half-life was in the range of 3.9 to 7.2 h in rat and monkey. Bioavailability is considered to be high in mouse and Fischer rat (89-94%) and moderate in dog (52%) and monkey (49-67%). The dose of 1 mg/kg seemed to be exhibiting maximal plasma concentration in the vicinity of the clinical relevant plasma concentration of approximately 200 ng/mL.</p><p>A study was performed in SD rat for comparison of a solution and a suspension formulation of avatrombopag. In this study bioavailability was lower for both formulations as compared to the study in Fischer rat (solution 51% and suspension 37% in SD rat, vs approximately 90% in Fischer rat). The vehicle used for the solution formulation was similar in the two studies. It seems that the AUC0-inf for the intravenous dose is approximately twice that of the study in Fischer rat. Vd and CL is also different from the studies in mice and SD rat. No obvious reason was identified other than the difference in rat strain.</p><p>Exposure after oral administration was similar between the two rat strains. Oral administration was used in all toxicity studies.</p><p>A number of different vehicles have been used for dosing avatrombopag to nonclinical species by the oral route including tablets. In most of the submitted studies, the vehicle was 0.5% methylcellulose providing adequate consistency in study conduct including study 1045-017 in dog, which showed high variability in exposure. High variability in pharmacokinetics and exposure was also observed in dogs in the study including tablet formulations and e.g. in monkeys at pharmacologically relevant doses. The clinical relevance of the observations of high variability in exposure after oral administration in animals is unknown. However, avatrombopag have shown a relatively benign safety profile with adequate safety margin to exposure levels, which resulted in stomach findings in animals probably due to an antagonistic effect for the CCK2 receptor. Furthermore, it has been shown that a similar variability in exposure in patients is reduced by administering avatrombopag with food.</p><p>The absorption site of avatrombopag in the gastric system was investigated in rat. Apparently duodenum is the site of absorption for the majority of the dose administered followed by jejunum. The stomach was the site of least absorption.</p><p>In a study, in which radioactive labeled avatrombopag was dosed to Fischer rats by the oral route of administration, it was shown that the majority of radioactivity circulating in plasma is unchanged parent compound (75% of radioactive AUC 0-inf ).</p><p>Assessment report EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 Page 26/123</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Absorption -Repeat-dose PK</head><p>Repeat-dose pharmacokinetics were obtained from toxicokinetics at much higher doses than clinically relevant and the doses used in the single dose pharmacokinetic studies. Avatrombopag is not pharmacologically active in either of the nonclinical species and the evaluated toxicity is therefore off-target toxicity.</p><p>Plasma concentrations of avatrombopag were also determined in NOD/SCID mice transplanted with human bone marrow cells after once daily oral dose of avatrombopag for 14 days at the pharmacological effective dose of 1 mg/kg. After the final dose, unbound (free form) plasma concentration of avatrombopag reached the maximum level at 8 hours postdose, and C max and AUC (0-24) were 29.5 ng/mL and 430.5 ng·h/mL, respectively. Protein binding was estimated to 89-90%, hence plasma concentration was in this study similar to clinical relevant pharmacological active concentrations (approximately 200 ng/mL).</p><p>Repeat-dose toxicokinetics in mouse was reported from a 5-day (320-1280 mg/kg/day, only males) and a 13-week study (80-320 mg/kg/day). TK in the 5-day study was characterised by nonlinear kinetics with lower dose normalised AUC for higher doses, indicating saturation of absorption at doses &gt;320 mg/kg/day, as TK was approximately linear with dose in the 13 week-study. Terminal half-life was determined to be in the range of 3.3 to 15 h indicating high variability in absorption. Male mice showed greater exposure than female mice in the 13-week study (28-38%). This is considered to be incidental.</p><p>No signs of accumulation was observed in the 13-week study. Mean AUC tau in male mice at Day 90 for the lowest dose of 80 mg/kg/day was 182,000 ng/mL*h, 38 times higher than clinically relevant (approximately 4800 ng/mL*h).</p><p>Repeat-dose toxicokinetics in rat was evaluated in two 13-week studies (5-80 mg/kg/day or 80-320 mg/kg/day) and in one study of 26 weeks (20-160 mg/kg/day) duration. All three studies were characterised by a less than dose-proportional increase in exposure and consistently higher exposure in female compared to male rats (up to 60%). Slight accumulation was observed in the 13-week study of the low dose range and up to 3-4 fold in the high dose range 13-week study. In the 26-week study, accumulation was reported not to be higher than 2.4 from Day 1 to Day 183. Terminal half-life was reported for steady state in the two 13-week study to be in the range of 4.9 to 14 hours. Mean AUC tau in female rats on Day 183 for the lowest dose in the 26-week study was 79,600 ng/mL*h, 17 times higher than clinically relevant.</p><p>Repeat-dose toxicokinetics in dog was evaluated in a 4-week study of 4 dose levels in the range of 10 to 300 mg/kg/day. In contrast to rat, there was no sign of sex-difference in exposure. However, also in dog, exposure increased in a less than dose-proportional manner on Day 1. On Day 27, dose-normalised exposure is lowest for the mid-dose 100 mg/kg/day indicating accumulation of avatrombopag for the highest dose of 300 mg/kg/day in the dog and possibly saturation of clearance mechanism or toxicity in clearing organ(s). The dog was found susceptible to the counter-ion of avatrombopag causing kidney tubular necrosis, as the only nonclinical species. Therefore, the sign of accumulation of avatrombopag is not considered to be of concern for humans. Studies in dog of longer duration was not submitted. Mean (male/female) exposure of AUC tau at the lowest dose at steady state was 13,200 ng/mL*h, 2.8 times higher than clinically relevant. Mean AUC tau (male/female) at the highest dose showing up &gt;3 times accumulation after 28 days was 376,000 ng/mL*h, 78 times higher than clinically relevant.</p><p>Repeat-dose toxicity in monkey was evaluated in a 13-week study (1-15 mg/kg/day) and in a 52-week study (5-45 mg/kg/day). In the 13-week study no sex-difference in exposure was found, however in the 52-week study, males showed slightly higher exposure than females (up to 48%). In light of the high variability, this could be incidental. Exposure (AUC tau ) showed signs of higher than dose-proportionality at all sampling times (Day 1, 90, 181, 364, most pronounced at 5 and 15 mg/kg/day, probably due to limited absorption for the highest dose of 45 mg/kg/day. Accumulation was evaluated on Day 181 to be in the Assessment report EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 Page 27/123 range of 2 to 7-fold and did not increase at Day 364. Mean AUC tau for male at Day 364 for the lowest dose was 3.9 times higher than clinically relevant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distribution</head><p>The distribution of 14 C-avatrombopag at a pharmacological relevant dose of 1 mg/kg was evaluated in an ADME study in both albino (F344/DuCrj) and pigmented rats (Long Evans). At t max , plasma concentration was 74.5 ng eq./mL and 284 ng eq./mL in albino and pigmented rats, respectively. The higher concentration of avatrombopag in pigmented rats was consistent across tissues. These differences could be due to the high variability in pharmacokinetics and exposure of avatrombopag in animals and even patients.</p><p>In albino rats, at plasma t max of 1 hour, avatrombopag related radioactivity was found to be most abundant in stomach&gt;liver&gt;adrenal gland&gt;small intestine&gt;kidney&gt;heart&gt;submandibular gland&gt;lung.</p><p>For all these tissues, the radioactivity was lower at 24 hours compared to 1 or 4 hours. In tissues of fat, harderian gland and testis, radioactivity was only declining slowly or not at all between 4 and 24 hours.</p><p>In pigmented rats, at 1 hour (plasma t max is 4 hours), avatrombopag related radioactivity was found to be most abundant in liver&gt;small intestine&gt;stomach&gt;adrenal gland&gt;kidney&gt;heart&gt;submandibular &gt;lung.</p><p>For all these tissues, the radioactivity was lower at 24 hours compared to 1 or 4 hours. In tissues of eye ball and testis, radioactivity was only declining slowly between 4 and 24 hours. Hence the distribution of radioactivity related to avatrombopag was similar between albino and pigmented rat, except for the slower decline in concentration in eyeball of pigmented rat. This was further evaluated by determining radioactivity for up to 672 hours after dosing. The half-life of radioactivity was 351 hours in the eyeball.</p><p>This finding was followed up upon in a dedicated phototoxicity study, which did not reveal any toxicity for doses up to 300 mg/kg avatrombopag. Testis did not seem to be affected in rat by up to 80 mg/kg/day of avatrombopag in the 90 days toxicity study.</p><p>Plasma protein binding was determined by ultracentrifugation in plasma of all nonclinical species and humans (ME03171). Plasma protein binding was found to be moderate in rodents and rabbit (87.2-92.0%) and higher in dog, monkey and human (96.3-97.9%). The binding was not concentration dependent in the range of 0.05 to 50 µg/mL. 14 C-Avatrombopag distribution into blood cells was evaluated in blood of all nonclinical species and humans (AE-7539-G). Blood to plasma ratio R B was not concentration dependent in the range of 50 to 5000 ng/mL. R B was similar in rodents, monkey and human (0.57 to 0.66), slightly lower in dog (0.51-0.52) and higher in rabbit (0.82-0.83).</p><p>Placental transfer was investigated after a single oral dose of 14C-avatrombopag (3 mg/kg) to pregnant SD rats (AE-7538-G). The ratios of radioactive concentrations to maternal plasma on Days 13 and 18 of pregnancy up to 24 hours post dose were evaluated.</p><p>It can be concluded that avatrombopag related radioactivity is lower in foetus compared to maternal plasma in all tissues (ratio 0.12-0.40), hence placental transfer is evident, although limited. CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 were found to be the main contributors to the CYP-mediated metabolism of avatrombopag in pooled human liver microsomes being responsible for 4-hydroxy cis metabolite and the 4 hydroxy trans metabolite, respectively. Formation of 3-hydroxyavatrombopag was minor in all incubation and the responsible metabolic enzyme was not identified. In vivo metabolism 14 C-avatrombopag (10 mg/kg) was administered to SD rats by the oral or the intravenous route. Analysis of bile samples revealed the presence of unchanged 14 C-avatrombopag and up to 26 quantifiable metabolites. The major radioactive metabolite in bile was M46 (avatrombopag taurine conjugate)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In vitro metabolism</head><p>following both dosing routes. This metabolite accounted for 2.25% and 11.6% of the radioactive dose in orally and intravenously dosed male rats, respectively.</p><p>Radioactivity excreted in faeces consisted of 3 metabolites (oral dose) or 2 metabolites (intravenous dose), in addition to unchanged parent drug. Unchanged parent, 14 C-avatrombopag, was the primary radiolabelled component in faeces and accounted for 68.0 and 8.30% of the radioactivity in orally and intravenously dosed male BDC rats, respectively. Analysis of urine found up to 31 quantifiable metabolites, each representing no more than 0.16 and 0.48% of the dose following oral or intravenous dosing, respectively. No unchanged parent was detected in urine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CYP induction</head><p>Avatrombopag was incubated with hepatocytes from 3 different donors at concentrations from 1 to 20 µmol/L for three days by daily addition of avatrombopag. mRNA from individual CYPs was extracted from incubations and quantified vs vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or positive controls. The most prominent results obtained was that avatrombopag appeared to induce CYP3A4, however to a lesser degree than the positive control and inhibit the formation of mRNA of CYP1A2 at the highest dose down to 12% of vehicle control. This inhibition seemed to be dose-related. Classical CYP inhibition studies showed no potential for inhibition of CYP1A2 and treatment is only for 5 days, hence if a down regulation does happen in vivo, it will only be temporary and likely not clinically relevant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CYP inhibition</head><p>Avatrombopag potential for CYP inhibition was evaluated using recombinant CYP isoforms or pooled human liver microsomes. No results indicated concerns for CYP inhibition by avatrombopag as all IC50s came out above 10 µmol/L. Avatrombopag did not show potential for time dependent inhibition of CYP2C9, 2D6 or 3A either.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Excretion into urine, bile and faeces</head><p>Two studies were conducted to evaluate excretion of radioactive labelled avatrombopag in rats. One study was dosing 1 mg/kg to rats by the oral route evaluating urine, faeces and bile. A second study of excretion of avatrombopag was evaluated by dosing 14 C-avatrombopag 10 mg/kg to rats by both the oral or intravenous route. Excretion into urine, bile and faeces was evaluated. This study confirmed results from the first study. Results from the second study showed that the main route of excretion after oral administration was faeces with 82.8% of the dose after 120 hours followed by bile and urine with 8.1 and 2.98%, respectively. The main route of excretion after the intravenous route was bile with 45.6% followed by faeces and urine with 11.1 and 3.66%, respectively. It should be noted here that the rats administered avatrombopag by the intravenous route was euthanized after 26 hours due to necrosis in tails, hence 35% of the radioactivity was still retained in the carcasses at end of study. Also, at least 11.1% of the dose was excreted into the gastrointestinal tract by non-biliary route(s).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Excretion into breast milk</head><p>14 C-Avatrombopag was dosed 3 mg/kg by the oral route of administration to lactating SD rats. The radioactive concentration profile in milk was similar to plasma, with an exposure ratio of avatrombopag related radioactivity (milk to plasma) of 0.94, indicating that avatrombopag is secreted into milk, however with no direct indication of accumulation. The major component of radioactivity in milk was avatrombopag.</p><p>Assessment report EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 Page 29/123</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacokinetic drug interactions</head><p>CYP inhibition and induction is presented above under metabolism.</p><p>Avatrombopag was evaluated for interaction with a range of efflux transporters. Avatrombopag was demonstrated to be a P-gp substrate, but not a substrate of BCRP, BSEP or MRP2. Avatrombopag was a weak inhibitor of P-gp (IC50 &gt; 30 micromolar), however IC50 for BCRP, BSEP and MRP2 were lower; 5.4, 2.7 and 6.7 micromolar, respectively. This finding is of no clinical relevance.</p><p>In one study, Avatrombopag was evaluated for being a substrate or an inhibitor of the transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3. Avatrombopag was apparently not a substrate of these transporters but may show inhibitory potential, since avatrombopag showed a weak inhibition of the transport of probe substrates for OATP1B1 (IC 50 : 22.1 µmol/L) and OCT2 (IC 50 &gt;30 µmol/L), and moderate to potent inhibition of the transport of probe substrates for OATP1B3 (IC 50 : 2.8 µmol/L), OAT1</p><p>(IC 50 : 0.7 µmol/L), and OAT3 (IC 50 : 0.2 µmol/L).</p><p>In another study, Avatrombopag was demonstrated not to be a substrate of OATP2B1 or OATP1A2, but showed inhibitory potential of OCT1 with IC50 of 2.09 micromolar. Inhibition of OCT1 could be one of the reasons for the nonlinear kinetics in repeat dose toxicity studies by inhibiting uptake in the liver and thereby delay elimination.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Single dose toxicity</head><p>The minimum lethal dose by a single oral dose was identified to be 1000 mg/kg in rats and greater than 2000 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys. In rats administered ≥1000 mg/kg dose, clinical signs preceding death included staggering gaits, decreased locomotor activity, soft faeces, and oligopnea. In cynomolgus monkeys, avatrombopag was tolerated at doses up to 2000 mg/kg with toxicologic changes including vomiting and soft stool.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeat dose toxicity</head><p>The primary toxicity of avatrombopag was identified as dose-related changes in the stomach in repeated-dose studies in mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys. The histologic change in the fundic glands of the stomach was characterized by primary degeneration of the glandular epithelium with a decrease in matured parietal cells, with accompanying regenerative epithelial hyperplasia particularly in mice, and atrophy of glandular mucosa without inflammatory responses in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. This effect was not associated with an inflammatory response or any evidence of erosion or ulcer formation.</p><p>These changes were also accompanied by decreases in the gastric acid output with accompanying elevation in intragastric pH and compensatory hypergastrinemia in all of these species. These stomach lesions were dose-, plasma concentration-, and duration-dependent.</p><p>Histologic changes in the stomach induced by avatrombopag were identified to be due to systemic rather than local exposures. The gastric changes showed a clear trend towards recovery after dosing was stopped. Systemic exposures at no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) in all of the pivotal studies were sufficiently above the clinical exposures at the maximum recommended human dose under the intended clinical regimen.</p><p>Reversible skeletal muscle degeneration/necrosis was observed in F344 rats (but not in SD rats) and cynomolgus monkeys. However, these findings were not consistent and limited to the short duration (up to 4 weeks) studies, with no lesions observed in any species that received avatrombopag for 13 weeks and longer, even though skeletal muscles were examined extensively with additional tissue collection Assessment report EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 Page 30/123 from multiple sites with additional parameters in biochemistry in mice, SD rats, dogs, and monkeys.</p><p>There have been no adverse events that indicate skeletal muscle effects in clinical studies. These results indicate that avatrombopag is unlikely to pose any risk of skeletal muscle toxicity in humans.</p><p>In dogs, reversible renal toxicity was observed at high doses in the kidney in 4-week repeated-dose study. The changes included increases in BUN, creatinine, urinary protein, and urinary volume, decreased glomerular filtration rate and effective plasma flow, accompanied by histologic changes (epithelial cell regeneration of proximal tubules). In the dog, it may be possible that maleic acid, the salt moiety of avatrombopag which is known to cause similar lesions in dogs (tubular necrosis in proximal tubules), could have played a role in these renal changes since dogs are known to be susceptible to maleic acids <ref type="bibr">(Everett, et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fiume, 2007)</ref>. No renal changes were seen in the repeated-dose toxicity studies in mice, rats, or monkeys, and there have been no significant adverse events in kidneys and renal functions in clinical studies.</p></div>

The 2000 mg/kg dose group was excluded from data evaluation because of the death of 1 of the 5 females before the second administration. TK analysis was performed. Bone marrow collected at 24 hours after the final administration of avatrombopag was examined for determination of incidences of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCEs) and the percentage of polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) in the total erythrocytes. There was no avatrombopag-induced increase in the incidences of MNPCEs or percentage of PCEs at up to the maximum 100 mg/kg for males and 600 mg/kg for females.

Additional rats (24/sex/group, 3/sex/group/timepoint) were administered avatrombopag in the same manner for TK analysis. There were no deaths, avatrombopag-related clinical signs, or significant changes in blood chemistry, gross pathology, or mean kidney and liver weights. There were lower body weight gains with lower food intake at avatrombopag doses ≥600 mg/kg. In histology, gastric mucosal changes similar to those observed in adults were observed at doses ≥100 mg/kg. There were dose-dependent red blood cell parameter alterations indicative of iron deficiency anaemia at avatrombopag doses ≥300 mg/kg; these are known to be associated with the gastric changes in juvenile rats. There was also an increase in the incidence and/or severity of background basophilic renal tubules at the 1000 mg/kg avatrombopag dose. No test article-related changes were observed at 10 mg/kg of avatrombopag. Systemic avatrombopag exposure increased less than dose-proportionally with doses from 10 to 1000 mg/kg, and was generally similar over the 300 to 1000 mg/kg/ range. In general, there were no sex differences in AUC(0-last), although exposure in females was slightly higher. Exposure was generally higher on PND34 in animals at the 600 and 1000 mg/kg avatrombopag doses.</p></div>

In contrast, no histologic changes were observed with an oral avatrombopag dose of 20 mg/kg that resulted in the lowest level of systemic exposure.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.6.">Discussion on non-clinical aspects</head><p>A range of in vitro pharmacology studies have been conducted to characterise receptor binding and pharmacological activity. Avatrombopag appears to stimulate cell proliferation via the thrombopoietin receptor (c-Mpl) and differentiation of megakaryocytes from Human CB CD34+ Cells, but avatrombopag did not affect the differentiation of non-megakaryocytic lineages human hematopoietic progenitor cells.</p><p>Suggesting that avatrombopag stimulates human hematopoietic progenitor cells to specifically differentiate into megakaryocytes. Furthermore, avatrombopag appears to stimulate maturation of megakaryocytes in a similar degree as rhTPO with regards to ploidy level. Avatrombopag and TPO appears to have an additive effect in G-CSF-mobilized human PB CD34 + cells when giving avatrombopag in combination with 3 nmol/L rhTPO.</p><p>Limited in vivo studies have been conducted as avatrombopag appears only to be pharmacological active in humans and chimpanzees. Avatrombopag does not stimulate platelet production in mice, rats, monkeys, or dogs because of the unique TPO receptor specificity. Therefore, data from these animal studies do not fully model potential adverse effects related to platelet count increases due to avatrombopag in humans. Safety pharmacology has been addressed in classical in vitro studies as well as in vivo studies dogs and rats.</p><p>Avatrombopag was shown to bind to c-Mpl on human platelets without affecting rhTPO binding to c-Mpl on human platelets. Investigation of binding site of avatrombopag indicate that avatrombopag binds to CRH2 and/or ICD whereas TPO is known to bind to the CRH1 domain of c-Mpl. Thus, supporting that avatrombopag does not affect binding of TPO to c-Mpl. Further investigation of binding site of avatrombopag revealed that binding might be related to the transmembrane part of c-Mpl. This supports the finding of a very species specific pharmacological effect as the transmembrane part of c-Mpl is only conserved between Chimpanzee and humans among the tested species as His 499 only exists in humans and chimpanzees but not in other species.</p><p>No non-clinical data was provided on the evaluation of avatrombopag for interaction with IFN-alfa and IFN-gamma receptors. The argumentation being that interferon is not a standard therapy for hepatitis C infection any longer, as also supported e.g. by the EASL Recommendations on Treatment of Hepatitis C (2018). Therefore it is acceptable that no further investigations pertaining to the interaction of avatrombopag with interferon preparations are undertaken. However, it is conceivable that patients could be prescribed interferon for reasons other than ribavirin treatment, therefore a warning statement was included into section 4.4 of the SmPC.</p><p>The effect of avatrombopag on hERG Potassium Currents is not considered clinical relevant as the steady state plasma concentration in patients is expected to be 0.3µmol/L. Avatrombopag induced no changes in any parameters up to the highest concentration (1.37 μmol/L) tested, when investigating effects on action potentials by the glass microelectrode technique using isolated guinea pig papillary muscles.</p><p>Cardiovascular and respiratory safety pharmacology was studied in dogs, where avatrombopag appeared to have no effect. Central nervous system safety pharmacology was studied in rats and no changes were seen with avatrombopag. Renal safety pharmacology was studied in dogs. Avatrombopag at the highest dose (300 mg/kg) induced functional effects in the kidneys, which was not seen at 30mg/kg. The exposure seen at 30mg/kg (AUC 43.736 ng·h/mL) is approximate 9 times higher than the human exposure seen at 60mg dose (AUC 4820 ng·h/mL).</p><p>No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been conducted with avatrombopag. The lack of pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies is acceptable, as the most relevant interaction is considered to be with rhTPO and this has been addressed in the primary pharmacodynamics studies.</p><p>A comprehensive range of studies were conducted to characterise the pharmacokinetics and ADME properties of avatrombopag. This was done using validated bioanalytical methods for quantitative determination of "cold" and radioactive labelled avatrombopag. In vitro metabolism, induction and inhibition potential of avatrombopag was thoroughly investigated using systems of microsomes, primary hepatocytes and cell lines expressing human CYPs or transporters.</p><p>Avatrombopag appeared to induce CYP3A4, however to a lesser degree than the positive control and inhibit the formation of mRNA of CYP1A2 at the highest dose down to 12% of vehicle control. This inhibition seemed to be dose-related. Classical CYP inhibition studies showed no potential for inhibition of CYP1A2 and treatment is only for 5 days, hence if a down regulation does happen in vivo, it will only be temporary and likely not clinically relevant.</p><p>No results indicated concerns for CYP inhibition by avatrombopag as all IC50s came out above 10 µmol/L. Avatrombopag was apparently not a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3 transporters but may show inhibitory potential, since avatrombopag showed a weak inhibition of the transport of probe substrates for OATP1B1 and OCT2, and moderate to potent inhibition of the transport of probe substrates for OATP1B3, OAT1 and OAT3 (IC 50 : 0.2 µmol/L). In SmPC section 5.2, avatrombopag is described as being an inhibitor of OAT1 and OAT3 in vitro.</p><p>Avatrombopag was demonstrated not to be a substrate of OATP2B1 or OATP1A2, however showed inhibitory potential of OCT1. Inhibition of OCT1 could be one of the reasons for the nonlinear kinetics in repeat dose toxicity studies by inhibiting uptake in the liver and thereby delay elimination. However, inhibition of OCT1 is not expected to occur in patients, since IC 50 is well above clinical relevant plasma concentrations (total concentration).</p><p>Overall the toxicology studies are not able to predict risks related to the pharmacological effect of avatrombopag as avatrombopag appears only to be pharmacologically active in humans and chimpanzee. This is a limitation to the nonclinical packaged, but it is accepted as no nonclinical models are available that could be used (toxicologic evaluation in chimpanzees is not viable for ethical reasons based on EU Directive 2010/63/EU). The off-target effects of avatrombopag have been investigated in species commonly used in toxicology studies, including mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys. From all species tested, rats and monkeys were found to be the most sensitive, and these 2 species were, therefore, used for the chronic toxicology studies.</p><p>All pivotal toxicology studies were performed in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations.</p><p>Avatrombopag was administered orally, which is the intended route for clinical use (except for the local tolerance studies and 1 mechanistic study for gastric toxicity in rats).</p><p>Repeated dose toxicology studies have been conducted in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys. However, the rat and the monkey was the main toxicological species. The repeated dose toxicity studies are all conducted in species where avatrombopag is not pharmacological active. Overall, there were two avatrombopag related findings of importance.</p><p>The primary finding was dose-related changes in the stomach in repeated-dose studies in mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys. The histologic changes in the fundic glands of the stomach were characterised by primary degeneration of the glandular epithelium with a decrease in matured parietal cells, with accompanying regenerative epithelial hyperplasia particularly in mice, and atrophy of glandular mucosa without inflammatory responses in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. These stomach lesions were dose-, plasma concentration-, and duration-dependent. The findings are considered human relevant as they were seen across more species. The lowest safety margins were seen in the 52 week study in monkeys with a safety margin of 3. The changes appeared to be reversible in monkeys and rats.</p><p>Alterations in blood cell parameters were apparent as relatively mild thrombocytopenia in F344 and SD rats, mild lymphocytopenia in male Beagle dogs and slight anaemic changes in female cynomolgus monkeys.</p><p>Skeletal muscle changes were also observed, but only in F344 rats and cynomolgus monkeys. Moreover, these findings were reversible and limited to the short duration (up to 4 weeks) studies and in clinical studies there have been no adverse events that indicate skeletal muscle abnormalities. All these results indicate that avatrombopag is unlikely to pose any risk of skeletal muscle toxicity in humans.</p><p>In dogs renal toxicity was observed. The renal findings were characterised by regeneration of tubules, and cast formation in tubules as well as degeneration/necrosis of tubules, vacuolar degeneration of tubules and dilatation of tubules. The renal findings appear to be reversible and with a safety margin of 7. The renal finding in dogs might be related to maleic acid, the salt moiety of avatrombopag.</p><p>Avatrombopag appears not to be genotoxic in all bacterial strains tested (Salmonella typhimurium TA100, TA1535, TA98, and TA1537 and Escherichia coli WP2 uvrA[pKM101]) either in the presence or absence of S9 mix. It is noted that precipitation was seen at doses of 78.1 µg/plate and the relevance of higher concentrations is unknown. Avatrombopag tested negative in both an in vitro chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes and in vivo micronucleus assay in rats.</p><p>Malignant neuroendocrine cell tumours were seen in both mice (mid and high dose) and rats (high dose)</p><p>with exposure multiples to human exposure of 14 and 48, respectively, for the doses with no neoplastic changes. The neoplastic changes seen in the carcinogenicity studies are most likely related to the antisecretory properties of avatrombopag resulting in nongenotoxic and rodent-specific neoplastic changes. Overall, the safety margins for carcinogenicity are considered adequate, especially considering the 5-day treatment regimen in patients.</p><p>Avatrombopag appears to have no effect on male and female fertility or early embryogenesis in rats.</p><p>There were no embryo-fetal effects in rats or rabbits that were administered avatrombopag during organogenesis. PPND studies in rats showed reduced postnatal survival when pups were exposed to avatrombopag. The findings were present at doses with no maternal toxicity. There were no effects on postnatal development. The NOAEL for the PPND study was set to 15mg/kg, which is approximately a 13 fold higher exposure than the clinically relevant exposure. Avatrombopag is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception (see SmPC).</p><p>A dose-range finding study was conducted in juvenile rats. The DRF study revealed avatrombopag related changes in the stomach at doses of ≥100 mg/kg. These findings were similar to the ones in the repeated dose toxicity studies.</p><p>Three mechanistic gastric toxicity studies were conducted to investigative the mechanism behind the gastric toxicity. One study was conducted in mice and two studies in rats. Findings were somewhat similar to the effects of Omeprazole. However, there were discrepancies. This indicates that the gastric toxicity might be linked to the reduced intragastric pH, which appears to be related to systemic exposure rather than local exposure.</p><p>No avatrombopag related reactions were seen in the skin irritation and ocular irritation studies.</p><p>Two impurities were found to be positive by an in silico method. On the basis of ICH M7 and Q3A, the risk of carcinogenicity by the specified impurities in avatrombopag API is considered to be negligible. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.7.">Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects</head><p>Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. The primary toxicity of avatrombopag in pivotal repeated dose studies was in the stomach at high doses with adequate safety margins when compared to the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose; these effects were reversible even in the chronic toxicity studies.</p><p>Overall, it is noted that avatrombopag is not pharmacologically active in any of the species used in the nonclinical studies and therefore the nonclinical package cannot predict the risks related to the pharmacological effect of avatrombopag. However, the non-clinical data submitted support the approval of avatrombopag.</p><p>The applicant is recommended to complete an OECD 308 study of aerobic transformation in freshwater aquatic sediment systems and OECD 305 fish bioaccumulation study, and submit an updated ERA.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GCP</head><p>The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.</p><p>The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. Overall, all PK and PK/PD models were validated and found to integrate data acceptably to permit predictions. One notable exception was the model to predict the effect of avatrombopag on the QTc interval. The PK/PD relationship for avatrombopag exposure and ddQTcF could not be adequately modelled and thus no credible modelling predictions regarding impact on the QTc interval could be made. In vivo interaction studies indicate that CYP2C9 is the primary enzyme involved in the metabolic clearance of avatrombopag while the contribution of CYP3A4 is minor.</p><p>Genetic polymorphism: Too few patients with poor metabolizer status with regard to CYP2C9 were included in clinical studies to permit conclusions regarding this polymorphism. No impact of genotype with regard to CYP3A5 was demonstrated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dose proportionality and time dependencies</head><p>Avatrombopag displayed dose proportionality across the tested dose range although a plateau of AUC and Cmax appeared to be reached at the supratherapeutic dose of 100 mg. Several studies have demonstrated both a high intra-and inter-individual variability when avatrombopag is administered in the fasted state. However, when administered in the fed state, both intra-and inter-individual variability was markedly reduced (by approx. 50%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacokinetics in target population</head><p>All Phase 1/2 studies were conducted in healthy adults but data from the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in CLD patients contributed data to the popPK analysis. In CLD patients, apparent plasma clearance, apparent volume of distribution and Tmax were unchanged irrespective of recommended dose (40 mg or 60 mg). AUC and Cmax displayed dose proportionality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special populations</head><p>Impaired renal function: Only 6% of orally administered avatrombopag was recovered in urine. Thus, renal impairment is unlikely to result in clinically relevant PK or PK/PD changes. Renal function studied by</p><p>Pop PK modelling and covariate analysis showed no effect in subjects with eGFR ≥29.9. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal insufficiency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impaired hepatic function:</head><p>The target population of avatrombopag consists of CLD patients. The popPK analysis found that subjects with CLD were a significant covariate with regard to apparent volume of distribution (V/F being approx. 65% higher in CLD subjects compared to healthy individuals) but not to apparent plasma clearance. The similar apparent plasma clearance means that total plasma exposure is similar between CLD patients and healthy subjects. The degree of hepatic impairment did not impact results in the majority of patients. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients irrespective of degree of hepatic impairment.</p><p>Race: Different race had no clinically relevant impact on PK parameters. PopPK and PK/PD analyses confirmed these findings as did efficacy analyses of the Phase 3 studies. No posology adjustments are recommended based on race.</p><p>Elderly, children, gender and body weight: The popPK analyses found that neither age or body weight nor gender influenced PK. This was further confirmed in a definitive population analysis. Body weight and CLD did have statistically significant impact on apparent volume of distribution. However, simulations showed that doubling of body weight had minimal impact on exposure and platelet count. The avatrombopag indication is only pursued in the adult population. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacokinetic interaction studies</head><p>Avatrombopag as perpetrator: Avatrombopag did not inhibit any of the major liver CYP isoenzymes in-vitro but was shown to be a weak inducer of CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C9. In-vitro studies showed avatrombopag was a weak OATP1B1 and OCT2 inhibitor, and a moderate to potent OATP1B3, OAT1 and OAT3 inhibitor.</p><p>Avatrombopag as prey: P-gp inhibitors do not affect avatrombopag PK and PD in a clinical relevant grade even though avatrombopag has been shown to be a substrate of P-gp. In healthy volunteers in a fasted state with the majority of subjects being extensive metabolizers of CYP2C9 and after a single 20 mg dose of avatrombopag, no detrimental effect on PK or PD was observed that would warrant a change in posology. However, PBPK/PD simulations of steady-state conditions in CLD subjects at clinically relevant doses of avatrombopag showed more profound effects of enzyme induction and inhibition on platelet counts. Effect of acid reducing agents: Avatrombopag is classified as a Class IV compound and practically insoluble in the pH range of 1 to 9. For this reason, evaluation of gastric effect solely by Pop PK covariate analysis is acceptable. The impact of acid reducing agents on avatrombopag PK studied by modelling and covariate analysis showed no effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.3.">Pharmacodynamics</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanism of action</head><p>Avatrombopag is an orally administered, small molecule (i.e. non-peptide) c-Mpl agonist that mimics the biologic effects of TPO, the physiologic regulator of platelet production, in vitro and in vivo. TPO exerts its effect on megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombocytopoiesis through binding and activation of the TPO receptor, which is expressed on haematopoietic stem cells, on cells of the megakaryocytic lineage, and on platelets. Avatrombopag activates human c-Mpl by binding to a different site on the TPO receptor than </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacodynamic interactions</head><p>The PK/PD model predicts comparable increases in the platelet count following avatrombopag administration irrespective of TPO level. This is considered supportive of the hypothesis generated during non-clinical development that avatrombopag may exert effect even in the event of high levels of endogenous TPO. Further, as similar platelet count increases are predicted irrespective of TPO level, the model supports that administration of avatrombopag even in the event of high levels of endogenous TPO has acceptable safety.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between plasma concentration and effect and dose selection rationale</head><p>An optimal dose regimen was achieved by Pop PK/PD modelling using the early Pop PK model with Phase 2 data and the 2G tablet formulation. The dose-response relation was shown to be dependent of baseline platelet count. Two dosing regimens were chosen for the Phase 3 studies in CLD subjects: 40 mg QD for 5 days with baseline platelet count from 40 to less than 50×10 9 /L and 60 mg QD for 5 days with baseline platelet count less than 40×10 9 /L. The clinical pharmacology data from patient studies support the proposed dose regimens. The rationale behind the clinical dose setting and dosing interval of 40 mg or 60 mg QD avatrombopag for 5 days is justified. Avatrombopag undergoes oxidative metabolism primarily via CYP2C9 with CYP3A4 playing a minor role.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.4.">Discussion on clinical pharmacology</head><p>Three identified metabolites are formed, one by glucuronidation (approx. 33.5%) and two by oxidation (approx. 43.8%). Further 3 unidentified peaks were detected in urine. Possible impact of genetic polymorphism has been investigated particularly with regard to CYP2C9 and CYP3A5. For CYP2C9, too few poor metabolizers were included in studies 018 and 019 to make conclusions regarding the impact of genotype on the extent of interaction. For CYP3A5, no impact of genotype on the extent of interaction was detected.</p><p>All Phase 1/2 studies were conducted in healthy adults. Linear PK was established across the intended therapeutic dose range. In CLD patients in Phase 2 and 3 studies, apparent plasma clearance, apparent volume of distribution and Tmax were unchanged irrespective of recommended dose (40 mg or 60 mg).</p><p>AUC and Cmax displayed dose proportionality. Thus, the PK in the target population is considered adequately investigated.</p><p>Special populations: The possible impact of renal impairment, hepatic impairment, race, gender, body weight and age was investigated in dedicated studies, in popPK and PK/PD models and in efficacy analyses of the Phase 3 studies. A warning to observe for both adequate as well as higher than anticipated increase in platelet count for patients with Child-Pugh score Class C has been included in the SmPC. Only 6% of orally administered avatrombopag was recovered in urine. Thus, renal impairment is unlikely to result in clinically relevant PK or PK/PD changes. PopPK analyses confirmed this. The target population of avatrombopag consists of CLD patients. The popPK analysis found that subjects with CLD were a significant covariate with regard to V/F (V/F being approx. 65% higher in CLD subjects compared to healthy individuals) but not to CL/F. The similar CL/F means that total plasma exposure is similar between CLD patients and healthy subjects. Three studies in Phase 1 investigated the impact of race (Chinese, Japanese, white). In study 006, following 10 mg and 40 mg single dose administrations, no PK differences between races were observed. Following 80 mg single dose (supra-therapeutic), mean exposure for Japanese subjects was lower as compared with Chinese and white subjects. Although 10 mg once daily multiple dose administration under fasting conditions yielded similar PK values across races, data indicated that the Chinese group had a lower AUC and platelet count than the Caucasian group at Day 7 (steady-state). However, this does not warrant a change in posology for the East Asian population based on adequate responses to this issue by the Applicant. It is noted that the variability of Cmax and AUC was high (&gt;70%) in study 006. Study 015 conducted only in Japanese subjects resulted in higher exposure across all tested doses as compared with study 006 but lacked a white cohort for comparison. Study 018 compared white and Japanese subjects using the planned commercial tablets (2G) of the recommended doses (40 mg and 60 mg). Results showed no difference in plasma exposure (AUC) and PD parameters between Japanese and white subjects, however Cmax was 20% higher in the Japanese group. PopPK and PK/PD analyses confirmed the findings as did efficacy analyses of the Phase 3 studies. The popPK analyses also found that neither age nor gender influenced PK. Body weight and CLD did, however, have statistically significant impact on apparent volume of distribution. Simulations showed that doubling of body weight had minimal impact on exposure and platelet count. Guidance to the prescribing physician regarding proper monitoring of increase of platelet count has been introduced in the SmPC. The avatrombopag indication is only pursued in the adult population. Overall, it is considered justified that no posology adjustments are recommended for special populations. Avatrombopag is a Class IV compound and practically insoluble in the pH range of 1 to 9 but a substrate of P-gp. For this reason, evaluation of gastic effect solely by popPK is considered acceptable.</p><p>Pharmacodynamics: The avatrombopag clinical pharmacology program in Phase 1 contributing PD data consisted of one single dose and one multiple dose PK study, three studies investigating the effect of intrinsic factors on PK and PD, and a thorough QT study. Further, PK data from the Phase 2 and 3 studies contributed PK data to the PK and PD models. The mechanism of action of avatrombopag being an activator of human c-Mpl by binding to a different site on the TPO receptor than TPO (as such, a TPO agonist) is adequately described.</p><p>The thorough QT study demonstrated no cardiovascular effects of avatrombopag. This was supported by observations from the Phase 3 studies. Non-clinical studies indicate that avatrombopag and rhTPO have additive effects with regard to increasing the number of megakaryocytes. The PK/PD model integrating data from Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies assess the effect of increasing TPO levels during concomitant avatrombopag administration. The model predicts comparable increases in platelet count irrespective of TPO level. Thus, the hypothesis that efficacy of avatrombopag is maintained even in the event of high TPO levels is confirmed while acceptable safety is also maintained. No genetic differences in PD response were detected. PK studies 001 and 002 confirmed dose proportionality between avatrombopag and mean change in platelet count. The Pop PK/PD model predicted that the dose-response relation between avatrombopag and final platelet count was dependent of baseline platelet count. Based on this, two different dosing regimens determined by baseline platelet count were chosen for the Phase 3 studies. The rationale behind these regimens is adequately described and supported by clinical pharmacology data from patient studies.</p><p>Overall, the clinical pharmacodynamics of avatrombopag are considered sufficiently described.</p></div>

Study drug was administered without regard to food in this study, and the scheduled procedure was to be performed within 1 to 4 days after the last dose of study drug.

For the primary efficacy endpoint analysis, all avatrombopag-treated subjects were pooled from Cohort A and Cohort B by dose and compared with the single pooled group of all placebo-treated subjects from the 2 cohorts. The Responder rate in the combined avatrombopag treatment group was higher (48.4%) compared to the combined placebo treatment group (8.1%) with a treatment difference (40.3%) that was highly significant (P&lt;0.0001).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample size</head><p>For both pivotal studies, the sample size was based on the comparison of the primary efficacy variable.</p><p>Based on clinical opinion and previous studies, the Sponsor assumed that the response rate in the placebo group would be 18 %. The effect on the treated group was estimated using the results from the Phase 2 study (E5501-G000-202) and dose-response modelling. Within each baseline platelet count cohort, a sample size of 100 randomized subjects, 67 subjects for avatrombopag and 33 subjects for placebo, would have greater than 90% power to detect an absolute difference of 35% between the avatrombopag response rate and the placebo response rate using Fisher's Exact tests with a 2-sided α=0.05. The sample size allowed for a 10% drop-out rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Randomisation</head><p>Eligible subjects were assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts according to their mean laseline platelet count, into either the low baseline platelet count cohort (&lt;40×10(9)/L) or the high baseline platelet count cohort (≥40 to &lt;50×10(9)/L). Within each Baseline platelet count cohort, subjects were further stratified by the risk of bleeding associated with their scheduled procedure (low, moderate, or high), and by the diagnosis of HCC status (yes, no). Neither of the baseline platelet cohorts was permitted to comprise greater than 55 % of the total number of subjects enrolled in the study. Regarding the proportion of risk bleeding procedures, it was planned that no fewer than 10% of subjects were enrolled into the high risk group and no more than 60% of subjects in the low risk group.</p><p>The randomization ratio was 2 (avatrombopag):1(placebo).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Blinding (masking)</head><p>During the Randomization Phase, subjects and all personnel involved with the conduct and the interpretation of the study, including investigators, site personnel, and sponsor staff were blinded to the treatment codes. Randomization data were kept strictly confidential, filed securely by an appropriate group at the sponsor, and accessible only to authorized persons (eg, Eisai Global Safety) until the time of unblinding, per SOPs. </p></div>

Due to the sample size, the results were pooled across centres.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition of analysis dataset</head><p>• Full Analysis Set (FAS): All subjects randomized into the study. This is the population used in the primary efficacy analysis.</p><p>• Per Protocol Analysis Set: All randomized subjects who received protocol assigned study drug and do not have major protocol deviations. This population is used in a sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint.</p><p>• Safety Analysis Set: All subjects who received at least a dose of study drug and have at least one post dose safety assessment. This population is used in the safety evaluations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calculations for the primary endpoint</head><p>The proportion of subjects without platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure for bleeding is analysed separately within each baseline platelet count cohort (&lt;40 × 10(9)/L or from 40 to &lt;50 × 10(9)/L) using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test adjusting for the risk of bleeding associated with the elective procedure (low, moderate, or high). Since the HCC status was included in the randomization stratification for safety purposes only, not for efficacy consideration, HCC is not included in the CMH model for the primary efficacy analysis.</p><p>The 95% CI for the proportion of subjects not requiring a platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure for bleeding is calculated for each treatment group within each baseline platelet count cohort. In addition, the 95% CI for the difference between avatrombopag and matching placebo is also provided within each baseline platelet count cohort using normal approximation method.</p><p>Missing values are considered as non-responders.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.3.">Discussion on clinical efficacy Design and conduct of clinical studies</head><p>Avatrombopag is a new, oral TPO-receptor agonist (TPO-RA), developed for the use in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) before a scheduled, invasive procedure, which may cause bleeding.</p><p>Thrombocytopenia and other disturbances in the coagulation system are frequently observed in this patient population. Thrombocytopenia &lt; 50 in CLD is due to the insufficient TPO production, signalling to and stimulation of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. The incidence of thrombocytopenia &lt;50 x 10(9)/L, which is a cut-off value considered in most diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, is related to the extent of liver disease. SOC to prevent bleeding in planned procedures involves in particular the use of platelet transfusions, which may be ineffective, cause complications and is dependent on blood donor activity.</p><p>The two dosing regimens used in the pivotal phase III studies (Study 310 and Study 311) were based on the subjects' Baseline platelet count, and were selected based on PK/PD modeling of phase II data.</p><p>Subjects with a Baseline platelet count of less than 40×10 9 /L were assigned to the Low Baseline Platelet Count Cohort and received 60 mg of avatrombopag once daily for 5 days, and subjects with a Baseline platelet count of 40 to less than 50×10 9 /L were assigned to the High Baseline Platelet Count Cohort and received 40 mg of avatrombopag once daily for 5 days. Five to 8 days after the last dose of avatrombopag (on Study Day 10 to 13), each subject underwent a scheduled procedure.</p><p>The two pivotal studies (trial 310 and 311) were identical in design as randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global, parallel-group studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily avatrombopag for the treatment of adults with thrombocytopenia associated with liver disease prior to an elective procedure. Study 310 included 231 patients, study 311 included 204 patients. Because dosing is related to baseline platelet count, and patients with moderate thrombocytopenia have not been treated, which is evident from the results of screen-failures, the cut-off value reflects the investigated population.</p><p>The Applicant presented more safety information and rationale to aim for a broad indication, not restricting treatment with avatrombopag to specific subgroups of patients with CLD . The wording of Section 4.1 was amended to "treatment of severe thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic liver disease undergoing a scheduled invasive procedure." Additionally, the exclusion criterion #3 on portal vein velocity should be used as a recommended screening tool to prevent portal thrombosis. The exclusion of 9.3% of patients by this parameter is reflected as an identified important risk in the RMP.</p><p>The in-and exclusion criteria pose some problems to handle, because a (minor) group of patients with CLD and a history of concomitant hepatic vascular affection and a (very large) group of patients with a previous history of any vascular manifestation, not related to present CLD, have not been included in the protocols. It is rational that the risk for thrombosis is increased in patients with present partial or complete occlusion in the hepatic circulation, and that any thrombosis-prophylaxis must be stopped.</p><p>However, a patient treated for a vascular event years before, without hepatic involvement and now thrombocytopenic may not be treated. The safety issue is highly prioritised for avatrombopag treatment.</p><p>The treatment in a RCT with a new TPO-agonist may probably cause thrombotic events in some patients, unless measures to mitigate this risk were preplanned. From the screen-failure registration it is evident that only 2.1% met exclusion criteria 1 (any history of arterial or venous thrombosis, including both partial or complete) and 5.3% met exclusion criteria 2 (evidence of thrombosis, partial or complete) in the main portal vein branches etc). The last circumstance justifies the precaution to perform a Doppler scan of the portal vein flow (not to be less than 10 cm/sec), the first precaution was due to theunderstandable -aim to provide a true assessment of the thromboembolic potential of the IMP, and not to confound it with other contributing factors.</p><p>Patients were stratified according to the anticipated bleeding risk of the procedure and the platelet count, reflecting an overall assessment of the clinical risk. Patients were included only with a MELD score ≤24, which restricts patients classified by this score, but still allowed patients by any Child-Pugh class to be included, because the two classifications are based on different parameters. The rationale to use MELD and not Child-Pugh classification in the inclusion is accepted due to the prognostic impact by higher MELD scores in the setting of a RCT. The available efficacy and safety data demonstrated the consistency of the avatrombopag treatment effect with varying degrees of hepatic impairment, and support the proposed inclusion of patients with MELD scores &gt;24 into the label. However as requested, the applicant has included patients with MELD scores &gt;24 as missing information in the RMP.</p><p>Patient randomization and flow of patients is satisfactory, and 91-97% of patients (presented according to base-line platelet count) completed the study. The primary endpoint was defined as the proportion of subjects who did not require a platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure for bleeding after randomization and up to 7 days following a scheduled procedure. This outcome measure is considered clinically relevant, as it does not focus on laboratory values but on the avoidance of platelet transfusions and the clinically evident need for the treatment of a bleeding event.</p><p>Protocol deviations occurred in both studies, registered as 24.2% (310) and 18.1% (311) being major protocol deviations and raise a concern. Most frequently deviations were due to subjects receiving platelet transfusion despite having a significant increase in platelet count, and subjects who did not have a clinically significant increase in platelet count from baseline to procedure day having, at the investigator's discretion, the scheduled procedure without a pre-procedural platelet transfusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy data and additional analyses</head><p>The primary efficacy endpoint in both pivotal phase 3 studies is a way to translate the effect of an increase in platelet production (and count) to the benefit for the patient in reducing transfusion need and risk of bleeding. Responders were defined as subjects who did not require a platelet transfusion or rescue procedure for bleeding. Bleeding risk related to procedures was defined. The increase in platelet count was the first secondary endpoint, and the term responder defined if the patient achieved the target platelet count of greater than or equal to 50×10(9)/L on procedure Day (Day 10 to Day 13).</p><p>Primary efficacy analyses using the FAS from each of the individual Phase 3 studies, and reproducible between the 310 and 311, as well as the pooled FAS, demonstrated a greater proportion of responders in the avatrombopag groups than in the respective placebo treatment groups in both baseline platelet count cohorts. In the pooled FAS, the proportion of responders in the low baseline platelet count cohort (&lt;40×10(9)/L) was higher, 66.9% (107/160 subjects) in the 60 mg avatrombopag treatment group compared to 28.6% (26/91 subjects) in the placebo treatment group. The results demonstrate that 38.3% (95% CI [26.5, 50.1]) more patients responded. Similarly in the high baseline platelet count cohort (≥40 to &lt;50×10(9)/L), the proportion of subjects not requiring a platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure for bleeding was 88.0% (103/117 subjects), for the 40 mg avatrombopag treatment group compared to 35.8% (24/67 subjects) in the placebo treatment group. The treatment difference in the proportion of responders was 52.2% (95% CI [39.3, 65.1]). The effect is highly statistical significant and clinical meaningful. It is acceptable that a relatively high proportion of placebo patients may be assessed as responders, and more in the high baseline platelet group, because it reflects the study design, fluctuations in platelet counts and the circumstances in the context of a bleeding risk-related procedure. The assessment by the treating specialist should be in accordance with study synopsis.</p><p>Therefore, it was important that the pivotal trials (as well as the two supportive) were blinded. The effect demonstrated by the primary endpoint was supported by results presented in secondary endpoints.</p><p>Although Forest plot analysis demonstrate a beneficial effect across age, sex, ethnicity, platelet count, bleeding risk, cause of chronic liver disease, and MELD score, the subgroup analysis also disclosed a vulnerable group of CLD patients. Forest plot analysis indicates that patients in Child-Pugh class C, with a platelet count &lt;40 and scheduled for a procedure, did not have any effect of avatrombopag treatment by 60 mg QD in five days, nor did the patients achieve an increase in platelets on procedure day &gt;50. It is accepted, however that the subgroup analysis demonstrates efficacy across Child-Pugh classes and MELD scores, including a positive Forest plot in the Child-Pugh Class C overall and that patients numbers are small which hampers the reliability of the analysis. Taken together with the safety report documentation, and the medical need in particular in this subgroup of CLD patients with severe thrombocytopenia, the indication is not restricted to a sub-class of patients. Furthermore, the target patient population is expected to undergo multiple invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures during their course of illness.

In the pooled analysis, 148 (54.0%) of 274 patients in the combined avatrombopag group and 86 (55.1%) of 156 patients in the combined placebo group had one or more adverse events.</p><p>Assessment report EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 Page 99/123</p><p>The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) in at least 5% of subjects in the pooled avatrombopag or placebo treatment group were pyrexia (9.9% in the avatrombopag group versus 9.0% in the placebo group), abdominal pain (6.6% versus 6.4%), nausea (6.6% versus 7.1%) and headache (5.5% versus 6.4%). No adverse events occurring in ≥ 3% of subjects had a ≥ 2% higher incidence in the avatrombopag group than in the placebo group. Most of the adverse events were of mild severity and considered unrelated to avatrombopag. CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were reported in 28 (10.2%) of 274 patients in the combined avatrombopag treatment group and in 15 (9.6%) of 156 patients in the combined placebo group. The majority of individual Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs in Group 1 were reported in only 1 subject each. Adverse events considered treatment-related were reported for 26 (9.5%) patients in the avatrombopag group and 20 (12.8%) patients in the placebo group. The most frequently reported treatment-related AEs in the combined avatrombopag group were headache (1.8% in the avatrombopag group versus 4.5% in the placebo group), nausea (1.8% versus 1.9%), fatigue (1.5% versus 1.3%), dizziness (1.1% versus 1.3%), bone pain (0.7% versus 0%), diarrhoea (0.7% versus 1.9%), and pyrexia (0.7% versus 0.6%).</p><p>In general, the reported TEAEs are considered to be consistent with the underlying medical condition of the study population and the invasive procedures.

However, the incidence of Grade 3-5 TEAEs in study 310 was inconsistent between the treatment groups in the two baseline platelet count cohorts. While the incidence of Grade 3-5 TEAEs was lower in the avatrombopag 60 mg group compared to placebo (7.9% avatrombopag 60 mg versus 16.7% placebo), a higher incidence has been observed in the avatrombopag 40 mg group compared to the placebo group (17.2% in the avatrombopag 40 mg group compared to none in placebo). The Applicant has provided a discussion concerning the inconsistency of the incidence of Grade 3-5 TEAEs between the treatment groups of the two baseline platelet count cohorts of study 310.</p><p>While the incidence of Grade 3-5 TEAEs was lower in the avatrombopag 60 mg group compared to placebo, a higher incidence has been observed in the avatrombopag 40 mg group compared to placebo.</p><p>However, none of the reported Grade 3-5 TEAEs in the 40 mg avatrombopag group occurred in more than one subject.

The applicant clarified that the demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable between the baseline platelet count cohorts and thus would not explain the observed differences between the treatment groups. Additionally, in the identically designed phase 3 study 311, the incidence of Grade 3-5 TEAEs was comparable between the treatment groups of both baseline platelet count cohorts. Although the provided discussion does not satisfactorily explain the reported higher incidence of Grade 3-5 TEAEs in the 40 mg avatrombopag group compared to placebo, it did not raise any new safety concerns.</p><p>The Grade 3-4 TEAE of neutrophil count decrease was reported as occurring more frequently in the combined avatrombopag group compared to placebo (1.5% [4/274 subjects] in the avatrombopag versus 0% in the placebo group). The Applicant submitted brief narrative descriptions including a timeline overview of the neutrophil count for each of the four subjects who experienced the Grade 3 or 4 TEAE of neutrophil count decrease.Review of the individual case reports revealed that in each of these patients a low neutrophil count was noted prior to the initiation of avatrombopag administration either at the time of the screening visit (day -11) or at baseline (day 1). The neutrophil count did not worsen on avatrombopag treatment and remained low or slightly increased throughout the study. The temporal relationship of this TEAE do not support a causal relationship between the adverse event of decreased neutrophil count and treatment with avatrombopag.</p><p>The applicant evaluated fatigue, portal vein thrombosis, bone pain and pyrexia to be stated in the tabulated list of adverse events in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Inclusion of these adverse events was justified by the argument that they were reported in 2 or more subjects and occurred more frequently in the avatrombopag group compared to placebo. However, although anaemia and myalgia were judged as being related to study treatment and occurred more frequently in the avatrombopag arm compared to placebo, they were not included in the tabulated list of adverse events due to the fact that they were only reported in a single avatrombopag-treated subject. The applicant argued that only 1/10 of the anaemias and 1/2 of the myalgias were assessed as treatment-related and thus a causal relationship is not suspected. However, anaemia and myalgia have been reported as frequently occurring treatment-related AEs in patients treated with other approved TPO receptor agonists like eltrombopag and romiplostin.</p><p>Additionally, according to the SmPC guideline, all adverse events at least possibly related to the investigational drug, based for example on their comparative incidence in clinical trials, should be included in the tabulated list of section 4.8. Low frequency of an adverse reaction is not a justification for deletion. Thus, anaemia and myalgia have been included in section 4.8.</p></div>

The most frequently reported adverse events in the total avatrombopag or placebo treatment groups were nausea (7.8% in the avatrombopag group versus 7.8% in the placebo group), pyrexia (7.6% versus 9.3%), headache (6.3% versus 7.4%), and abdominal pain (5.6% versus 6.9%).</p><p>The subject incidence of adverse events considered by an investigator to be potentially treatment-related was 14.4% in the combined avatrombopag group and 15.2% in the placebo group. The most frequently reported treatment-related AEs in the combined avatrombopag and placebo group were nausea (2.8% in the avatrombopag group versus 2.9% in the placebo group), headache (2.5% versus 5.4%), fatigue (2.3% versus 1.0%), and dizziness (1.5% versus 2.0%). The reported AEs in the pooled analysis of group 2 reveal a similar pattern to that reported in group 1 and indicates a high background incidence of AEs caused by the underlying disease and the type of invasive procedures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Group 3</head><p>The Group 3 safety analysis set includes four clinical studies in patients with thrombocytopenia and CLD (Group 2) and one study in subjects with thrombocytopenia and hepatitis C receiving antiviral therapy.</p><p>Because of the different safety profile expected for subjects with thrombocytopenia and hepatitis C receiving antiviral therapy (study 203), compared to those subjects with thrombocytopenia and CLD enrolled in Group 2, the safety results from Study 203 were not pooled.</p><p>During the A1 Period (21 days of study treatment and prior to treatment with antivirals) of study 203, 21 (3/17) subjects in the placebo treatment group. The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs were nausea and fatigue in the avatrombopag treatment group, reported by 8.3% (4/48) subjects and 6.3% (3/48) subjects, respectively. In the Core Study, the most frequently reported treatment-related TEAE in the avatrombopag treatment group was nausea (12.5%), and was reported in a higher percentage of subjects compared to the placebo treatment group (no subjects). The next most frequent treatment-related TEAEs in the Core study reported in the avatrombopag treatment group were diarrhoea, fatigue, and pruritus (6.3% [3/48] subjects, each), none of which were reported in the placebo treatment group. In the combined Core Study and OLE Phase, the incidence rate for treatment-related TEAEs was 50.0% (32/34) subjects. The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs were nausea (17.2%), fatigue (9.4%), chills, headache, and pruritus (7.8%).</p><p>In the Core study, treatment-related AEs like nausea (12.5 avatrombopag versus 0% placebo), diarrhea, fatigue and pruritus (6.3% avatrombopag versus 0% placebo each) were reported more frequently in avatrombopag-treated subjects compared to placebo. Despite the fact that avatrombopag exposure was longer compared to the intended short-term use of 5 days, the applicant has discussed the reasons for the higher incidence of AEs in HCV patients who received avatrombopag in combination with antiviral agents compared to placebo. It is accepted that antiviral treatment itself is commonly associated with numerous adverse reactions including amongst others the more frequently reported AEs nausea, diarrhea, fatigue and pruritus. It is agreed with the Applicant that the observed higher incidence of these AEs in avatrombopag-treated patients after antiviral treatment compared to the incidence before antiviral treatment suggests that they were likely related to the antiviral therapy. However, it should be noted that thrombocytopenia has been reported as a commonly occurring adverse event after interferon treatment and thus should be considered when co-administrating avatrombopag with interferon products. Furthermore, chronic HCV patients with severe hepatic impairment may be at risk of hepatic decompensation when receiving avatrombopag in combination with antiviral therapy (e.g. interferon).</p><p>Due to the fact that only patients with a MELD score ranged from 8.2 to 9.7 have been included in this study, an increased risk of hepatic decompensation in these patients cannot be ruled out. However, the potential increased risk in those patients is mitigated by the short-term use of avatrombopag and the very limit current use of interferon with the advent of curative treatments for chronic hepatitis C. Additionally, the use of avatrombopag in patients receiving interferon products has been included as missing information in the RMP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Group 4</head><p>The applicant presents overall incidences of adverse events for the Group 4 safety analysis set consisting of data from two phase II and two phase III studies in patients suffering from ITP. In the pooled analysis, 97.7% of subjects in the avatrombopag group, 100% of subjects in the eltrombopag group and 63.6% of subjects in the placebo group had one or more adverse events. The most common TEAEs were the same for the avatrombopag and eltrombopag treatment groups with a lower incidence with placebo: headache (30.5%, 27.3%, and 13.6%, respectively) and fatigue (28.1%, 45.5%, and 9.1%, respectively). The majority of TEAEs in the avatrombopag and eltrombopag treatment groups and all TEAEs in the placebo treatment group were of mild severity. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs was higher in the avatrombopag treatment group compared to the eltrombopag treatment group (35.2% avatrombopag versus 27.3% eltrombopag).The subject incidence of adverse events considered by an investigator to be potentially treatment-related was 66.4% in the combined avatrombopag group, 72.7% in the eltrombopag group and 18.2% in the placebo group. The most frequently reported treatment-related AEs were headache (20.3% avatrombopag, 9.1% eltrombopag and 9.1% placebo, respectively), fatigue (12.5%, 18.2%, and 9.1%, respectively), dizziness (7.0%, 18.2%, and 4.5%, respectively) and diarrhea (5.5%, 18.2%, and 0%, respectively). The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related TEAEs was mainly reported in the avatrombopag treatment group (17.2%) compared to the eltrombopag (9.1%), and placebo (0%) treatment groups. No differential pattern of AEs between avatrombopag and eltrombopag could be identified. Although, the incidence of TEAEs in the long-term studies was higher in the avatrombopag treatment group compared to the placebo group, no safety concerns evoked from the studies in ITP patients for the intended short-term use of avatrombopag in patients with thrombocytopenia and CLD.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Group 6</head><p>The applicant presents overall incidences of adverse events for the Group 6 safety analysis set that consists of all phase I studies of the clinical development program. In single-dose studies, 406 (31.0%) of 1309 patients in the combined avatrombopag group and 24 (25.5%) of 94 patients in the combined placebo group had one or more adverse events. In multiple-dose studies, 20 (44.4%) of 45 subjects in the avatrombopag group and 9 (47.4%) of 19 subjects in the placebo group experienced one or adverse events. All reported TEAEs in the avatrombopag treatment group were of mild and moderate severity. In the single-dose studies, the most frequently reported treatment-related AEs in the avatrombopag or placebo treatment group was headache (3.8% in the avatrombopag group versus 9.6% in placebo). In the multiple-dose studies, the most frequently reported treatment-related AE in the avatrombopag treatment group was constipation (6.7% in the avatrombopag group versus none in placebo). No safety concerns evoked from the submitted single-or multiple-dose phase 1 studies</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse events of special interest</head><p>Group 1</p><p>In the primary safety analysis set, adverse events of special interest included bleeding events, thromboembolic events and recurrence of thrombocytopenia. The proposed AESIs are endorsed.</p><p>Hepatotoxicity has been reported as known side effect of marketed TPO receptor agonists. In the clinical development program of avatrombopag, abnormal liver function parameters (increased ALT, AST, AP, Bilirubin) have been reported in avatrombopag-treated patients and a possible hepatotoxic effect cannot be excluded (see also laboratory findings). The Applicant has clarified that the term "clinically significant liver tests" had been predefined as an adverse event of special interest in the Phase 3 avatrombopag clinical studies in patients with ITP (Study 302 and Study 305; ISS safety ISS Group 4). Data from those studies were available at the time the Study 310 and Study 311 protocols in patients with chronic liver disease were designed, and since no evidence of significant hepatotoxicity was identified with chronic avatrombopag dosing in the ITP studies, it was considered unnecessary to include it as an adverse event of special interest in studies of the acute 5-day treatment course in patients with chronic liver disease.</p><p>Although not predefined as AESI, liver function tests were monitored over the course of these studies. In those studies, patients of both treatment groups had abnormal liver function parameters. However, increased liver parameters were similar or lower in avatrombopag-treated patients compared to placebo.</p><p>Thus, since liver function abnormalities are more likely attributable to the underlying medical condition of patients suffering from chronic liver disease, no additional safety concerns regarding avatrombopag-induced hepatotoxicity arise.</p><p>In the pooled safety analysis set of Group 1, the incidence of bleeding events Grade 1 to 4 was equally distributed between the pooled avatrombopag group (10.6%) and placebo group (11.5%). The incidence of bleeding events of WHO Grade 2 to 4 was slightly lower in the combined avatrombopag compared to the placebo group (3.3% avatrombopag versus 3.8% placebo). An incidence of 2.6% of avatrombopag-treated subjects had a bleeding event of WHO Grade 2 to 4 from randomization to 7 days after the procedure, with 4 of these subjects also receiving a platelet transfusion. A higher percentage, 3.8%, of placebo-treated subjects had a WHO Grade 2 to 4 bleeding event from randomization to 7 days after the procedure, with 5 of these subjects also receiving a platelet transfusion. To assess the relationship of the bleeding events to the surgery, the underlying disease or the study drug, timing of onset of all reported bleedings was evaluated and summarized by the Applicant. The additional tables presented detailed timeline listings of each reported bleeding event (WHO Grade 2 to 4) to evaluate the relationship of the bleeding event to the surgery, the underlying disease or the study drug. Overall, in both baseline platelet count cohorts the incidence of bleeding events was similar or lower in avatrombopag-treated subjects compared to placebo and each event occurred in only one subject in each study. In both treatment groups of the Group 1 safety data set the majority of bleeding events occurred on the same day or after the day of the invasive procedure. The bleeding events reported prior the day of the invasive procedure occurred 1 to 4 days after the first avatrombopag dose and thus occurred before any platelet count increase effect of avatrombopag could occur. The provided timeline listings of each bleeding event clearly suggests that the reported bleeding events are most likely related to the underlying disease or the invasive procedure. No safety concerns arise from these data.</p><p>The incidence of the adverse event of recurrence of thrombocytopenia was low in Group 1 and was only reported in one placebo-treated subject (0.6%). Platelet counts returning to baseline levels after study drug discontinuation might increase the bleeding risk in patients with CLD. Recurrence of thrombocytopenia was defined as a platelet count of &lt;10×10 9 /L and 10×10 9 /L less than baseline count within 30 days of discontinuation. The Applicant has clarified that the definition of Recurrence of Thrombocytopenia chosen for inclusion in the phase 3 study protocols (study 310 and study 311)</p><p>coincidences with the definition applied to other approved TPO receptor agonists such as eltrombopag and romiplostin. The Applicants justification of the used definition of Recurrence of Thrombocytopenia is acceptable.</p><p>The AESI of thromboembolic events was reported in one subject in the 40 mg avatrombopag treatment group (0.4%) and two subjects (1.3%) in the placebo group. The thrombotic event of PVT in the 40 mg avatrombopag group occurred 13 days after the last dose and was judged as possibly related to the study drug. Additionally, one non treatment-emergent thrombotic AE of PVT was reported in the 60 mg avatrombopag treatment group 31 days after the last dose of avatrombopag. Except one subject in the placebo group all subjects experienced a thrombotic adverse event had platelet counts &lt;100 000/µl. The subject in the placebo group had a platelet count of 144 000/µl on study day 20. Since the thrombotic event of myocardial infarction occurred on study day 31, no firm conclusion regarding the relationship of platelet counts and thromboembolic events can be drawn. However, no apparent relationship between thrombotic events and increased platelet counts could be identified in avatrombopag-treated subjects.</p><p>Nevertheless, thromboembolic events are a known risk among patients with liver cirrhosis and the prevalence increases with the severity of the underlying disease. The risk of thromboembolic complications may further increase when patients undergo a surgery. However, little is known about the amount of platelet count increase that would increase risk of thromboembolic events in patients with chronic liver disease. It might be possible that any elevation of platelet counts increases the risk of thromboembolic events in patients who have a predisposition. The Applicant rated thromboembolic events as risk and a warning statement has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. This is endorsed.</p><p>Since the spleen plays an important role in platelet storage, thromboembolic events following splenectomy are not uncommon. Thus, the safety profile of avatrombopag might be different in these patients. Although splenectomy was not defined as exclusion criteria, no safety data of patients who underwent a splenectomy have been included in the submitted dossier. Thus, an increased risk of post-splenectomy thromboembolic events cannot be ruled out. As no splenectomised patients were enrolled in the pivotal studies "splenectomy" is included as missing information in the RMP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Group 2</head><p>In the safety analysis set of Group 2, bleeding events, thromboembolic events and Recurrence of thrombocytopenia were defined as adverse events of special interest. The AESI of bleeding events (WHO grade 2 to 4) was reported in 3.5% of subjects in the combined avatrombopag treatment group and 5.4% of subjects in the combined placebo treatment group. The incidence of bleeding-related events of WHO No subjects in the avatrombopag treatment group reported an AESI in the recurrence of thrombocytopenia category.</p><p>In the pooled analysis of Group 2, thromboembolic AESI were reported in 2 subjects each in both the combined avatrombopag treatment group (0.5%) and the combined placebo treatment group (1.0%). In addition to the thromboembolic events described in Group 1, one avatrombopag-treated subject of study 202 experienced a thromboembolic complication of PVT. The subject had a platelet count of 55 000/µl on the day of the thrombotic event. The thromboembolic event was judged as possibly related to the study drug by the investigator. Thrombotic events are a known risk among patients with liver cirrhosis and the prevalence increases with the severity of the underlying disease. Since this patient had a diagnosis of Child Pugh Class C liver disease, the risk of thromboembolic events might be increased due to the underlying primary disease. The risk is appropriately reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Group 3</head><p>No AESI of thromboembolic events, bleeding events, recurrence of thrombocytopenia or gastric atrophy have been reported in study 203.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Group 4</head><p>In the pooled safety analysis of Group 4, AESI included gastric atrophy, recurrence of thrombocytopenia, thromboembolic events, bleeding events, neoplastic events, and clinically significant liver test abnormalities. The majority of AESI occurred in the bleeding events category (14.1%). The recurrence of thrombocytopenia AESI was reported in 8.6% of avatrombopag treated subjects, thromboembolic event in 7.0%, neoplastic AESI in 4.7%, and clinically significant liver test AESI in 3.9%. The time of onset for the majority of treatment-emergent AESI in the avatrombopag treatment group (78%, 53/68) was after 6 weeks of dosing.</p><p>Thromboembolic event of PVT was reported in one subject 6 days after undergoing a splenectomy. On Study Day 244 (5 days after splenectomy), the subject's platelet count was greater than 400 000/µl and avatrombopag was discontinued. One day after discontinuation of study drug the patient experienced a thromboembolic complication of PVT and thrombophlebitis. Both events were considered as possibly related to the study drug. Since the spleen plays an important role in platelet storage, an increased risk of post-splenectomy thromboembolic events in patients treated with avatrombopag cannot be excluded. avatrombopag is intended to be administered for short-term use (5 days), a potential long term toxicity of avatrombopag can be envisaged. To meet this risk, off-label use/repeat use and Bone marrow fibrosis (long-term use) were included in the updated RMP as important potential risk by the Applicant.</p><p>Group 5</p><p>In the pooled safety analysis of Group 5, Bleeding Events were the most frequently reported treatment-emergent AESI in the total avatrombopag (5.8%) and placebo treatment groups (4.9%), with a generally similar incidence between both treatment groups. No treatment-emergent AESI were reported in the eltrombopag treatment group. A small and similar percentage of subjects in the total avatrombopag and placebo treatment group reported AESI in the Recurrence of Thrombocytopenia (1.9% avatrombopag versus 0.4% placebo), and Thromboembolic Events (1.9% versus 0.8%), with these events primarily occurring in the long-term open label studies.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Serious adverse events and deaths Deaths</head><p>Across the clinical development program, a total of four fatal adverse events were reported in patients with thrombocytopenia and CLD, with three deaths in the combined avatrombopag treatment group and one death in the placebo treatment group. Two of the three deaths in the avatrombopag treatment group occurred in study 310 of the primary safety analysis (Group 1) and one death in the phase II study 202 (Group 2). The adverse events with an outcome of death in the avatrombopag treatment group were multi-organ failure (26 days after the last dose), hepatic coma (30 days after the last dose) and a combination of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, cardiopulmonary arrest, metabolic acidosis, and acute renal failure (5 days after the last dose). In the placebo arm acute myocardial infarction, multi-organ failure and hepatocellular carcinoma were reported as cause of death. Except of cardiopulmonary arrest all other fatal events were judged as unlikely related to the investigational drug.</p><p>No deaths were reported in ITP patients or healthy subjects. The applicant provided case narratives for each of the subject's death.</p><p>It is important to note that all three deaths in the avatrombopag group occurred in patients who suffered from Child Pugh class C liver disease whereas no death in patients with severe hepatic impairment was reported in the placebo arm. Although it might be possible that the fatal outcomes of hepatic coma and multi-organ failure (acute liver failure, acute kidney injury and respiratory failure) are associated with the natural progression of the underlying disease, a more detailed justification and clarification of the background leading to these outcomes has been provided. The very detailed review of the cases with fatal outcome has substantiated that it was more likely associated with the natural progression of the underlying disease, and no further safety issue has emerged.</p><p>Since only a limited number of patients with severe hepatic impairment have been included and three of these patients have died during the clinical development program, the observation reflect that patients with severe hepatic impairment are known to have a higher risk of mortality and excluding these patients from the indication would unnecessarily limit access to those patients who need invasive procedures as part of their clinical management. However, the provided safety database including only 16 patients with</p><p>Child Pugh class C liver disease is limited. Therefore, the applicant has included a warning statement in In addition to treatment-emergent deaths, a total of four non treatment-emergent deaths were reported across the clinical development program. The patients died either before treatment (2 patients) or after the posttreatment follow-up period of the study (2 patients). The fatal adverse events following the 30-day observation period after the last dose of avatrombopag were splenic haemorrhage 47 days after the last dose and decompensation of pre-existing liver cirrhosis 101 days after the last dose of avatrombopag (study 203). This subject who also received antiviral therapy experienced a SAE of hepatic cirrhosis 47 days after the last dose of avatrombopag and died 101 days after the last dose of the study drug due to liver decompensation. Although the event of liver decompensation occurred 101 days after the last dose of study drug and avatrombopag is intended to be administered for short-term use, there might be an increased risk of hepatic decompensation in chronic HCV patients with cirrhosis when receiving interferon therapy. Since this patient who had a MELD score of 8 (Child Pugh class A liver disease) experienced a rapid progression of the underlying disease, the medical history and the fatal outcome of this patient was reviewed in details. No signals were identified which compromise the safety of avatrombopag in CLD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Serious adverse events</head><p>Group 1</p><p>In the primary safety analysis set (Group 1), 20 (7.3%) of 274 patients in the combined avatrombopag treatment group (40 or 60 mg) and 14 (9%) of 156 subjects treated with placebo experienced one or more nonfatal serious adverse events (SAE). Gastrointestinal haemorrhage and hyponatraemia were the only preferred terms reported for &gt;1 subject in the combined avatrombopag group (0.7% avatrombopag versus none in placebo each). The incidence of treatment-related SAE was low and similar between the avatrombopag and placebo treatment group (0.4% in avatrombopag versus 1.3% in placebo). All treatment-related SAEs were reported in a single patient each. The overall incidence of TESAE was similar between both treatment groups and is considered consistent with the underlying medical condition of the study population. However, numerical imbalances were identified between the two pivotal phase III studies. The incidence of SAEs was significantly higher in study 310 compared to study 311 (12.2% in the combined avatrombopag group of study 310 versus 1.6% in the combined avatrombopag group of study 311). Whereas in study 311 the incidence of SAE was very low and similar between both baseline platelet count cohorts and placebo, considerable differences were observed in study 310. In the low baseline platelet count cohort of study 310, the incidence of SAEs war significantly lower for patients treated with 60 mg avatrombopag compared to placebo (11.2% 60 mg avatrombopag versus 22.9% placebo).</p><p>However, significantly higher rates of SAEs have been reported in patients treated with 40 mg avatrombopag (high baseline platelet count cohort) compared to placebo (13.8% 40 mg avatrombopag versus 3.1% placebo). While none of these events in the 40 mg avatrombopag treatment group were judged as related to the study drug, the differences between the avatrombopag and placebo group is explained since none of the reported SAE in the 40 mg avatrombopag group occurred in more than one subject. The demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable between the baseline platelet count cohorts and thus would not explain the observed differences between the treatment groups. The difference in the incidence of SAEs between avatrombopag and placebo treatment groups was not observed in study 311 with comparable rates between treatments groups of both baseline platelet cohorts. Although the reflection does not satisfactorily explain the reported higher incidence of SAE in the 40 mg avatrombopag group compared to placebo, it cannot be further clarified.</p></div>

The most frequently reported TESAE was thrombocytopenia, reported by 1.7% of subjects in the total avatrombopag treatment group and no subjects in the total placebo treatment group.</p><p>Of note, thrombocytopenia was only reported by subjects receiving avatrombopag in the long-term studies. In general, in long-term studies the incidence of SAE was higher in avatrombopag-treated compared to the placebo group. Treatment-related TESAEs was higher in the total avatrombopag treatment group (3.1%) when compared to the total placebo treatment group (1.2%).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Laboratory findings</head><p>The applicant presents multiple tables and figures, and this is acknowledged, and has additionally provided individual tables which summarise patient exposure, special populations, MedDRA terms related to age, and laboratory findings for ISS Groups 1, 2, and 5, side by side, and no safety signals emerged.</p><p>However, in Group 1 platelet count on Procedure Day (Day 10) for the 60-mg avatrombopag-treated subjects was 65.3×109/L in the Low Baseline Platelet Count Cohort and 86.7×109/L in the High Baseline Platelet Count Cohort which roughly corresponds to a doubling of the baseline count. About 1% of patients treated with avatrombopag showed platelet counts exceeding 200×10 9 /L which might be a meaningful threshold for thromboembolic events in the indicated population. The incidence of high platelet counts in Assessment report EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 Page 109/123 patients implies that the risk for exaggerated rise of thrombocytes in patients treated with avatrombopag over a period of 5 days is low. The risk individually in high increments in platelet counts and a potential thrombotic risk is adequately reflected in the SmPC.</p><p>Haematology parameters seemed to show some minor changes in in subjects treated with Doptelet. A decrease of blood cells and hemoglobin in some patients treated with avatrombopag has been observed and was further elaborated.</p><p>Clinical chemistry parameters (e.g. ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, GGT, albumin) were presented at baseline, day 4, procedure day, day 7 after procedure and follow up. However only a small number of patients was investigated on day 4 and 7 after treatment. ALT, AST, AP and Bilirubin showed an increase after treatment with Doptelet in the avatrombopag group but returned to baseline at the time of follow up. No specific safety concern related to hepatotoxic effect arise from the data presented, because elevations in liver function tests were similar in the avatrombopag treatment group in comparison to the placebo group on the days of monitoring including the day of follow up.</p><p>Urinalysis did not show significant differences between treatment and placebo groups.</p><p>Vital signs did not show meaningful changes after the treatment with avatrombopag. ECG results were unaltered and no meaningful prolongation of QTc was observed in most of the patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety in special populations</head><p>Safety in special populations has been evaluated for the subgroups of age, sex, race, geographic region, baseline platelet count, bleeding risk, HCC status, MELD and Child Pugh score and disease etiology for the Groups 1 and 2.</p><p>The frequency of AEs in subjects &lt;65 is similar in the treatment and placebo group in Group 1 and 2. A comprehensive subgroup analysis by age has been presented. Only twelve patients over 75 were exposed to avatrombopag. Out of these one patient was over 85. Abdominal pain was reported more frequently in the age group of 65-74, however the incidence was similar in the treatment and the placebo group.</p><p>Pyrexia was reported more frequently in the age group of 75+ but the incidence was higher in the placebo group than in the avatrombopag group.</p><p>The incidence of adverse events was higher in females in the treatment and in the placebo group. Due to this fact this finding does not seem to be treatment-related.</p><p>The incidence of AEs was higher in Asian subjects than in White subjects in the avatrombopag and in the placebo group (Group1). Therefore this finding is not suspected to be treatment-related. The number of black people and "other" was very low and no final conclusion can be drawn whether there are differences in the safety profile of avatrombopag in these subgroups.</p><p>The subgroup analysis does not show TEAE-relation depending on the geographic region.</p><p>The incidence of TEAEs was slightly higher in the low baseline platelet count group (60 mg avatrombopag/placebo) than in the high baseline platelet count group (40 mg avatrombopag/placebo) (Group1). However the incidence of AEs in the placebo groups was very similar to the treatment groups, relationship to the treatment seems unlikely. The subgroup suffering from liver cancer showed more TEAEs in the treatment group which is especially significant in the low baseline platelet count group (60 mg avatrombopag 74.4 % versus 52.0 % in the placebo group -Group1). Increased ALT has been shown in 13.3 % in the treatment group and in 3.9% in the placebo group and is not listed in the HCC-neg. Pyrexia showed the most significant difference (23 % treatment group, 11.9 % in the placebo group). The incidence of abdominal pain and oedema peripheral also showed a slight difference. However the number of patients was limited and most of the AEs have been reported in only a few patients in each treatment group. No specific pattern of AEs could be recognized. No drug induced hepatotoxicity could be identified in the HCC subgroup.</p><p>Across the Child Pugh B subgroup (Group 1) the incidence of AEs was slightly higher in both treatment groups (high and low baseline platelet count) than in the placebo groups. The incidence of TEAEs in Child Pugh Class C patients especially in the high baseline platelet count group was much higher than in the placebo group (66.7 % versus 40 % in Group 1 and 80.6 % versus 54.5 % in Group 2). However the number of patients treated with avatrombopag was low and a final conclusion cannot be drawn for the safety of Doptelet in Child-Pugh C patients. However, no signals of hepatotoxicity has emerged by treatment with avatrombopag across classes. The subgroup analysis by disease etiology showed only a slight trend for more frequent AEs in the treatment groups in alcoholic liver disease and chronic viral hepatitis.</p><p>Data have been presented in individual tables that provide an overview of all adverse events as a function of intrinsic factors across the ISS safety analysis ISS Groups 1, 2, and 5. The safety data in these tables did not identify any new or untoward safety concerns as a function of intrinsic factors. The side effect profile for avatrombopag was generally comparable to placebo without clinically meaningful differences.</p><p>Data have also been presented to provide safety analyses of extrinsic factors as per ICH guideline E5(R1), and provide a single table that summarizes the results for groups 1, 2 and 5. The analysis support the safety in avatrombopag treatment in the trial design, without clinically meaningful differences between placebo and TPO analogue avatrombopag. The difference in placebo and treatment group 5 are expected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunological events</head><p>No information has been given on the immunogenicity of Doptelet. Due to the fact that Doptelet represents a small molecule, no immunological reaction is to be expected.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discontinuation due to AES</head><p>Across Group 1 and 2 only three avatrombopag-treated patients (0.8%) discontinued the study drug prematurely due to adverse events. The causes for discontinuation were myalgia and anaemia in one subject, pyrexia in one subject and vomiting and nausea in another subject. In Group 3, only one patient treated with placebo discontinued study drug due to the adverse event of rash. The frequency and type of findings in Groups 1-3 does not seem to give rise to concern.</p><p>In Group 4, 13.3% of subjects treated with avatrombopag and 9.1% of subjects treated with eltrombopag discontinued study drug due to TEAEs. In the avatrombopag group, the only TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug reported in more than 1 subject were platelet count increased and headache (3.9% and 1.6% of subjects). Treatment-related TESAEs leading to study drug discontinuation were only reported in avatrombopag-treated subjects (3.9%) and included leukocytosis, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, dizziness, headache, and transient ischemic attack. Although, the incidence of TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation was higher in the avatrombopag treatment group compared to the placebo group, no safety concerns evoked for the intended short-term use of avatrombopag in patients with thrombocytopenia and CLD.</p><p>In Group 5, the incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug was higher in the total avatrombopag treatment group <ref type="formula">(</ref> Platelet count increased was the most frequently reported TEAE leading to discontinuation of study drug in the total avatrombopag treatment group.</p><p>In Group 6, a total of 0.5% of subjects in the avatrombopag treatment group and 0.0% of subjects in the placebo treatment group experienced TEAEs leading to discontinuation from the single-dose studies.</p><p>Thrombocytosis was the cause for discontinuation in 0.2% of subjects. One subject discontinued due to vomiting, influenza-like illness, ALT increased, myalgia, and headache. A thorough review of this case in a phase 1 study, showed a mild course and full recovery, and no further safety concerns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.2.">Discussion on clinical safety</head><p>A total of 1365 subjects have been randomized across 24 studies in the avatrombopag development program. The total safety database comprises 1107 persons, who had received at least 1 dose of avatrombopag and had at least 1 post-dose safety assessment, including 520 healthy volunteers (one or multiple doses), 395 patients with CLD and thrombocytopenia undergoing a scheduled diagnostic or surgical procedure, 64 subjects with hepatitis C-related thrombocytopenia and 128 patients with chronic ITP. A total of 435 patients were enrolled in the two identical, pivotal, phase 3 studies (310 and 311) and</p><p>169 patients in the two supportive, phase 2 studies <ref type="bibr">(202 and 204)</ref>. No patient appears to have been included twice. Study 204 (n=39) was a study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of once-daily oral avatrombopag in a Japanese target population. The safety data base is adequate, and the number of persons exposed to avatrombopag is deemed adequate for the safety evaluation.</p><p>The pooled safety data in pivotal study 310 and 311 (Group 1) included a total of 430 randomized subjects, with 274 subjects in the combined avatrombopag treatment group, and 156 subjects in the combined placebo treatment group across the 2 baseline platelet count cohorts.</p><p>Treatment in the five day dosing with avatrombopag was not observed in the data reviewed here presented by the Applicant to be associated with any clinically significant changes in the incidence or type of AEs, TESAEs, Grade 3 of 4 AEs, AESI or clinically meaningful changes in laboratory haematology, chemistry, liver function or ECG values. Patients previously treated with avatrombopag have been excluded from studies 310 and 311. However retreatment of subjects with avatrombopag is likely to occur, since patients (e.g. suffering from hepatic cancer) might undergo invasive procedures (e.g. radiofrequency ablation) for several times. There is only little or no experience in previously treated subjects. The risks of retreatment with avatrombopag are reflected in the SmPC. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) are considered to be consistent with the underlying primary disease of the study population and the nature of the invasive procedures. In the pooled analysis of the primary safety data set (Group 1), the most common TEAEs in at least 5% of subjects were pyrexia (9.9% in the avatrombopag group versus 9.0% in the placebo group), abdominal pain (6.6% versus 6.4%), nausea (6.6% versus 7.1%) and headache (5.5% versus 6.4%). No adverse events occurring in ≥ 3% of subjects had a ≥ 2% higher incidence in the avatrombopag group than in the placebo group. No substantial differences were noted between the treatment groups. However, the incidence of Grade 3-5</p><p>TEAEs in study 310 was inconsistent between the treatment groups in the two baseline platelet count cohorts. While the incidence of Grade 3-5 TEAEs was lower in the avatrombopag 60 mg group compared to placebo (7.9% avatrombopag versus 16.7% placebo), a higher incidence has been observed in the avatrombopag 40 mg group compared to the placebo group (17.2% avatrombopag versus 0% placebo).</p><p>A thorough review of TEAEs according to intrinsic and extrinsic factors and based on case narratives did not demonstrate a safety concern. However, special warnings are reflected in the SmPC regarding patients with the most severe CLD, the individual increase in platelet count at procedure day and the circumstance with missing information.</p><p>In the primary safety analysis adverse events of special interest included bleeding events, thromboembolic events and recurrence of thrombocytopenia. The incidence of bleeding events of WHO Grade 2 to 4 was slightly lower in the combined avatrombopag compared to the placebo group (3.3% avatrombopag versus 3.8% placebo). To assess the relationship of the bleeding events to the surgery, the underlying disease or the study drug, timing of onset of all reported bleeding-related events was evaluated and summarized by the applicant. No avatrombopag-treated subject experienced an AESI of Recurrence of Thrombocytopenia. The incidence of thromboembolic events was lower in the avatrombopag group (0.4%) compared to the placebo group (1.3%). Thromboembolic events were not associated with increased platelet counts. However, it might be possible that any elevation of platelet counts increases the risk of thromboembolic events in patients who have a predisposition (liver cirrhosis, surgery). The risk of thromboembolic events is adequately reflected in section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC.</p><p>Since the spleen plays an important role in platelet storage, thromboembolic events following splenectomy are not uncommon. The safety profile of avatrombopag might be different in these patients.</p><p>Although splenectomy was not defined as exclusion criteria, no safety data of patients who underwent a splenectomy have been included in the submitted dossier. Splenectomy was included as missing information in the RMP.</p><p>The two pivotal studies were blinded. Still, it may be considered if reporting of AEs may be biased, if the effect of the placebo versus active treatment may be evident from the platelet count at procedure day.</p><p>Still, the platelet count must be known prior to a scheduled procedure in patients with a coagulopathy following a therapeutic intervention, and platelet counts fluctuate frequently, as evidenced by higher values in the placebo cohort. Therefore the study design and conductance is accepted.</p><p>Across the clinical development program, a total of four fatal adverse events were reported in patients with thrombocytopenia and CLD, with three deaths in the combined avatrombopag treatment group and one death in the placebo treatment group. The adverse events with an outcome of death in the avatrombopag treatment group were multi-organ failure (26 days after the last dose), hepatic coma (30 days after the last dose) and a combination of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, cardiopulmonary arrest, metabolic acidosis, and acute renal failure (5 days after the last dose). Except for cardiopulmonary arrest all other fatal events were judged as unlikely related to the investigational drug. It is important to note that all three deaths in the avatrombopag group occurred in patients who suffered from Child Pugh class C liver disease whereas no death in patients with severe hepatic impairment was reported in the placebo arm. The very detailed review of the cases with fatal outcome has substantiated that it was more likely associated with the natural progression of the underlying disease, and no further safety issue has emerged. A warning was included in the SmPC to emphasize the need for close monitoring of patients with advanced Child-Pugh (class C) disease. The rate of study drug discontinuations due to AEs was very low and did not raise any safety concerns for the intended short-term use of avatrombopag.</p><p>Laboratory findings were presented and include parameters of hematology, chemistry and urinalysis. A serious risk in the treatment with avatrombopag could be an excessive increase of platelets which might represent an increased risk for thromboembolic events. About 1% of patients treated with avatrombopag showed platelet counts exceeding 200×10 9 /L which might be a meaningful threshold for thromboembolic events in the indicated population. The incidence of high platelet counts in patients implies that the risk for exaggerated rise of thrombocytes in patients treated with avatrombopag over a period of 5 days is low. The risk is adequately reflected in the SmPC. The safety of avatrombopag in Group 1 is further supported by safety data from the Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies with avatrombopag, which included various doses, formulations, and single and multiple dose regimens in both healthy volunteers and subjects with various clinical conditions. The adverse events appear to be only temporary, except the few irreversible outcomes, and are manageable.</p><p>The treatment-emergent SAE by ≥2 subjects in the active treatment group in Group 5 related to thrombocytopenia (1.7% n=10/587), and anaemia, vomiting, abdominal pain, acute kidney injury, platelet count decreased, pneumonia and urinary tract infection (all less than 0.7%). Still, in the management of this patient-population these SAEs may be expected, without a predisposition to a specific cause and are potentially reversible within hours to days. The Applicant has adequately assessed events of special interest, deaths, vascular manifestations (embolism or bleeding). However, numerical imbalances were identified between the two pivotal phase III studies. The incidence of SAEs was significantly higher in study 310 compared to study 311 (12.2% avatrombopag group of study 310 versus 1.6% avatrombopag group of study 311). Additionally, a higher incidence of SAEs has been observed in the high-platelet baseline group compared to placebo while the incidence of SAEs was lower in the low-platelet baseline arm compared to placebo. However, none of the reported SAE in the 40 mg avatrombopag group occurred in more than one subject, and it was clarified that the demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable between the baseline platelet count cohorts and thus would not explain the observed differences between the treatment groups. The difference in the incidence of SAEs between avatrombopag and placebo treatment groups was not observed in study 311 with comparable rates between treatments groups of both baseline platelet cohorts, and the issue is considered to be caused by variations in studies, and the united results to reflect avatrombopag treatment.</p><p>The data demonstrate that the safety of avatrombopag is comparable to placebo in these studies with a very low risk for fatal outcome, no (significant) increase in the incidence of hepatotoxicity, thromboembolic or bleeding events, infections or other unacceptable manifestations in avatrombopag-treated subjects. During follow-up upon discontinuation of TPO-receptor agonist and the stimulation of megakaryocytes and thrombocyte production, rebound thrombocytopenia did not manifest as a problem.</p><p>However, the provided safety database is limited for Child Pugh Class C patients and no firm conclusion regarding the safety profile of avatrombopag can be drawn. The applicant is asked to provide a feasibility study on the performance of a post authorization safety study (PASS). Furthermore, the applicant has included a warning statement in the SmPC indicating that patients with Child Pugh class C liver disease should be closely monitored during avatrombopag treatment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disease or condition</head><p>The applicant is claiming this indication: "Doptelet is indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo a procedure."</p><p>Chronic liver disease (CLD), independent of aetiology, is commonly associated with thrombocytopenia due to a number of different causes. Contributing factors are, among others, decreased hepatic production of the haematopoietic growth factor thrombopoetin, sequestration of platelets in the spleen and suppression of the bone marrow.</p><p>Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count below 150 x10 9 /L. It can be further specified as moderate (50-100 x10 9 /L) and severe (&lt;50 x10 9 /L). Low platelet counts in CLD increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery and invasive procedures. Clinical practice guidelines vary with their recommendation of desirable platelet levels before attempting an elective procedure. However, it is generally agreed that many invasive procedures like liver biopsies can be done safely with platelet counts above 50-75 x10 9 /L.</p><p>Avatrombopag is an orally active, small-molecule thrombopoetin (TPO) receptor agonist. TPO receptor agonists upregulate platelet production by stimulating differentiation of haematopoietic stem cells and megakaryocyte progenitor cells to megakaryocytes and their proliferation, thus upregulating platelet production. As platelet response with TPO receptor agonists takes several days, agents of this class are suitable for prophylaxis of bleeding and not suitable when haemostasis is needed on an emergency basis.</p><p>The objective of avatrombopag therapy is to elevate platelet levels into an acceptable range in order to minimize bleeding risk during elective invasive procedures in patients with CLD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Available therapies and unmet medical need</head><p>The standard of care for patients with chronic liver disease and severe thrombocytopenia before a scheduled invasive procedure with a risk of bleeding is to diagnose and treat other factors which contribute to increase the bleeding risk <ref type="formula">(</ref> Lusutrombopag, a TPO-receptor agonists was recently authorised in Europe for the use in patients with thrombocytopenia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main clinical studies</head><p>The dossier includes two pivotal, phase 3 clinical trials for avatrombopag, study 310 and 311. In addition, two phase 2 studies, 202 and 204 are supportive for the application. Both pivotal trials have a randomized, global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily oral avatrombopag for the treatment of adults with thrombocytopenia associated with chronic liver disease prior to an elective procedure. The supportive studies have a similar design and included dose finding and a study in Japanese patients (n =39).</p><p>The studies 310 and 311 included a total of 231 and 204 CLD patients, respectively, mostly Caucasian (60%), and patients of Asian ethnicity (33%). All patients had severe thrombocytopenia. The patients were randomized 2:1 to active treatment with avatrombopag or placebo, respectively. The dosage of avatrombopag was individually decided according to the baseline platelet count in the screening period, in this way: once daily, 40 mg if count was ≥40 and &lt;50 x10 9 /L, and 60 mg if count &lt;40 x10 9 /L. The scheduled procedure was performed 5-8 days after the last dose of study drug (on day 10 -13).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Favourable effects</head><p>The primary efficacy endpoint in both pivotal Phase 3 studies was the proportion of subjects who did not require a platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure for bleeding after randomization and up to 7 days following a scheduled procedure. Responders were defined as subjects who did not require a platelet transfusion or rescue procedure for bleeding. The primary endpoint was reached by 66.9% (95% CI 59.6 -74.2) in the 60 mg cohort (low baseline platelet count), and by 88.0% (95% CI 82.2 -93.9) in the 40 mg cohort (high baseline platelet count). In the corresponding placebo control groups, a response for the primary endpoint was achieved by 28.6% (CI 95% 19.3 -37.9) in the low baseline platelet cohort and in 35.8% (95% CI 24.3 -47.3) in the high baseline cohor. The results were consistent between the two pivotal studies. The results in pooled analysis demonstrated a treatment difference in the proportion of subjects not requiring a platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure for bleeding of 36.3% in the low baseline platelet group and of 52.2% in the high baseline platelet group.</p><p>The first secondary endpoint, defined as the proportion of patients achieving a platelet count ≥50 x 10(9)/L on procedure day was achieved in (pooled data) 68.1% (95 CI 60.9 -75.3) in the low platelet baseline group, and in 90.6% (95% CI 85.3 -95.9). In the corresponding placebo group 5.5% (95% CI 0.8 -10.2) in the low baseline platelet group and 29.9% (95% CI 18.9 -40.8) in the high baseline platelet group, respectively. Again, acceptable consistency was observed across the two studies, and the primary endpoint, and the first secondary endpoint each demonstrate the effect of the treatment.</p><p>The effect was observed across all CLD patients according to MELD score, whereas patients with Child-Pugh class C and a platelet count &lt; 40 G/L at baseline did not have effect of treatment by primary or first secondary endpoint. Forest plot analysis showed a beneficial effect across demographic factors, platelet count and risk of bleeding according to procedure.</p><p>However, the wording of the indication must reflect the studied population with platelet counts below 50 G/L, thus: "Doptelet is indicated for the treatment of severe thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo an invasive procedure."</p><p>Avatrombopag is an oral TPO-receptor agonist which may be taken by the patient at home, once daily in five days. The planned increase in the platelet count to desired levels to coincide (day 10-13) with a scheduled procedure has been demonstrated, and overshoot in thrombocyte counts are rare. Monitoring the increment in platelets in blood samples on day 3-4 may prevent a full five day pulse of avatrombopag in patients with excessive response. In this way an increase in risk for ischaemic events may be reduced, but the planned procedure on day 10-13 still performed due to the half-life of platelets produced by the bone marrow in the patient. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects</head><p>Differences between East Asian populations and Caucasian appear to exist in terms of exposure which is attributed to the higher bodyweight in the Caucasian subpopulation. Furthermore, a less sensitive PD response in the East Asian population was apparent in the pop PK/PD analysis. The integrated efficacy analysis of the pivotal trials, including a mixed population showed comparable efficacy between races.</p><p>Still, it is not quite clear why the differences in exposures of avatrombopag between Caucasian and Chinese subjects are observed. It seems as if there is no relevant impact on PD or efficacy emerging from the differences in PK exposure. Furthermore, there are no racial differences in the activities of the main metabolic pathway enzymes of avatrombopag.</p><p>While there are comprehensive data illustrating the efficacy of a single cycle of treatment with avatrombopag, there are no data supporting the efficacy of Doptelet after repeated administration.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Unfavourable effects</head><p>The total safety database comprises 1107 persons, who had received at least 1 dose of avatrombopag and had at least 1 post-dose safety assessment, including 520 healthy volunteers (one or multiple doses), 395 patients with CLD and thrombocytopenia undergoing a scheduled diagnostic or surgical procedure, 64</p><p>subjects with hepatitis C-related thrombocytopenia and 128 patients with chronic ITP. A total of 435 patients were enrolled in the two identical, pivotal, phase 3 studies (310 and 311) and 169 patients in the two supportive, phase 2 studies (202 and 204).</p><p>TEAEs (any) reported in the pivotal trials in patients suffering from CLD accompanied by severe thrombocytopenia were reported in 54.0% in the combined treatment group and in 55.1% in the placebo group. Grade 3/4 TEAEs were observed in 10.9% and 10.3%, respectively. Consistent results were seen in the supportive studies. The most frequent adverse events were pyrexia (9.9%) and abdominal pain (6.6%). No substantial difference is noted between the avatrombopag and placebo groups, and TEAEs were not related to recommended dose. The Applicant has adequately described adverse events of special interest, including thrombosis and bleeding. The thromboembolic events affected 1 patient (0.4%) related to avatrombopag treatment, a portal vein thrombosis, whereas one patient had a myocardial infarction, one patient a pulmonary embolism with DIC in the placebo group in the pivotal trials. Bleeding events (reported as WHO grade 2-4) was registered in 3.3% (n=9) by active treatment, compared to 3.8% (n=6) by placebo in the combined data study 310+311. The bleeding symptoms in these 15 patients were distributed across 12 causes by preferred term.</p><p>Across the clinical development program, a total of four fatal adverse events were reported in patients with thrombocytopenia associated with CLD, with three deaths in the combined avatrombopag treatment group and one death in the placebo treatment group. The adverse events with an outcome of death in the avatrombopag treatment group were multi-organ failure, hepatic coma and a combination of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, cardiopulmonary arrest, metabolic acidosis, and acute renal failure.</p><p>Except for cardiopulmonary arrest all other fatal events were judged as unlikely related to avatrombopag.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects</head><p>A limited number of patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh class C) have been included in the clinical development program of avatrombopag. The administration of avatrombopag in this vulnerable subgroup at higher risk for thromboembolic events has been justified, however uncertainties remain on the safety aspects in this subgroup, which will be further monitored through additional PhV activities (see RMP). Relevant warnings have also been included in the SmPC.</p><p>Chronic HCV patients with severe hepatic impairment may be at risk of hepatic decompensation when receiving avatrombopag in combination with interferon. No patients were enrolled in the phase 3 studies while treated with interferons. Considering the progress in antiviral treatment by non-interferon based agent, the uncertainty of a five-day pulse treatment with avatrombopag is not an issue, but is reflected as missing information in the RMP. A warning has also been included in the SmPC. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.1.">Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects</head><p>The efficacy of avatrombopag given as a five-day, oral treatment according to platelet count in the individual patient was demonstrated. Most procedures could be performed as the target platelet count at procedure day was achieved and also without a significant proportion of patients experiencing an overshoot and increased risk of thrombosis. The decrease on platelet count after cessation of stimulation of the megakaryocytes and platelet production is steady over 2-3 weeks, without a risk of a rebound phenomenon, and then increased risk of bleeding. The results are supported by the second secondary endpoint of a significantly higher increment in platelet count by treatment. The favourable effect is clinically meaningful. Being a small-molecule avatrombopag may be used repeatedly in the same individuals, as the platelet count is not expected to improve in this patient population.</p><p>The treatment with avatrombopag may be taken at home, once daily for only five days. Planned procedures may be performed with a high probability, because the platelet count peaked ten days later (10-13 days) in most patients. It may be considered that an insufficient response in the increase of absolute platelet count does not necessarily mean that an elective procedure is cancelled, because a platelet transfusion can still be used to attempt achieving platelet counts that permit the scheduled surgery. It is recommended for all procedures that the treating specialist individually assesses the increment in platelet count on the day of the procedure and decides whether a follow-up within days is necessary (and the procedure is postponed), or initiate other necessary intervention in patients with a high increase (even within normal range, from baseline) due to the risk of thrombosis (see SmPC 4.2). A specific monitoring for TEAEs is recommended in all patients with Child-Pugh class C treated with avatrombopag.</p><p>The observed unfavourable effects were generally consistent with the multi-morbidity of the investigated population and the nature of the invasive procedure and no substantial imbalance with regard to the nature and severity of adverse events observed in the placebo group was apparent. Non-fatal TEAEs and SAEs may be considered to be in general temporary, reversible and manageable within hours to days of supportive treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.2.">Balance of benefits and risks</head><p>The five-day oral treatment with avatrombopag has favourable effects with benefits for the possibility to conduct scheduled procedures that outweigh the risks of avatrombopag in the target population / patients with severe thrombocytopenia associated with chronic liver disease. Avatrombopag is considered to be Assessment report EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 Page 122/123 safe and well tolerated and uncertainties concerning critical clinical circumstances (e.g. treatment of Child</p><p>Pugh Class C patients) are sufficiently reflected in the SmPC and RMP.

A refined Fpen was calculated based on the estimated prevalence of all patients with thrombocytopenia and liver disease in Europe which is 36.1 per 10,000 population equating to a prevalence (P) value of 0.00361. The number of avatrombopag treatment periods per patient could be estimated from 1 to 3 treatments per year.

Concerning effects of CYP2C9 inhibition or induction, upper and lower margins of predicted platelet counts fall outside the presumed limits of safety and efficacy, respectively. This, however, does not result in clinically relevant changes in PD.Overall, the clinical pharmacodynamics of avatrombopag are considered sufficiently described. The proposed clinical dosing regimen of 40 mg or 60 mg QD avatrombopag for 5 days, dependent of baseline platelet counts, is supported.The overall avatrombopag clinical development program enrolled more than 1350 subjects, including 532 healthy subjects and 824 patients in 24 sponsor-initiated clinical studies. Four clinical studies (n = 604) were specifically conducted in patients with Chronic Liver Disease (CLD) and thrombocytopenia who are scheduled to undergo an invasive procedure (the proposed indication). The four studies were all randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled trials.The efficacy data for avatrombopag in the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with Chronic Liver Disease (CLD) who are scheduled to undergo a procedure consists of 4 clinical studies (n=604). The studies include two global, pivotal phase 3 studies (Study 310 and Study 311, n=435 FAS) and 2 multicentre, supportive phase 2 studies(Study 202 and Study 204, n= 169).

Therefore, further screening in a step-wise procedure for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT) is required. In accordance with the Guideline on the assessment of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) or very persistent (vP) andWhen the criteria for persistence and/or bioaccumulation are not met, there is no requirement to carry out evaluation of the T criterion within the PBT assessment."Available mammalian toxicity data for avatrombopag show no evidence of any endocrine disruption or mutagenicity, and no evidence of other toxicities indicative of environmental risk, based on secondary pharmacodynamics (lack of significant binding to 86 receptors, transporters or ion channels) and repeat dose toxicity, reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity data.The applicant therefore proposes to provide, as a post-marketing commitment, an updated ERA after the OECD 305 and 308 studies have been performed with an assessment of:Whether avatrombopag does or does not fulfil the P or vP criteria, as detailed in Guideline EMA/CVMP/ERA/52740/2012.Whether avatrombopag does or does not fulfil the B or vB criteria, as detailed in Guideline EMA/CVMP/ERA/52740/2012. Whether or not there is considered to be a need to carry out evaluation of the T criterion within the PBT assessment, as detailed in Guideline EMA/CVMP/ERA/52740/2012. The calculated refined PEC surfacewater was below the trigger value and therefore Phase II evaluation was not performed.</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="2">very bioaccumulative (vB) substances in veterinary medicinal products (EMA/CVMP/ERA/52740/2012),</cell></row><row><cell>the Applicant will perform a step-wise PBT assessment post-marketing:</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Persistence (P): Persistence will be assessed in a GLP-compliant OECD 308 study of aerobic</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>transformation in freshwater aquatic sediment systems.</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Bioaccumulation (B): Bioaccumulation will be assessed in a GLP-compliant OECD 305 fish</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>bioaccumulation study.</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Assessment report</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>EMA/CHMP/322871/2019</cell><cell>Page 38/123</cell></row></table><note>Toxicity (T): As stated in Section 1.2.3 of Guideline EMA/CVMP/ERA/52740/2012: "For animal welfare reasons it is recommended that the evaluation of persistence and bioaccumulation is carried out first.</note></figure>

A population PK analysis of data pooled from all the Phase 1 studies, and Study 202, Study 204, Study 310, and Study 311 provided information on the effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on PK. Studies were performed to examine the intrinsic effects of race on the PK and PD of avatrombopag in healthy Japanese, Chinese, and white subjects. The effect of food on the PK, exposure, and bioavailability (BA) of avatrombopag were also studied. Analyses of interactions between avatrombopag and P-gp inhibitors or CYP, namely CYP2C9 and CYP3A modulators were also performed.A comprehensive PK/PD analysis of data pooled fromStudy 202, Study 204, Study 310 and Study 311    examined the relationship between avatrombopag concentration and platelet counts, and avatrombopag concentration and QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF).</figDesc><table><row><cell>• Pivotal and Supportive Efficacy Studies: Tabular overview of clinical studies</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Clinical Pharmacology:</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>2.4.2.

With increased dosing (based on data from only 1 additional dose of 100 mg) a plateau appeared to be reached.The proposed posology of 40-60 mg once daily falls within the range where dose proportionality was demonstrated. Tmax was approximately 4-6.5 hours with no apparent dose dependency. Terminal T½ appeared equally dose independent and was approximately 18-24 hours. Bioavailability was an estimated minimum of 44%. Relative bioequivalence of the various avatrombopag formulations used in the clinical pharmacology development program was overall established. As studies demonstrated reduced variability, the 2G formulation (rather than the 3G formulation) was carried forward in clinical development. It was demonstrated that while absorption was relatively unaffected by fasted or fed state, the variability of PK parameters was markedly reduced when avatrombopag was administered under fed conditions. It was further demonstrated that the type of food (high-fat or low-fat) did not affect neither rate nor extent of absorption. Both types of food reduced the PK variability. Based on these observations the SmPC recommends that avatrombopag should be administered with food.Avatrombopag displayed high plasma protein binding (96.3%-96.6%) in vitro. In vivo data from the 14 C-ADME study demonstrated that avatrombopag concentration in red blood cells was approximately half of that in plasma. The V/F determined from the popPK analyses was 180L. This is indicative of broad intracellular distribution.EliminationThe 14 C-ADME study demonstrated that the primary route of excretion of avatrombopag is via feces (approx. 88% of the administered dose) while only 6% was excreted via urine. The major metabolite is 4-OH-avatrombopag (accounting for approx. 43.8% of the administered dose). CYP2C9 (76.2% relative contribution) was the major responsible CYP isoform for the formation of 4-hydroxyl cis metabolite of avatrombopag while CYP3A4 (82.9% relative contribution) was the major responsible isoform for the formation of 4-hydroxyl trans metabolite. Two 2 other metabolites were also identified in feces. No active metabolites were detected.The primary routes of metabolism of avatrombopag are via CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. CYP2C9 (76.2% relative contribution) forms the 4-hydroxyl cis metabolite of avatrombopag, while CYP3A4 (82.9% relative contribution) forms the 4-hydroxyl trans metabolite of avatrombopag. In total, 4-OH-avatrombopag in feces accounted for approx. 43.8% of the administered dose. An approx. 33.5% of the administered dose was recovered in feces as avatrombopag glucuronide. Further, in urine 3 [ 14 C]avatrombopag related peaks were found but unidentified. In urine, approx. 6% of administered avatrombopag was recovered.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Metabolism</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Influence of food: Distribution</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Assessment report Assessment report</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 EMA/CHMP/322871/2019</cell><cell>Page 41/123 Page 42/123</cell></row></table><note>ADME AbsorptionBioequivalence:</note></figure>

It included the effects of East Asian race (Japanese, Chinese, and Korean), plasma TPO, and albumin on the exposure-response slope parameter. PK/PD analysis detected a median 32% lower slope in East Asian subjects relative to the rest of the population, but overall change from Baseline in platelet counts during the window of scheduled procedure was not affected. The difference was not deemed clinically important.The effect of TPO on platelet count was assessed by simulating the final PK/PD model with increasing TPO levels ranging from 75, 100, and 125 ng/L, which are the most frequent TPO levels at Baseline in the</figDesc><table><row><cell>Primary and Secondary pharmacology</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Primary pharmacology</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>The final PK/</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Assessment report</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>EMA/CHMP/322871/2019</cell><cell>Page 46/123</cell></row></table><note>PK/PD dataset from Study 202, Study 204, Study 310 and Study 311.

The 90% PIs of platelet count-time profiles following avatrombopag administration for each level of TPO and each dosing level showed comparable elevation in platelet count, and thus little impact of TPO on platelet count elevation. Secondary pharmacology A thorough QT study was conducted. No effect of avatrombpoag on the QTc interval was detected. Further, no cardiovascular effects of avatrombopag were detected in the clinical studies. A PK-QTcF interval analysis model could not integrate data adequately to support a credible model prediction. Irrespective of the lack of modelling of predicted effect on the QTc interval, clinical data demonstrate that avatrombopag has no effect on the QTc interval.Assessment report EMA/CHMP/322871/2019 Page 47/123</note></figure>

Overall, bioequivalence was Cmax and AUC was demonstrated although a plateau seemed to be reached at a (supratherapeutic) dose of 100 mg. Half-life vas an estimated 18-24 hours. Studies investigating the influence of food determined that variability of PK parameters was significantly reduced when avatrombopag was administered with food (high fat or low fat). Plasma binding of avatrombopag is high and ranging from 96.3%-96.6%. The apparent volume of distribution was 180L and avatrombopag displays broad intracellular distribution.

Additionally, avatrombopag was not found to be a substrate of transporters such as BCRP, BSEP or MRP2. The possible impact of avatrombopag on transporters OATP1B3, OAT1 or OAT3 (as suggested in vitro) was not investigated in vivo. Two in vivo interaction studies in healthy subjects were conducted. Study 008 investigated the effect of concomitant administration of strong P-gp inhibitors. A small difference in AUC between the two P-glycoprotein inhibitors was noted, however, data indicated that the impact was not considered clinical relevant. Study 019 investigated the effect of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 modulators. No detrimental effects on PK or PD of avatrombopag were observed. DDI effects were also simulated by the PBPK model in CLD patients and at clinically relevant doses. Concerning effects of CYP2C9 inhibition or induction, upper and lower margins of predicted platelet counts fell outside the presumed limits of safety and efficacy. Model data did not show an impact of acid reducing agents on avatrombopag PK.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Interactions:</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Assessment report</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>EMA/CHMP/322871/2019</cell><cell>Page 49/123</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

From the review of the blinded safety data of over 360 patients from Study 310 and Study 311, no TEAEs of PVT had occurred with &gt;3 times the expected number of patients needed to observe an expected event with an incidence of 1% . At that time, there was one non-treatment emergent AE of PVT in Study 310 that occurred 32 days after the last dose of study drug, which was assessed as not related to study drug by the investigator and Sponsor; the additional TEAE of PVT in an avatrombopag-treated patient in Study 311 that was not in the database at the time of the data cutoff would not have changed this safety assessment. There were also two PVTs that were identified in patients in screening prior to randomisation, which was consistent with the expected incidence of PVTs in this patient population.The risk of avatrombopag inducing or promoting fibrosis in the bone marrow is considered to be low in ITP patients. Since the time point of diagnosis of bone marrow fibrosis exceeded the intended 5 day treatment scheme of avatrombopag, no safety concerns with regard to bone marrow fibrosis raised from the submitted trials in ITP patients for the intended short-term use of avatrombopag. However, with the exception of one bleeding-related event in the placebo group, all AESI in Group 4 occurred in the</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="2">avatrombopag treatment group.
