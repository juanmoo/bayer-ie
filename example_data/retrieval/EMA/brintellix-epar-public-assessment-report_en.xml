The development of the manufacturing process of film-coated tablets 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg was performed at pilot scale on similar equipment used for production scale.</p><p>The film-coated tablets are packed in polyvinyl chloride/polyvinylidene chloride/aluminium (PVC/PVdC/alu) blisters and in high density polyethylene (HDPE) containers. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adventitious agents</head><p>No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacture of the product</head><p>The manufacturing process of the immediate release dosage form involves the following steps:</p><p>blending, fluid bed granulation, drying, blending, compression and film coating.</p><p>The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process.</p><p>Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Product specification</head><p>The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: description (visual), identification (HPLC, UV and FT-IR), uniformity of dosage units, assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), dissolution, water content and microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.).</p><p>The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.</p><p>Batch analysis results are provided for three pilot scale batches for each strength, confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability of the product</head><p>Stability data of three pilot scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions for 24 months at 25ºC/60% RH and intermediate conditions at 30°C/75% RH, and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40ºC/75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Oral drops</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmaceutical development</head><p>The aim was to develop an oral drops formulation with a concentration of 20 mg vortioxetine per ml to be administered with a dropper device corresponding to 20 drops for a dose of 20 mg vortioxetine.</p><p>Unlike the film-coated tablets where a hydrobromide salt of the active substance is used, the oral drops formulation contains vortioxetine DL-lactate as the active substance which shows higher solubility in polar solvents. The solubility is further increased due to the presence of hydroxypropylbetadex in the formulation. The substitution degree and the temperature necessary for interaction with the active substance were investigated and taken into consideration during the development. Both parameters were not found critical for the interaction between hydroxypropylbetadex and vortioxetine.</p><p>The other excipient, ethanol 96%, increases the number of drops per ml and at the same time serves as preservative. Various ratios were investigated and a concentration of 8.5% (w/v) gave the desired drop number of 20 drops/ml. The oral drops formulation is self-preserving which is confirmed with a test for efficacy of antimicrobial preservation. Purified water serves as vehicle for the formulation.</p><p>All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur.</p><p>standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC.</p><p>The formulation used in the clinical bioequivalence study was the same as the formulation used for marketing. The study also showed bioequivalence between the oral drops solution, 20 mg/ml and the 20 mg film-coated tablet formulation.</p><p>The primary packaging is an amber glass bottle with dropper applicator and child-proof screw cap. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adventitious agents</head><p>No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacture of the product</head><p>The manufacturing process consists of three main steps: preparation of the bulk solution, filtration and subsequent filling of the amber bottles. The manufacturing process is carried out protected from light.</p><p>The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process.</p><p>Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Product specification</head><p>The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form and include description (visual), identification (HPLC, UV), assay vortioxetine (HPLC), assay ethanol 96% (GC), degradation products (HPLC), dose and uniformity of dose of oral drops, pH (Ph. Eur.) and microbial quality( Ph. Eur.).</p><p>The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.</p><p>Batch analysis results are provided for three batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.</p></div>

The batches of medicinal product are representative to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.</p><p>Samples were tested for description, vortioxetine assay, ethanol assay, degradation products, dose and uniformity of dose of oral drops, pH, colour of solution and microbiological quality. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.</p><p>In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products and in-use stability studies were performed on two batches stored for up to 8 weeks after first opening of the bottles at 25°C/60% RH.</p><p>Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are acceptable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4.">Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects</head><p>Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Introduction</head><p>In the nonclinical program VOR was administered orally, subcutaneously (SC), intraperitoneally, and/or intravenously (IV) in aqueous solutions of hydroxypropyl-betacyclodextrin (vehicle) (HP-β-CD) to mice, rats, dogs, and rabbits.</p><p>Pivotal nonclinical toxicology studies were conducted with the hydrobromide (HBr) salt of VOR.</p><p>Nonclinical pharmacology studies were conducted with the HBr salt, except for the human ether-à-gogo-related gene (hERG) assay, where the hydrochloride salt was used. Since VOR was used in solution, no differentiation was made between salts. Thus, in this EPAR the term VOR (VOR) will be used, irrespective of the salt form used. Brintellix</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Pharmacology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary pharmacodynamic studies</head><p>The in vitro studies in recombinant cell lines showed that Vortioxetine acts as an antagonist at 5-HT3, 5-HT7, and 5-HT1D receptors, a partial agonist at 5-HT1B receptors, an agonist at 5-HT1A receptors, and as an inhibitor of the 5-HTT both in human and rats. When taking into account the unbound plasma concentration at doses of 20 mg of Vortioxetine attained in healthy volunteers following repeated administration (Cmax unbound = 1.3 nmol/L), the binding affinities for the h5-HT3 receptor and the h5-HTT are the only ones to be considered therapeutically relevant. At 10-fold higher free plasma concentration, however, 5-HT1A agonistic and 5-HT7 antagonistic effects come into play. In the in vitro functionality assays IC50/EC50 levels are several fold higher than the unbound plasma concentration at doses of 20 mg of Vortioxetine attained in healthy volunteers following repeated administration:</p><p>• the IC50 for the h5-HT3A antagonist activity is 7.7-fold higher</p><p>• the Kb for the h5-HT7 antagonist activity is still 346-fold higher</p><p>• the Kb for the h5-HT1D antagonist activity is 19-fold higher</p><p>• the in vitro partial agonist activity at the h5-HT1B receptor is observed at concentrations that are 92-up to 354-fold higher</p><p>• the in vitro EC50 for the h5-HT1A agonist activity is 153-fold higher</p><p>• the in vitro inhibitory activity of h5-HTT is seen at clinically relevant unbound plasma concentrations.</p><p>Vortioxetine has comparable potency at the human and rat 5-HTT, and 5-HT1B receptors, it is more potent (4-to 10-fold) as 5-HT3 and 5-HT1D receptor antagonist in the rat as compared to human and less potent (approximately 10-fold) as 5-HT1A receptor agonist and 5-HT7 receptor antagonist in the rat as compared to human. This may imply that the in vivo activities measured in the rat may be somewhat overestimated with respect to impact of 5-HT3 and 5-HT1D receptor antagonism and somewhat underestimated with respect to impact of 5-HT1A receptor agonism and 5-HT7 receptor antagonism as compared to effects in humans.</p><p>Vortioxetine did not reveal clinically relevant interaction with other targets when a broad panel of receptors was tested at concentration up to or above 1000 nM.</p><p>The pharmacologically active doses in acute mechanistic and behavioural studies are in general in the range of 2.5 to 20 mg/kg SC (plasma concentrations approximately 170-900 ng/mL according to Study 929-300 2111 042) corresponding to &gt;50% occupancy at the 5-HTT. In the low end of the dose range, inhibition of r5-HT3 receptors and r5-HTT is likely to account for the net pharmacological effects while inhibition of r5-HT1B and stimulation of r5-HT1A receptors and likely also inhibition of r5-HT1D and 5-HT7 receptors contribute to the net effect in the high end of the dose interval.</p><p>The ED50's for receptor occupancy are either at plasma exposures below (5-HT3), equal (5-HTT) or</p><p>As can be concluded from the in vivo mechanistic studies, acute i.v. dosing of Vortioxetine suppressed the firing activity of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons in rats (ED50 548 µg/kg). The effect is mediated via a 5-HT1A receptor-dependent mechanism and involving contribution of 5-HT3 receptor antagonism to the net effect of Vortioxetine in this assay.</p><p>Administration of Vortioxetine at a dose corresponding to 40%-50% 5-HTT occupancy produced a significant reduction in the firing activity of rat dorsal raphe neurons 5 to 10 hours following continous drug delivery by an implanted minipump. There is a rapid recovery from the neuronal suppression (recovery of the firing frequency to control levels at 24 hours and maintenance at these levels at 3, 7 and 15 days). Co-administration of Vortioxetine and the 5-HT3 receptor agonist SR57227 counteracted the acute inhibitory effect of vortioxetine on dorsal raphe nucleus firing and delayed recovery thus pointing to the involvement of 5-HT3 antagonistic activity.</p><p>Vortioxetine also showed an antidepressant or anxiolytic-like profile in following in vivo behavioural assays:</p><p>• Novelty-induced suppression of feeding in 129SvEvTac mice (MED = 5 mg/kg/day p.o., no effect at 20 mg/kg/day), accompanied by enhanced cell proliferation and maturation in the hippocampus • Mouse (NIH Swiss mice) forced swim test (15.8 mg/kg s.c.)</p><p>• Rat (SD) foot shock-induced ultrasonic vocalization (MED=3.9 mg/kg s.c.)</p><p>• Rat (SD) social interaction test (1 mg/kg p.o.  3 ng/ml).</p><p>Except for the rat social interaction test, the active doses are in the high end of the dose range, where more targets in addition to 5-HT3 receptor and the 5-HTT are expected to be involved in the pharmacological effects. Plasma exposures are available only for the rat social interaction test and they are slightly lower than the plasma exposures attained following a single clinical dose of 20 mg of Vortioxetine in healthy volunteers (Cmax = 8.03 ng/mL). Vortioxetine is active in the rat social interaction test at doses where the occupancy at the 5-HTT is less than 20%, which may be regarded as negligible, hence the effect is most likely mediated through 5-HT3 receptor antagonism.</p><p>The mouse marble burying test in CD-1 mice (s.c.) and the olfactory bulbectomised test in SD rats (p.o.) are considered failed tests as the respective positive controls failed to exhibit an effect.</p><p>Vortioxetine also failed to reverse the stress-induced hedonic deficit measured as intake of a sucrose solution in the rat chronic mild stress test (Wistar rats, i.p., 5 weeks), whereas the positive control compound, imipramine, 10 mg/kg/day, IP, was active.</p><p>Vortioxetine showed memory enhancing effects in a rat contextual fear-conditioning paradigm (5 mg/kg s.c.) and novel object recognition model (10 mg/kg s.c.) at doses corresponding to 5-HTT occupancies of about 90%. The SSRI, escitalopram, is also active in these assays in normal rats at 5-HTT occupancies greater than 90%.However, Vortioxetine unlike escitalopram and duloxetine recovers cognitive deficits in rats following 5-HT depletion even at doses as low as 0.1 mg/kg (corresponding to a 5-HTT occupancy less than 20%, 5-HT3 receptor mediated).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary pharmacodynamic studies</head><p>Vortioxetine demonstrates analgesic potential in models of pain with central sensitization (the mouse formalin model) and neuropathic pain (the rat chronic constriction nerve injury model), whereas there is no activity against inflammatory pain as assessed in the carrageenan paw model. Hence Vortioxetine shows potential as treatment of centrally mediated pain.</p><p>Most SSRIs and SNRIs cause treatment related sexual dysfunction. Consequently, Vortioxetine was tested in a sexual behaviour study in male rats. Unlike the SSRI fluoxetine, Vortioxetine did not significantly influence male rat sexual behaviour (noted a transient decrease in anticipatory level in the low-dose group and a slight non-statistically significant decrease in the number of ejaculations) in spite of high levels of 5-HTT occupancy with both drugs (70% for Vortioxetine as compared to 98% for fluoxetine), 8-9 hours after the last dose. In concert with the lack of fertility effects in reproduction toxicity investigations or on reproductive organs in multiple dose toxicity studies, these findings suggest a lower risk of sexual side effects of Vortioxetine than for SSRI or SNRI antidepressants (see below).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety pharmacology programme</head><p>Vortioxetine did not impair central nervous system function as evident by an Irwin test and the rotarod performance in rats. In behavioural studies in dogs, only sedation was noted at clinically relevant plasma exposures. This sign is consistent with observations noted in the toxicity studies.</p><p>In in vitro cardiovascular studies, Vortioxetine had a minor effect on currents of hERG (IC50 2538-fold higher than human unbound plasma exposure) and cloned human cardiac SCN5A sodium ion channels (IC50 715-fold higher than human unbound plasma exposure).</p><p>Vortioxetine administered to dogs in with single or sequential IV infusions induced minor prolongation of the PR intervals. As such, in the definitive study in conscious restrained male and female Beagle dogs at NOEL, plasma levels and AUC were, respectively, 1.4-fold higher and 7.5 fold lower than the values measured at doses of 20 mg of Vortioxetine attained in healthy volunteers (Cmax = 33 ng/mL).</p><p>At the NOEL of 0.94(initial)/0.08(maintenance) mg/kg iv. dose in the anesthetised female dog study, plasma levels were 14-fold higher than the plasma exposures measured at doses of 20 mg of Vortioxetine attained in healthy volunteers.</p><p>Likewise, PR-prolongations were observed upon oral vortioxetine administration in dog toxicity studies over 4 weeks (plasma exposure at the no-observed effect level=101/84 ng/mL for males/females, plasma levels are 3/2.5(M/F)-fold higher than the plasma exposures measured at doses of 20 mg of Vortioxetine attained in healthy volunteers) and 13 weeks. The effects on PR interval are noted at plasma exposures exceeding human the plasma exposures measured at doses of 20 mg of Vortioxetine attained in healthy volunteers by 4.6/6.3(M/F)-fold. PR-prolongations were however not observed in the clinical program. In anesthetized guinea pigs, no effects on pulmonary resistance or compliance were observed with IV doses up to 20 mg/kg. In freely moving rats, no biologically significant adverse effects were seen on respiratory parameters with doses up to 20 mg/kg <ref type="bibr">(PO, gavage)</ref>. No bronchoconstrictive effects of Vortioxetine were observed at PO doses ≤40 mg/kg. At 40 mg/kg, a significant reduction in the peak expiratory flow was observed.</p><p>Respiratory measurements in IV dosed conscious dogs showed that the pH of the arterial blood was reduced with a NOEL of 1.5 mg/kg (plasma levels are 3-fold higher than the plasma exposures measured at doses of 20 mg of Vortioxetine attained in healthy volunteers (Cmax = 33 ng/mL)). No statistically significant effects were observed in pCO2 and pO2 at plasma exposures below 210 ng/mL.</p><p>Vortioxetine had no pharmacodynamic renal effects in male and female rats at 20 mg/kg twice daily (BID) in a renal function study where Vortioxetine was administered for 5 days at oral doses up to 40 mg/kg BID. At 40 mg/kg BID, changes in sodium and chloride excretion and in urine osmolarity and albumin levels were noted. No changes in creatinine clearance were observed. At NOEL (20 mg/kg BID), plasma levels are 5.6/8.7(M/F)-fold higher than the plasma exposures measured at doses of 20 mg of Vortioxetine attained in healthy volunteers (Cmax = 33 ng/mL).</p><p>A gastrointestinal transit study in rats showed that VOR, 20, 40, and 100 mg/kg, PO, corresponding to respective average plasma levels of 198, 497, and 749 ng/mL, caused a dose-dependent decrease in gastric emptying but only a marginal reduction in charcoal transit in the small intestine. At these dose levels, plasma exposures are 1.4 up to 6.4-fold higher than the plasma exposures measured at doses of 20 mg of Vortioxetine attained in healthy volunteers (Cmax = 33 ng/mL).</p><p>In dogs, presumed abdominal pain (manifested by hunched back and discomfort during abdominal palpation) was observed at IV doses ≥1.5 mg/kg, corresponding to plasma exposures that are 3.2-fold higher than the plasma exposures measured at doses of 20 mg of Vortioxetine attained in healthy volunteers (Cmax = 33 ng/mL).</p><p>Consequently, gastrointestinal effects can be expected in the clinical setting and this is reflected in section 4.8 and 4.9 of the SmPC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacodynamic drug interactions</head><p>Conduct of nonclinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies with Vortioxetine were considered not to be relevant as pharmacodynamic drug interactions were addressed in clinical pharmacology studies.</p><p>This was considered acceptable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Pharmacokinetics</head><p>Pharmacokinetic properties of vortioxetine were predominantly investigated in mice, rats and dogs, i.e. species tested in toxicology studies, and were further compared using plasma and hepatocytes from rabbits, guinea pigs and Cynomolgus monkeys.</p><p>The oral absolute bioavailability was approximately 10% in the rat, 48% in the dog and 75% in patients, with terminal elimination half-life values of 3.0, 7.9 and 66 hours, respectively. In patients, the absorption was relatively slow (Tmax from 6 to 10h). Both in dogs and in rats there is a disproportionate increase in AUC after oral administration while in patients pharmacokinetics were dose-proportional. Consistent with the elimination half-life, Vortioxetine accumulates 5-to 6-fold in patients after multiple dosing. Gender differences in plasma Cmax and AUC were observed in rats and in mice after oral administration. Gender differences were first observed in one clinical study, however after normalisation to weight no more gender differences were observed in patients.</p><p>After repeated oral administration in rats and dogs, the half-life of Vortioxetine very significantly increased with dose which could suggest some kind of accumulation. However, PK data from a fourweek toxicology study in dogs resulted in a mean half-life similar to single dose administration. No accumulation was seen after single dose oral administration in the distribution study in rats. In patients, the half-life of Vortioxetine did not vary with oral dose after single or repeated administration.</p><p>Pharmacokinetics of two metabolites of Vortioxetine were studied in dogs. Lu AA34443 is the major metabolite in all species and in patients. Lu AA34994 is an intermediate that was identified in vitro but never detected in vivo. Lu AA34994 metabolism further leads to Lu AA34443.</p><p>Distribution studies with [ 14 C]Vortioxetine and drug-related material in male rats showed fast absorption and distribution to all organs and tissues. Vortioxetine binds to melanine and concentrations of drug-related material were higher in melanin containing tissues. Elimination of radioactivity over time occurred more rapidly in the albino Wistar Han rat as compared to the pigmented Lister Hooded rat, with approximately half the number of tissues being below the limit of quantification after 24 was high (98.8%) and similar to the plasma protein binding in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs (between 99.1% to 99.8%).</p><p>All metabolites detected in human hepatocytes were also present in dogs, mice and rats (plasma and/or urine) in vivo, except for a glucuronide conjugate of monohydroxy-Vortioxetine which was not found in mice or rats. Among all species tested, rabbit hepatocytes appeared to have the metabolite profile closer to human hepatocyte metabolite profile.</p><p>Vortioxetine and/or metabolites inhibited the following CYPs: CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 at high concentrations. Clinical trials assessing drug-drug interaction of Vortioxetine with regard to CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 did not demonstrate an inhibitory activity of the treatment on these enzymes.</p><p>Vortioxetine and related material was mainly excreted by faeces in mice (84 %), rats (69 %) and dogs (59-65 % in two separate studies), whereas humans showed prominent urinary excretion (59 %) compared to faeces (26 %). In excretion studies, the recovery of [ 14 C]Vortioxetine and related material was close to 100% in rodents. Dogs and humans exhibited a protracted excretion and the recovery was approximately 90% and 85% after 168 hours and 360 hours, respectively. Excretion in maternal milk was demonstrated in rats. This was included in the SmPC section 5.3, with a crossreference in section 4.6.</p><p>Studies were conducted to determine the composition and solubility of the crystalline material observed in the kidney and liver of rats and in the liver of mice in repeat-dose studies. The crystals were found to be composed of the carboxylic acid metabolite Lu AA34443 and M3 (glucuronide of Lu AA39835). It is concluded that the crystal formation was due to exceeded solubility of these metabolites. The M3 metabolite is only found in trace amounts in human feces and urine, in contrast to the high concentrations found in rodents. The mean concentration of Lu AA34443 in human urine is clearly below the determined solubility of this metabolite in human urine. It is thus considered that crystal formation is unlikely to occur in patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.4.">Toxicology</head><p>Toxicity studies with Vortioxetine ranging from single-dose studies up to 26-or 52-week repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted. The rat and dog were used as the primary rodent and non-rodent species, respectively.</p><p>A standard set of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies was performed and the carcinogenic potential of Vortioxetine was investigated in two 2-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats, respectively.</p><p>Potential effects on fertility and pre-and postnatal development were assessed in the rat and embryofetal developmental toxicity studies were conducted in the rat and the rabbit.</p><p>Other studies included immunotoxicity (as part of the 13-week rat toxicity study), intravenous (IV) 7and 14-day toxicity studies in rats and dogs, a local lymph node assay (LLNA) for assessment of skin sensitization in mice, and mechanistic toxicity studies in dogs (to address the convulsive episodes seen in this species) and rats (mechanistic evaluation of crystalline materials in liver and kidney).</p><p>Vortioxetine was administered orally to dogs and twice daily to rabbit, rat and mouse due to its relatively short plasma half-life in these species. Due to severe toxicity the dosing regimen was changed to once daily dosing for the mouse.</p><p>HP-β-CD was chosen as the vehicle for the formulations of Vortioxetine in order to enhance solubility and oral bioavailability. In the rabbit studies, vehicle-mediated effects on bodyweight, food consumption, and faeces were seen and in the rat carcinogenicity study, vehicle-mediated effects were seen in the large intestines. According to the literature, the main effects of oral administration of high doses of HP-β-CD are related to the large load of poorly digestable, osmotically active carbohydrates which leads to soft and/or loose faeces in rats and dogs and effects on bodyweight, food consumption, and faeces in rabbits. In addition, oral administration of HP-β-CD has effects on haematological and clinical chemistry parameters and induces histological changes in the gastrointestinal tract, liver, pancreas, and urinary tract.</p><p>Toxicokinetic (TK) profiling or proof of systemic exposure measurements of vortioxetine were performed in all pivotal studies. Additional TK measurements of metabolites were performed in selected studies.</p><p>All pivotal toxicity studies were conducted in compliance with GLP principles. GLP compliance is not claimed for all dose range-finding studies.</p><p>The bioanalytical phases of 10 nonclinical toxicity studies were affected by a case of misconduct during the conduct of the bioanalyses at a contract research organization. The misconduct resulted in 10 deficiencies relating to the bioanalytical work. GLP compliance cannot be claimed for the bioanalytical phases of the 10 nonclinical studies. However, based on the investigation and the remedial work of the Applicant, the overall conclusions of the studies are adequate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Single dose toxicity</head><p>Single dose toxicity studies were performed in the mouse and in the rat following oral or iv administration of LUAA21004. In both species, clinical signs related to CNS effects occurred rapidly after oral dosing and included marked sensitivity to touch, tremor, partly closed eye, rapid breathing, hypoactivity and perinasal staining. Clinical signs observed at doses higher than the MTD resulted in convulsions in both sexes after single oral or iv administration of LuAA21004. The MTD were 300 mg/kg (mouse) and 500 mg/kg (rat) after oral administration and between 20 and 30 mg/kg in both species following iv dosing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeat dose toxicity</head><p>Repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted ranging up to 26-or 52-weeks in mouse, rat and dog.</p><p>The main findings during the repeat-dose toxicity studies were clinical signs associated with the effect of Vortioxetine on the central nervous system (CNS) in all species and changes in the liver and kidneys of rodents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CNS effects</head><p>Clinical signs of convulsions were seen in the mouse in the non-pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies at dose of 200mg/kg/day. No convulsions and no other CNS clinical sign (except sporadic overactivity in female) were seen during 26 week treatment at daily dose up to 50 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg in the male and female mouse, respectively.</p><p>In the dogs, following oral administration of Vortioxetine, episodes of convulsions were observed in two females at 10 and 15 mg/kg/day doses, respectively, within the first days of treatment in the 13-week toxicity study. A no effect level for convulsions was established at 7.5 mg/kg/day in the 52-week dog study. This corresponded to a plasma exposure level 4.7 -fold the human exposure at the maximum recommended therapeutic dose of 20 mg/day Vortioxetine (AUC for single dose: 645.51, AUC for multiple dose: 646 ng.h/mL). A mechanistic study confirmed that the major metabolite of LuAA21004, LuAA34443, was not responsible for the convulsions seen in the dog following oral administration of LuAA21004. Taking into account the narrow dose range between the NOEL and the occurrence of convulsions (7.5 mg/kg/day vs 10 mg/kg/day) in this species and the fact that two episodes of convulsions were reported during clinical trial (although being of alternative ethiology), arisk of convulsions in human cannot be excluded and is reflected in the SmPC and followed up in the RMP.</p><p>In addition to convulsions, other LUAA21004-related CNS effects were seen in all the species used during repeat-dose toxicity studies. In the mouse, the principal clinical signs were tremor, hypoactivity, abdominal distension, noisy respiration, piloerection, ungroomed coat, and vocalization occurring at doses ≥ 50 mg/kg/day. In the rat, salivation was seen at all the doses tested. In the dogs, pupil dilatation/incomplete pupil contraction, was noted in both male and female at ≥ 3.75 mg/kg/day.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Kidney toxicity</head><p>Pale appearance and increase kidneys weight were observed in the mouse. With daily regimen increased kidneys weight was only seen during the 13 week study without any related-findings in blood chemistry/urinalysis parameters and histopathological examination.</p><p>In contrast, renal toxicity was found in the rat in the MTD, 13-and 26-week toxicity studies at 40 mg/kg BID and above. The toxic findings included glomerulonephritis and kidney changes indicative of renal tubular obstruction by crystals. There was evidence of an effect upon renal function as indicated by alteration of the urinary composition (production of higher volume of diluted urine, presence of blood, and variations of plasma and urinary electrolytes). After a 12-week treatment-free recovery period, kidney findings similar to those detected at the end of the 26-week treatment period were present in 1/6 males that received 40 mg/kg BID.</p><p>The risk to human is considered low, however, the non-clinical finding is considered a potential risk and followed up in the RMP</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Liver toxicity</head><p>In mice, repeat oral administration of LuAA21004 resulted in liver toxicity characterized by hepatocyte necrosis, presence of inflammatory cells, bile duct hyperplasia, crystalline material in bile ducts, and an increase in hepatocyte mitotic activity predominantly in the males. In female, cytoplasmic hepatocyte vacuolation was seen at dose of 200 mg/kg/day. With regard to liver toxicity the NOAEL for male mice was 50 mg/kg/day whereas it was 200 mg/kg/day in females.</p><p>Liver toxicity was also noticed in the rat. This included hepatocellular hypertrophy, hepatocyte necrosis, bile duct hyperplasia and presence of crystal material in the duct. With regards to liver necrosis the NOAEL was 10 mg/kg/BID in the rat. Based on this values a safety margin of LuAA21004 exposure levels was only 1.6-2.2 when compared to the human exposure following repeat oral administration of LuAA21004 at the maximum daily recommended dose of 20 mg.</p><p>Liver changes characterized as mild hepatocellular vacuolation were observed in dogs in the 4-week study, but were not confirmed in studies of longer duration. Changes in plasma aspartate aminotransferase activity and glucose and protein concentrations suggesting an effect upon the liver were observed in the 13-week toxicity study but these were not related to any histopathological changes.</p><p>The liver findings in rodents (focal hepatocyte necrosis) are considered related to the crystalline precipitation of the metabolites Lu AA34443 and M3 at dosages of 20 mg/kg BID (rats) and 100 mg/kg/day (mice) and above.</p><p>Since focal hepatocyte necrosis is very common in mice and rats and since they also occur following bile duct obstruction in rats <ref type="bibr">(Kountouras et al., 1984)</ref>, the focal necrosis may be viewed as part of the other histopathological changes. Furthermore, crystal precipitation is considered not likely to occur in humans at therapeutic dose levels the liver findings in rodents are considered only to pose a low risk to humans. The aetiology of the hepatocellular vacuolation observed in dogs in the 4-week study at a dose of 15 mg/kg is not known. However, these changes were mild and no histopathology changes have been observed in the 13-and 52-week study in dogs. Furthermore, they were observed at exposure levels which are approximately 8-fold to the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose. Therefore, the relevance to humans is limited.</p><p>A wording is proposed for section 5.3.</p><p>Crystal formation containing LuAA34443 and M3 was confirmed in the rat renal tubules and bile ducts.</p><p>These were considered to represent major routes of excretion of Vortioxetine and/or a metabolite. In rats, the concentration of Lu AA34443 in urine occasionally exceeded the solubility limit explaining the crystal formation in rats, while the concentration of Lu AA34443 in urine in dogs was below the solubility limit; no renal crystal formation was noted in dogs. In human urine, the concentration of Lu AA34443 was 10-fold lower than the solubility limit. All together these data suggested a rodent-specific effect for the crystal formation that is unlikely to occur in patients with normal renal function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other effects</head><p>In the 4-week repeat dose toxicity study in rats (Study 10194) histopathological investigation indicated findings in the salivary glands (degranulation of the striated ducts, acinar degranulation and/or acinar atrophy) in animals receiving 20 or 40 mg/kg b.i.d. and, to a lesser extent, 10 mg/kg b.i.d. These findings were considered to have been induced by the increased incidence of salivation noted in the treated groups rather than a result of systemic toxicity. The Applicant therefore considers these histopathological and clinical findings to be of no toxicological importance. However, degranulation of striated submandibular salivary gland ducts and acinar athrophy of the sublingual salivary glands were also noted in the 14-day toxicity study in rats after i.v. administration of vortioxetine <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Study 10305)</ref> with no clinical signs of salivation. The morphology of the salivary gland changes in the 4-week and 14-day studies points towards a functional response of the glands induced by release of neurotransmitters more than a direct toxic effect of the treatment with vortioxetine. This is also in agreement with data from the literature. As such, increased levels of 5-HT due to the pharmacological effect of vortioxetine may have augmented the changes in the salivary gland epithelium. The lack of salivary gland changes in the 13-and 26-week oral toxicity studies in rats is a possible adaption to the dosing procedure and subsequent disappearance of the changes in the salivary gland. This has been confirmed by incidences of salivation recorded in the studies. In the 4-week and 13-week studies maximal incidences were observed in weeks 2-4 and 3-4, respectively, thereafter the incidences decreased in the 13-week study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genotoxicity</head><p>Vortioxetine (Lu A21004) was tested in a standard battery according to ICH S2 guidelines. There was no evidence for any genotoxic potential of Vortioxetine.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Carcinogenicity</head><p>In the mouse carcinogenicity study, once daily oral administration of Vortioxetine at 50 mg/kg/day in males produced an increased incidence of benign neoplastic change in terms of hepatocellular adenomas in the liver. At this dose in males and, to a lesser extent, at 100 mg/kg/day in females there was crystalline material in the lumen of the biliary system, which caused a range of secondary inflammatory changes, as a result of irritancy, in the hepatobiliary system. The increased incidence of benign neoplastic changes in the high dose males was considered likely to be mediated by a nongenotoxic mechanism of persistent hepatotoxicity. There was a clear no-effect level for tumourformation related to treatment with Vortioxetine at 15 mg/kg/day in males and 100 mg/kg/day in females. The NOAEL in this study, considering both neoplastic and non-neoplastic changes, was 15 mg/kg/day in males and 30 mg/kg/day in females.</p><p>In the rat carcinogenicity study, neoplastic findings related to oral administration of LuAA2100 were observed in the liver and mesenteric lymph node.</p><p>In the liver, a slight increase of hepatocellular adenomas was observed in the high dose groups. The treatment had no effect on the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas, and there was a clear no-effectlevel for the hepatocellular adenoma (7 mg/kg b.i.d. in males and 15 mg/kg b.i.d. in females) thus suggesting a non-genotoxic mechanism of persistent hepatotoxicity.</p><p>In the mesenteric lymph node, males given 7 or 20 mg/kg b.i.d. showed an increased incidence of benign neoplastic lesions (benign haemangioma), and angiomatous hyperplasia was also reported for the high dose males. There was no effect in females. This could potentially be attributed to the hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin-induced increase in cholecystokinin, a peptide that can act locally as a mitogen in rats, but not in mice, non-human primates and man. Moreover, a role is also being attributed to gastrointestinal mucosal inflammation also due to hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin. It could thus be hypothesized that angiogenic factors from the inflamed intestinal mucosa or increased levels of cholecystokinin has stimulated endothelial cell proliferation locally in the mesenteric lymph node and thereby played a role in the development of the haemangiomas. Whilst mesenteric lymph node haemangioma is a well described spontaneous tumour in rats that is most common in males with incidences up to 73 % in male rats in life-time studies; lymph node angiomas in humans are extremely rare, not reported in mesenteric lymph nodes, more common in females than males. There is no evidence to support that the occurrence of mesenteric lymph node angiomas in rats are relevant for humans. Vortioxetine is non-genotoxic, no proliferative vascular lesions have been observed in the chronic toxicity studies and there is no increase in malignant vascular neoplasms in rodent studies.</p><p>However, benign haemangiomas were seen to occur dose dependently in male rats only. In the absence of a clear clinical correlate, therefore, these findings are considered to be of low clinical relevance.</p><p>Non-neoplastic findings related to LUAA21004 identical to that observed in general toxicity studies were found in the liver, kidneys, bile duct, as well as in the stomach (dilated glands), and the mesenteric lymph node (sinus histiocytosis, hyperplasia). In the rat, considering both neoplastic and non-neoplastic findings, the NOAEL was 2 mg/kg b.i.d. in males and 15 mg/kg b.i.d. in females.</p><p>All of the treatment-related increases in tumor incidences seen in mouse or rat were small and involved only benign lesions and none of the findings noted indicate a carcinogenic potential for represented a safety margin of 16 following repeat oral administration of Vortioxetine at the daily maximum human recommended dose (20 mg). Nevertheless, as vortioxetine comparably affects serotonin levels as the pharmacologically related class of SSRIs, it seems reasonable to include a warning for a potentially impaired sperm quality in section 4.6 of the SmPC in accordance with the recently adopted requirements of the PhVWP.</p><p>Embryo-foetal development studies were performed in both rat and rabbit following oral administration of Lu AA21001 (from 5 up to 80 mg/kg/bid in the rat, from 1 up to 30 mg/kg/bid in the rabbit).</p><p>In the rat, Vortioxetine was found to reduce maternal body weight gain during gestation and to elicit body weight loss and decreased foetal weight at doses ≥ 60 mg/kg/bid. In the rabbit, maternal toxicity characterized by marked body weight losses and reduction in food consumption was seen at all doses tested (≥ 1mg/kg/bid) and decreased foetal weight was observed at doses ≥ 15 mg/kg/bid.</p><p>Meningoceles were seen in 3 foetuses from different litters of the 10 mg/kg/bid mid dose group and the incidence of this finding (2.5%) was above the historical foetal rabbit background data (0.0-1.3%).</p><p>This occurred at levels exposures comparable to that measured in human at maximum daily recommended dose of 20mg. The NOAEL with regard to meningocele occurrence was 5mg/kg/bid in the rabbit and a safety margin was absent. Moreover, a case of meningocele was also seen in a rat foetus from a low dose group, which was not found in historical background data for foetal rat abnormalities. The relevance of these rare findings for humans is questionable taking into account that this finding is not dose dependent and that pharmacological and toxicological data (including results from the pre-and postnatal toxicity study) do not suggest a bell-shaped dose response curve in animals.</p><p>Significant increase in the incidence of dilated ureters was seen in the rat foetuses starting at low dosed group. This is considered a transient effect on development and not to a related treatment effect, and it occurred in the absence of maternal toxicity. In addition, increased incidence of bilobed gall bladders was also seen in rabbit foetuses. This finding is considered incidental and unrelated to treatment although the incidence at the HD level in one study exceeds historical control incidence by more than 2-fold. A subsequent rabbit embryofoetal development study has failed to demonstrate a similar increase at a higher dose level.</p><p>An increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities and variants, predominantly associated with the state of ossification (incomplete and/or non-ossification), mainly concerning the sternum, cervical and thoracic vertebrae and the bone skull, was observed in foetuses of both species. These skeletal findings appeared correlated with the disruption in maternal bodyweight performance.</p><p>Based on the above findings, a potential risk of delayed foetal development in humans cannot be excluded. This was reflected in the SmPC.</p><p>Pre-and postnatal study with Vortioxetine was performed in the rat. Bodyweight and bodyweight gain were reduced in pups from dams treated with 60 mg/kg BID. Vortioxetine (≥ 5 mg/kg/bid) showed adverse effects on pup development at doses which did not result in maternal toxicity.</p><p>The findings included increased pup mortality, reduced bodyweight gain, and delayed eye opening. The effect of Vortioxetine on pup mortality was achieved at exposures similar to those achieved in human at the daily recommended dose (20mg). Based on these findings, a potential risk to humans cannot be excluded.</p><p>In all repeat-dose toxicity studies, NOAELs have been established and the systemic exposures at these NOAELs with regard to the human exposure at the maximum therapeutic dose (20 mg/day) were determined. Following concerns regarding the NOAELs established for some reproduction toxicity studies the Applicant has recalculated the NOAELs of the embryo-fetal developmental studies in rats and rabbits and in the pre-postnatal study in rat and a wording for section 5.3 is proposed.</p><p>A toxicity study following oral administration of Vortioxetine was done in juvenile rats from day 21 to day 91 of age. There were no treatment-related findings on reproductive parameters. Both liver and kidneys were identified as major target organs. Histopathological changes were seen in the liver and kidneys in terms of minimal hepatocellular centrilobular hypertrophy and vacuolation and minimal corticomedullar mineralization, respectively. Corticomedullary mineralization was mainly seen in female .rats but this finding was not evident in studies where adult rats were previously treated with Vortioxetine. The reduction in incidence in the high dose female group following cessation of treatment suggested a partial reversal of this finding. The precise mechanism underlying this observation was unclear and may be associated with a change in hormone levels in the females.</p><p>The survival and clinical condition of the offspring born to parents previously treated at high dose of</p><p>Vortioxetine were clearly inferior to those of offspring in the control group and those born to parents previously treated at 20 or 10 mg/kg/ b.i.d. In addition, such offspring showed clinical sign (cold to touch, no milk in the stomach) that was not observed in the offspring of animals treated with the control vehicle. In term of exposure levels this corresponded to a safety margin of only 4. A treatment related effect cannot be ruled out and this finding was described under section 5.3 of the SmPC, even if the current indication only concerns adult population and BRINTELLIX is not recommended in children under 18 years of age.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Local tolerance</head><p>Since the intended route for administration of BRINTELLIX in patients is oral, data from local tolerance studies are irrelevant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other toxicity studies</head><p>The repeated dose toxicity studies studies did not indicate potential immunotoxicity studies in mouse, rat and dog. Therefore, no specific studies are required to assess potential immunotoxic effects of Vortioxetine.</p><p>Nonclinical studies show that Vortioxetine at a high dose produced an increase in extracellular dopamine in the medial prefrontal cortex, but failed to activate other parts of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway including the nucleus accumbens. These findings support that Vortioxetine is devoid of dependence liability. Furthermore, no discontinuation symptoms were observed in animal studies. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.6.">Discussion on non-clinical aspects</head><p>The mechanism of action of vortioxetine is thought to be related to its direct modulation of serotonergic receptor activity and inhibition of the serotonin (5-HT) transporter. Non-clinical data indicate that vortioxetine is a 5-HT 3 , 5-HT 7 , and 5-HT 1D receptor antagonist, 5-HT 1B receptor partial agonist, 5-HT 1A receptor agonist and inhibitor of the 5-HT transporter, leading to modulation of neurotransmission in several systems, including predominantly the serotonin and also the norepinephrine, dopamine, histamine, acetylcholine, GABA and glutamate systems. This multimodal activity is considered responsible for the antidepressant and anxiolytic-like effects and the improvement of cognitive function, learning and memory observed with vortioxetine in animal studies.</p><p>However,the precise contribution of the individual targets to the observed pharmacodynamic profile remains unclear and caution should be applied when extrapolating animal data directly to man.</p><p>Administration of vortioxetine in the general toxicity studies in mice, rats and dogs was mainly associated with CNS-related clinical signs. These included salivation (rat and dog), pupil dilatation (dog), and two incidences of convulsions were noted in dogs during the general toxicity study program.</p><p>A no-effect level for convulsions was established with a corresponding safety margin of 5 considering the maximum recommended therapeutic dose of 20 mg/day. Target organ toxicity was restricted to kidneys (rats) and liver (mice and rats). The changes in the kidney in rats (glomerulonephritis, renal tubular obstruction, crystalline material in renal tubule) and in the liver of mice and rats (hepatocellular hypertrophy, hepatocyte necrosis, bile duct hyperplasia, crystalline material in bile ducts) were seen at exposures more than 10-fold (mice) and 2-fold (rats) the human exposure at the maximum recommended therapeutic dose of 20 mg/day. These findings were mainly attributed to rodent-specific vortioxetine-related crystalline material obstruction of the renal tubules and the bile ducts, respectively, and considered of low risk to humans.</p><p>Vortioxetine was not genotoxic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests.</p><p>Based on results from conventional 2-year carcinogenicity studies in mice or rats, vortioxetine is not considered to pose a risk of carcinogenicity in humans.</p><p>Vortioxetine had no effect on rat fertility, mating performance, reproductive organs, or sperm morphology and motility. Vortioxetine was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits, but reproductive toxicity in terms of effects on foetal weight and delayed ossification were seen in the rat at exposures more than 10-fold the human exposure at the maximum recommended therapeutic dose of 20 mg/day.</p><p>Similar effects were seen in the rabbit at sub-therapeutic exposure.</p><p>In a pre-and post-natal study in rats, vortioxetine was associated with increased pup mortality, reduced bodyweight gain, and delayed pup development at doses that did not result in maternal toxicity and with associated exposures similar to those achieved in humans following administration of vortioxetine 20 mg/day.</p><p>Vortioxetine-related material was distributed to the milk of lactating rats.</p><p>In juvenile toxicity studies in rats, all vortioxetine treatment-related findings were consistent with those noted in adult animals.</p><p>On the available ERA data provided the CHMP concluded that Brintellix is expected to pose a risk for the environment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The pharmacokinetic properties of vortioxetine have been characterised across studies using both noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis and population PK analysis.</p><p>The clinical pharmacology package for vortioxetine consists of 10 human biomaterial studies and 31 clinical pharmacology studies evaluating the pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics of vortioxetine in humans.</p><p>In the 31 clinical pharmacology studies, 1169 subjects received vortioxetine: 1120 healthy subjects (of whom 48 were elderly aged 65 to 78 years), 16 subjects with hepatic impairment, and 33 subjects with renal impairment.</p><p>Three additional studies (Studies 14029A, CPH-004 and Study 14520A) had been completed as of 31</p><p>August 2013.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine have been evaluated following oral administration of immediate release (IR) tablets in single doses of 2.5 to 75mg and multiple doses of 2.5 to 60mg/day. In addition, an intravenous formulation, an oral drops solution, oral solutions, and two alternative experimental enteric-coated tablet formulations have been administered in the clinical pharmacology studies.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic data for the enteric-coated formulations are not presented in this Marketing Authorisation Application, since the sponsor is not seeking marketing authorisation for these formulations. However, the pharmacokinetic data for the IR tablet formulations collected in those studies are included in the population pharmacokinetic analysis, and in the pooled descriptive statistics of the non-compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters.</p><p>The effect of intrinsic factors (race, gender, age, hepatic and renal impairment, CYP450 genotype) has been investigated by the applicant.</p><p>Multiple pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of other compounds on vortioxetine as well as the effect of vortioxetine on other compounds.</p><p>Two population pharmacokinetic analyses have been performed for vortioxetine: one analysis used data from 26 clinical pharmacology studies and a second analysis was performed on the more sparse pharmacokinetic data that were obtained in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in 12 phase II/III clinical efficacy and safety studies.</p><p>Subsequently, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analyses were conducted to assess the relationships between exposure and efficacy/tolerability for vortioxetine in patients with MDD.</p><p>The analytical methods used to analyse vortioxetine and its major metabolites have been well </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Absorption</head><p>Vortioxetine is highly soluble in aqueous media. Taking into account the high intestinal permeability</p><p>suggested by the mass balance study, vortioxetine could be categorized as a Class I (highly soluble, highly permeable) drug according to the BCS classification system.</p><p>Vortioxetine is slowly absorbed after oral administration of IR tablets or solution. Following single and multiple oral doses of 5, 10, or 20mg (IR tablets), median t max values of 7 to 11 hours were observed.</p><p>The reported absolute bioavailability (BA) was approximately 75%. The administration of 20 mg vortioxetine did not have a statistically significant effect on gastric emptying, but did have a statistically significant pro-kinetic effect on small intestinal transit and subsequent colon arrival (mean decrease of approximately 1 to 2 hours depending on the radioactive marker and time of measurement).</p><p>Differences in AUC and tmax across studies are still within the acceptable ranges and these differences have no implications on the conclusions of the individual studies.</p><p>Bioequivalence (BE) of the tablets used in early development stage as well as in the pivotal clinical studies and those intended for marketing could be considered demonstrated. In addition, no difference in absorption is expected for the different strengths of the to-be-marketed formulation. The food effect has been explored during two studies (of which two with the formulation intended to be marketed);</p><p>results indicated that there is no effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distribution</head><p>Following single and multiple doses of vortioxetine, the estimated volume of distribution (Vz/F) is approximately 2500 to 3400 L, which indicates extensive extravascular distribution of vortioxetine.</p><p>Vortioxetine binds extensively (&gt;98%) to plasma proteins in vitro and appears to be independent from the plasma concentrations. In addition, ex vivo protein binding experiments using samples from subjects with hepatic or renal impairment showed that no difference could be observed in comparison with healthy subjects.</p><p>The in vitro plasma protein binding of Vortioxetine and Lu AA34443 in human plasma was investigated in Studies 12287 and 14179 and was found to be independent of concentration in the ranges of 10 to 12000ng free base/mL (Vortioxetine) and 5 to 4500ng free base/mL (Lu AA34443). At steady state, the Cmax in humans following 20mg Vortioxetine is approximately 33 ng/mL for both compounds.</p><p>Therefore, it is not likely that the binding sites are saturated at these concentrations and, consequently, displacement of one of the compounds by the other, or by other drugs, is unlikely.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Elimination</head><p>The estimated total plasma clearance of vortioxetine was approximately 500 to 670 mL/min. The mean half-life was estimated to 60 to 70 hours following single and multiple doses of vortioxetine. Because of its long elimination half-life, the risk of PK interactions can persist for several days or even weeks after vortioxetine withdrawal. However, as vortioxetine did not show any relevant potential for inhibition or induction, this is not a concern.</p><p>The mass balance study indicated that the mean recovery of 14 C-radioactivity was 85% in 360 hours, with approximately 59% excreted in the urine and 26% in faeces. Vortioxetine and radioactivity levels declined with similar rates. The extent of systemic exposure to vortioxetine, based upon mean AUC 0-t ,</p><p>accounted for approximately 13% of the total exposure to radioactivity in plasma. Furthermore, the combined extent of systemic exposure to vortioxetine and Lu AA34443 accounted for approximately 27% of the total exposure to radioactivity in plasma. Vortioxetine is extensively metabolised and the major biotransformation pathway seem to be oxidation to the major metabolite, Lu AA34443 followed by glucuronic acid conjugation.</p><p>As approximately all radioactivity could be attributed to vortioxetine and the identified metabolites, there is no risk for unidentified metabolites potentially impairing the safety profile of vortioxetine.</p><p>From the results of the mass balance study it is clear that the pathway leading to Lu AA34443 and subsequently to its glucuronide is by far the major one. The three other pathways are minor ones, contributing to only 3% of the metabolism of vortioxetine.</p><p>A large number of enzymes (CYP3A4/5, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, and CYP2B6) can catalyse the clearance of vortioxetine in CYP2D6 PMs.</p><p>In vitro experiments indicated that several CYP isoenzymes are involved in the metabolism of vortioxetine: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4/5, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2B6. Also UGT is playing a role in the conjugation reactions of vortioxetine metabolites.</p><p>Genotyping for CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 alleles was performed in most of the clinical pharmacology studies to evaluate the potential relationship between the inferred metabolic status and the pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine. In general, although not consistent, the poor metabolisers (PMs) for CYP2D6 showed the highest AUC values for vortioxetine and the lowest for Lu AA34443. In addition, a 47% lower CL/F in CYP2D6 PMs than in Ems (extensive metaboliser) has been observed.</p><p>The approximately 2-fold higher vortioxetine exposure in CYP2D6 PMs does not translate into significant changes in the safety and tolerability profile of vortioxetine relative to that in CYP2D6 EMs according to the applicant. However, the frequency of some adverse effects is doubled in the PM group versus EM group, like for dizziness and pruritus and the DDI study with bupropion showed a higher incidence of adverse events due to the 2-fold higher vortioxetine exposure when bupropion was added to vortioxetine in steady state.</p><p>It is the Applicant's view that Vortioxetine is well tolerated. The majority of the adverse events were transient and mild or moderate. A subgroup analysis showed no clinically relevant differences in the tolerability profiles between the overall population and healthy subjects genotyped as CYP2D6 PMs or patients categorised as low-clearance patients (covering exposure in CYP2D6 PMs) based on their pharmacokinetic data. The incidences of nausea, vomiting, and insomnia were not higher in the subpopulations categorised as low clearance patients.</p><p>Hence, the overall dose recommendations in the product information seem adequate, that is, a recommended dose of 10mg with a possibility of a reduction to 5mg based on individual patient response. As a consequence, CYP2D6 genotyping/phenotyping, changes in titration, or therapeutic drug monitoring are not considered to be of clinical relevance. The currently recommended dose regimen is considered both appropriate and manageable for the prescriber.</p><p>In the population pharmacokinetic analysis in healthy subjects (Population Pharmacokinetics of Vortioxetine in Healthy Subjects [PopPK phase I]), the oral clearance for CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers (UMs) was estimated to 52.9L/h compared to 34.1L/h for CYP2D6 EMs, which gives a ratio of 1.55. Consequently, the CYP2D6 UMs will have a 36% lower Vortioxetine exposure than CYP2D6 EMs. For a starting dose of 10mg, CYP2D6 UMs will, in general, still have exposure levels above those expected in CYP2D6 EMs following the therapeutic dose of 5mg Vortioxetine. The CHMP agreed that in CYP2D6 UMs, the exposure levels are still sufficient for an adequate efficacy. Concerning safety, an analysis of tolerability versus exposure in the MDD Short-term studies was conducted dividing the patients into 3 groups based on their clearance of Vortioxetine. High-clearance patients were defined as the 10% of patients with the lowest exposure (covering exposure in UMs) and their overall tolerability was the same as the other groups of metabolisers.</p><p>No clinically significant changes in exposure are observed in relation with the CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 inferred metabolic status.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dose and time dependency</head><p>There was an approximately dose-proportional increase in AUC and C max , over the range of single dose 2.5 -75 mg/day and multiple dose 2.5 -60 mg/day both in single dose as in multiple dose settings.</p><p>The accumulation index (AI) for vortioxetine (based on AUC 0-24h ) was estimated to be 5 to 6 following multiple doses of 5 to 20 mg/day, which is consistent with its long half-life. Steady state is reached after approximately 12 days of once daily administration of vortioxetine. No time dependency has been observed for the other pharmacokinetic parameters of vortioxetine.</p></div>

The goal of the analysis was to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models (efficacy/safety) for vortioxetine following oral administration of 1-20 mg doses of vortioxetine in patients with MDD and GAD.</p><p>In According to the applicant, these findings cannot be explained by differences in demographic factors (weight, BMI, or CrCL) and indicate a higher rate of non-compliance in studies conducted in the United States compared to those conducted in Europe or RoW. In contrast, in the phase I population pharmacokinetic analysis, region was not identified as a significant covariate, which further support that the regional difference found in patients is most likely due to the less controlled study conditions in the patient studies.</p><p>Based on the population pharmacokinetic analyses, the pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine was similar in healthy subjects and in patients with MDD or GAD.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special populations • Renal impairment</head><p>Vortioxetine is almost completely cleared by metabolism. According to the results from study 112, the effects of renal impairment (mild, moderate, severe, or ESRD) on the pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine after single dose are not considered clinically meaningful. The CHMP agrees that the observed effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine after single dose are not altered to such an extent that the dosage should be adjusted.</p><p>With regard to the significant accumulation of vortioxetine, the applicant has justified the choice of a single dose to study renal impairment and has discussed the potential consequences of a multiple dose vortioxetine administration in patients with renal impairment. The applicant's answer was endorsed.</p><p>According to the EMA Guidelines on the evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products in patients with impaired hepatic and renal functions, a single dose study is sufficient when the product exhibits linear and time-independent pharmacokinetics.</p><p>There is an accumulation ratio index of 5 to 6 following multiple doses of 5 to 20 mg/day for vortioxetine AUC0-24h but this does not lead to a time-dependent PK as the parameters CL and V ss do not change with time. This accumulation ratio is added in section 5.2. The differences in exposure after single dose are low and no clinically relevant differences are expected after multiple dose administration.</p></div>

However, the effects of hepatic impairment on vortioxetine are not in line with the results of the other studies of the pharmacology program. The mass balance study implied elimination by almost complete hepatic metabolisation and renal excretion of the metabolites. Consequently an increase of the extent of exposure for vortioxetine would have been expected, but the AUC and Cmax remain unchanged or are slightly even lowered for both hepatic impairment groups. The Applicant acknowledges that the lack of influence of hepatic insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics of Vortioxetine and the metabolites Lu AA39835 and Lu AA34443 may appear unexpected. There is no obvious explanation for the lack of increase in Vortioxetine exposure in the hepatic impairment groups.</p><p>The severity of hepatic impairment has been adequately described by the applicant in the context of Child-Pugh score for subjects included in study 114. There was no obvious correlation between the pharmacokinetic parameters and the Child-Pugh score.</p><p>The patients with severe hepatic impairment were not studied. In these patients, a clinically significant increase of exposure to vortioxetine and/or their metabolites cannot be ruled out. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to patients with severe hepatic impairment. This is well mentioned in </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Gender</head><p>Gender differences exist in the PK of antidepressants in men and women. Reduced expression and inhibition of many of the phase I enzymes necessary for the metabolism of antidepressants has been shown to result in higher serum levels of antidepressants in women. In terms of physiological differences, women have a generally lower body weight and organ size and a higher percentage of fat, factors which are known to affect distribution.</p><p>In study n°10467, the exposure to vortioxetine seemed to be slightly higher in women than in men following multiple doses of 40mg/day but the results are inconclusive based on the limited data from this study. According to the applicant, the small differences in exposure to vortioxetine may be attributed to the difference in body weight between men and women (men weights ranged from 62 to 105 kg compared to 47 to 85 kg for women) and this gender-related difference was no longer significant after weight correction.</p><p>In study CPH-001, there were no consistent differences in the exposure or CLr between male and female subjects. In study n°111, following single doses, the AUC0-t and Cmax of Vortioxetine were 18% and 16% higher, respectively, in women than in men. Following multiple doses, the AUC0-24h</p><p>and Cmax of Vortioxetine were 27% and 24% higher, respectively, in women than in men.</p><p>In the phase I population pharmacokinetic analysis, sex was not a significant covariate in the final model. The modest, sex-related increases in Vortioxetine exposure in Study 111 are not considered clinically meaningful by the applicant.</p><p>It can be concluded that no clinically relevant changes related to sex were observed for vortioxetine, neither in the non-compartmental studies, neither in the POP PK analysis.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Race</head><p>Since CYP2D6 is the main isoform responsible for the metabolism of vortioxetine and the prevalence of the various phenotypes and genotypes are different among different ethnic groups (African, Hispanic and Asian populations), the possible effects of race on the pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine were considered.</p><p>In study n°111, following multiple doses, the AUC0-24h and Cmax of Vortioxetine were 25% and 33% higher, respectively, in Black subjects than in White subjects.</p><p>In study n° 12260A, following multiple doses, AUC0-24h and Cmax of Vortioxetine were slightly higher (8% and 9%, respectively) in Japanese subjects than in Caucasian subjects.</p><p>The CHMP agrees that no clinically meaningful changes in Vortioxetine exposure related to race or ethnicity were observed in Study n°12260A (Asian population) and in study n°111 (black versus white).</p><p>However, when we compare the PK parameters across studies of the both phase I ascending dose studies CPH001 and 10272, carried out respectively in Japanese healthy subjects and in a majority of Hence, as assessed in the population pharmacokinetic analyses, both in healthy subjects and in patients with MDD/GAD, the impact of height, weight, and/or LBM on the central volume of distribution and oral clearance, and thereby on exposure, is not considered clinically relevant. Based on this, it can be concluded that the benefit/risk is unchanged in these groups.</p><p>In general, there was very good agreement between the pharmacokinetic parameter values estimated by population pharmacokinetic analysis and those estimated by non-compartmental analysis (NCA).</p><p>Following single and multiple doses of Vortioxetine, the volume of distribution (Vz/F) was estimated to approximately 2500 to 3400L using NCA. The extensive distribution of Vortioxetine was confirmed in the phase I population pharmacokinetic analysis, in which the sum of the volumes of distribution in the central (V2/F) and peripheral (V3/F) compartments was approximately 2600L. Using NCA, the estimated CL/F of Vortioxetine was approximately 30 to 40L/h and the t½ was estimated to 60 to 70 hours following single or multiple doses of Vortioxetine. In the phase I population pharmacokinetic analysis, the overall population mean CL/F was estimated to 33L/h and the t½ was 66 hours. The applicant's argumentation is mainly based on the population PK model in volunteers and patients with MDD/GAD and can be considered as sufficient to conclude that the impact of height and weight on the central volume of distribution is not considered clinically relevant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Age</head><p>Antidepressants being among the most commonly prescribed medicinal products for older agents, agerelated changes in drug PK parameters should be adequately investigated. In general, PK changes that accompany aging result in higher and more variable plasma drug concentrations.</p><p>For vortioxetine, Cmax was 23% higher and AUC0-24h was 27% higher in elderly than in young subjects on day 28 in study n°111. Based on the results of the non-compartmental studies and the phase I population PK analysis, the modest age-related increases in Vortioxetine exposure, are not considered clinically meaningful by the applicant.</p><p>However, the applicant was asked to provide a stratification based on age to evaluate the impact of age on PK parameters in the three ranges of age (65-74), (75-84) and 85+ and to provide the proportion of very elderly (&gt; 85 -year old) subjects.

A potential effect of inferred metabolic status for CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP2C9 was assessed in the phase I population pharmacokinetic analysis.

Vortioxetine has therefore a low potential for clinically relevant interactions with other drugs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of other compounds on the Pharmacokinetics of Vortioxetine</head><p>For bupropion (Study 117), rifampicin (Study 115), ketoconazole, and fluconazole (for AUC only) (Study 103), the 90% CIs for Cmax and AUC were outside the limits of 80% to 125%.</p><p>The approximately 2-fold increase in Vortioxetine exposure following co-administration with a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (bupropion) is comparable to the higher exposure in CYP2D6 PMs, relative to CYP2D6</p><p>Ems. These observations are reflected in the SmPC where it is mentioned that depending on individual patient response, a lower dose of vortioxetine may be considered if strong inhibitors are added to vortioxetine treatment.</p><p>According to the guideline on the Investigation of Drug Interactions, CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev1 -Corr*,</p><p>if the interaction study with the strong inhibitor results in a marked effect on the exposure of the investigational drug, potentially leading to dose adjustments, an additional study with a moderate inhibitor of the enzyme is recommended in order to support the evaluation of the need for specific treatment recommendations for other inhibitors of the enzyme. In this context, the applicant was asked to discuss the necessity to include the moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors in the recommendations in section 4.2. The CHMP agrees with the applicant's answer that the interaction study with the strongest CYP2D6 inhibitor bupropion does not result in a marked effect on the exposure of the investigational drug: AUC0-24h was 2.3-fold higher and Cmax was 2.1-fold higher following co-administration with bupropion. To be noted, according to the Guideline on the Investigation of Drug Interactions, CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 Corr*, June 2012, Appendix VIII, a strong inhibitor causes a &gt; 5 fold increase in the plasma AUC values or ≥ 80% decrease in oral clearance, a moderate inhibitor causes a &gt; 2 fold increase in the plasma AUC or 50-≤80% inhibition of oral clearance, a mild inhibitor causes 1.25 to 2 fold increase in the plasma AUC or ≤ 50% inhibition of oral clearance. For information, the US FDA recommends dosage adjustments if there is a ≥ 2-fold increase in AUC.</p><p>The applicant mentioned adequately in the SmPC section 4.2 that depending on individual patient response, a lower dose of Brintellix may be considered if strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. bupropion, quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine) are added to Brintellix treatment.</p><p>Rifampicin induces CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP2C9, which results in the formation of metabolites other than Lu AA39835 and Lu AA34443 and in a reduction of the Vortioxetine concentration. Lu AA39835</p><p>and Lu AA34443 are mainly formed by CYP2D6, which is a non-inducible enzyme. The decreasing exposure to these metabolites is caused by the reduced amount of Vortioxetine available for metabolism to Lu AA39835 and Lu AA34443.</p><p>An increase in Lu AA39835 concentration following fluconazole inhibition (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4) is expected, since CYP2C9 only plays a minor role in the formation of Lu AA39835 and since the Vortioxetine concentration increases 30 to 40% due to inhibition of other metabolic pathways dependent on CYP3A4, CYP2C19, or CYP2C9. The higher concentrations of Vortioxetine are then metabolised by the major enzyme catalyzing the formation of Lu AA39835, that is, the uninhibited CYP2D6 enzyme, which results in higher concentrations of Lu AA39835.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of the CYP induction and inhibition studies are expected and the metabolism of Vortioxetine is considered to be well understood. The combined treatment with antidepressant and antiepileptic drugs is frequently reported in both neurologic and psychiatric practice. Antiepileptics like carbamazepine and phenytoin are also inducers.</p><p>Drug inducers such as carbamazepine may theoretically increase vortioxetine clearance, being metabolized by CYP3A4. Phenytoin being CYP2C9 inducer, it can also theoretically increase vortioxetine clearance, being partly metabolized by CYP2C9.</p><p>Even if not anticipated by the applicant, a DDI could not be excluded with these other antiepileptic inducers. Therefore, as required by the RAP, the applicant proposes adequately to add carbamazepine and phenytoin in section 4.5 and in section 4.2.</p><p>Co-administration of vortioxetine with multiple doses of a CYP3A4/5 and P-gp inhibitor (ketoconazole) or a CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4/5 inhibitor (fluconazole) led to increases of 30% and 46% for AUC0-t and 26% and 15% for Cmax of vortioxetine, respectively. Ketoconazole and fluconazole, two antifungal agents, are potent inhibitors of CYP3A and CYP2C9/C19 enzyme subtypes, respectively.</p><p>Administration of ketoconazole results in significant interaction with drugs metabolized by CYP3A and is generally recommended as an inhibitory probe for that enzyme. Its investigation is therefore fully endorsed. In the same way, fluconazole is an adequate inhibitory probe for CYP2C9. The applicant mentions correctly in section 4.5. of the SmPC that when vortioxetine was co-administered following 6 days of ketoconazole 400 mg/day, a 1.3-fold increase in vortioxetine AUC was observed and that no dose adjustment is needed. The same statement is added for the co-administration of fluconazole 200mg/day with a 1.5-fold increase in AUC.</p><p>CYP2C19 is involved in the metabolism of several important groups of drugs including many proton pump inhibitors. The DDI study with omeprazole (CYP2C19 inhibitor and substrate) indicates adequately that its co-administration with vortioxetine does not affect the PK of vortioxetine.</p><p>No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed following co-administration of aspirin and vortioxetine.</p><p>Co-administration of a single dose of ethanol had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of Vortioxetine.</p><p>In vivo results demonstrating an absence of interaction should only be mentioned in section 4.5 if this is of major importance to the prescriber. As required by RAP, the absence of effect of omeprazole (CYP2C19 inhibitor), aspirin and ethanol on the pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine has been added in section 4.5 (Potential for other medicinal products to affect vortioxetine).</p></div>

The identification of transporters is also not relevant for Lu AA34443 for which the contribution to the in vivo pharmacological effect is non-existent.</p><p>Since the conjugation reactions only involve the Vortioxetine metabolites, which are pharmacologically inactive, and not Vortioxetine itself, inhibition of UGT will have no effect on Vortioxetine exposure.</p><p>Therefore, an investigation of a potential UGT-based interaction will have no clinical relevance.</p><p>Some antipsychotics/neuroleptics, particularly phenothiazines, may competitively inhibit the CYP2D6mediated metabolism of vortioxetine, potentially raising its plasma concentrations. The potential for PK interactions with relevant antipsychotic drugs was asked to be discussed from a mechanistic perspective and the need not to conduct formal studies justified. The applciant's answer is endorsed: in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers, the Vortioxetine exposure was moderately (2-fold) increased following inhibition by the strong CYP2D6 inhibitor bupropion (Study 117). The Vortioxetine exposure seen following co-administration with bupropion was similar to that observed in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers.</p><p>Thus, administration of any CYP2D6 inhibitor can maximally result in a 2-fold increase in Vortioxetine exposure. Therefore, the Applicant does not consider it relevant to conduct formal studies with antipsychotic/neuroleptics that may inhibit the CYP2D6-mediated metabolism of Vortioxetine.</p><p>Patients with depression refractory to treatment with a single agent are sometimes tried on combination therapy.

The SmPC, section 4.2, also include the possibility of dose reduction with regards to combination therapy with potent CYP2D6 inhibitors. In addition to bupropion, the applicant has mentioned an exhaustive list of the potent CYP2D6 inhibitors in section 4.2 and 4.5.

They include the MADRS single-item scores, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) total score, which is used to assess anxiety symptoms, the proportions of responders and remitters, and the Clinical Global Impression -Global Improvement (CGI-I) score, which reflects the investigator's global clinical judgement of the outcome of treatment.</p><p>Additional variables were used to evaluate the effect of Vortioxetine on cognitive dysfunction, healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL), and overall functioning. Cognitive dysfunction was evaluated using the neuropsychological tests RAVLT (a verbal learning and memory task), DSST (a task reliant on speed of processing, executive function and attention), and CPFQ (a patient-reported outcome [PRO]) designed to assess clinically relevant cognitive and physical symptoms associated with depression); HRQoL and overall functioning was evaluated using SF-36 domain scores, the Q-LES-Q (SF) total and single-item scores, the EQ-5D score, the HSQ-12 score, and the SDS total and single-item scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Statistical methods</head><p>For each pivotal study, a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) was prepared before the study was unblinded and before the data were analysed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Short-term studies</head><p>All the analyses in adults and the elderly were performed on the full-analysis-set (FAS), which was defined as all randomised patients who took at least one dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP) and who had at least one valid post-baseline measurement of the primary efficacy variable.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to Week 6 or 8 in MADRS or HAM-D24 total score, and the statistical analysis was either a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis using observed cases (OC) or an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) (see table Primary efficacy analysis in short-term studies above).</p><p>The MMRM analysis used OC and all the data from the Treatment Period. The model had a completely unstructured covariance matrix and included terms for site, baseline score-by-visit interaction, and treatment-by-visit interaction. The ANCOVA used the LOCF, with treatment and site as fixed factors and the baseline scale score as a covariate. The data for the patients treated with the active reference were kept in the models to improve the precision of the estimates.</p><p>In each study, a hierarchically-ordered testing strategy was defined a priori in the SAP and comprised the primary efficacy endpoint, as well as the key secondary efficacy endpoints (see <ref type="table">Table below</ref> Testing Strategies in short-term studies). The testing strategy comprised either one sequence or two sequences tested in parallel. The testing stopped within a sequence as soon as a hypothesis in the hierarchy could not be rejected.</p><p>Hierarchical testing was used to control the 2-sided Type I error over the primary and key secondary endpoints. When the testing strategy comprised one sequence (Studies 11492A,305, 304, and 12541A), each step in the sequence was tested separately versus placebo at a significance level of 0.05; when the testing strategy comprised two parallel sequences (Studies 11984A, 13267A, 315, and 316), each step in each sequence was tested separately versus placebo at a Bonferroni-corrected significance level of 0.025. In Study 303, the testing strategy comprised two steps: the first step comprised one sequence, with a single endpoint that was tested versus placebo at a significance level of 0.05; the second step comprised two parallel sequences, and each step in each sequence was tested separately versus placebo at a Bonferroni-corrected significance level of 0.025.</p><p>In the studies that included an active reference, comparisons of the active reference versus placebo were performed outside the testing strategy, at a significance level of 0.05.</p><p>For endpoints outside the testing strategy, or endpoints within the testing strategy that were not tested because the procedure had stopped, nominal p-values are reported. For individual short-term studies, the phrase "separation from placebo" is used to describe findings with a nominal p-value &lt;0.05. For simplicity, in the tabulations of the secondary efficacy results, the p-values are designated as nominal, regardless of the results in the testing strategy.</p><p>The endpoints (except for response and remission) in the testing strategy were all analysed using the same methodology as that used for the primary efficacy analysis. The results for response and remission were based on logistic regression (LREG), LOCF, adjusting for the baseline score and treatment, with p-values derived from odds ratios. For the CGI-I, the baseline CGI-S score was used as a covariate. In addition, Fisher's exact test and χ2-tests were performed. Sustained response was analysed in the same way. Time to event (that is, time to response, remission, or sustained response) was analysed using both a log-rank test and the Cox proportional hazards model.</p><p>Endpoints outside the testing strategy were analysed using the same methods as for endpoints within the testing strategy. As sensitivity analysis, ANCOVA (LOCF) and MMRM were performed, applying the method that had not been used for primary analysis (i.e. ANCOVA (LOCF) primary analysis -&gt; MMRM sensitivity analysis, and vice versa). Furthermore, post-hoc sensitivity analyses were performed to further confirm the robustness of the results; these included a placebo-mean imputation (PMI) analysis of the change from baseline in MADRS total score and LREG, observed cases (OC) and non-response-imputation (NRI)</p></div>

To provide consistent input for the meta-analyses, a similar analysis approach was applied to all the studies. The MMRM was chosen as the main analysis, however, analyses based on ANCOVA, LOCF were also performed. The PMI results were also used as input for meta-analyses.</p><p>Since not all doses of Vortioxetine were included in all the studies, the meta-analysis approach (rather than a pooled analysis of individual patient data) was considered the statistical methodology that would provide the most reliable estimates of overall treatment effect.

Meta-analyses were also performed for the subset of studies conducted outside the United States.

To evaluate the effect in patients with significant symptoms, a baseline CPFQ total score &gt;25 was used as a cut-off in the analyses. The CPFQ data were analysed using an ANCOVA, LOCF supplemented with an ANCOVA, OC. A path analysis was performed for the cognitive assessment tools (DSST, RAVLT, and CPFQ) to assess the direct and indirect effects of Vortioxetine on cognitive dysfunction.</p><p>To evaluate the clinical relevance of the HRQoL data, in line with the EMA Reflection Paper, the standardised effect size was calculated, and the standard 0.2 threshold was used to interpret the clinical relevance of the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relapse-prevention study</head><p>The efficacy analysis was performed on the FAS, defined as all randomised patients who took at least one dose of IMP in the Double-blind Period. The primary analysis of time to relapse considered data up to Week 24 in the double-blind period. The treatment groups were compared using a Cox model with an exact method to handle ties; this analysis was supplemented by Kaplan-Meier plots. Withdrawals that occurred before Week 24 in the Double-blind Period due to reasons other than lack of efficacy (relapse) were censored at dropout time, i.e. considered non-relapses.</p><p>A secondary analysis of time to relapse considered all data in the double-blind period.</p><p>As a sensitivity analyses, the Cox analysis was repeated excluding all relapses that occurred within 1,2, and 4 weeks after randomization, in order to separate the possible effects of rebound and discontinuation symptoms from relapses in the placebo group. Another analysis excluded all relapses that occurred &gt;5 days after the date of last dose of double-blind study medication. Sensitivity analyses using a standard log-rank test and accelerated failure time models, taking the interval-censored nature of the data into account, were also performed. Various distributions were studied in these models including Weibull and log-normal.</p><p>The secondary variables were evaluated using descriptive statistics, ANCOVA, using both the OC and LOCF, and χ² tests for response and remission.</p><p>Time to event analyses including log-rank tests and Kaplan-Meier estimates were provided to compare treatment arms with respect to all reasons leading to withdrawal, adverse events leading to withdrawal, and lack of efficacy leading to withdrawal.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of main study(ies)</head><p>The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections). The comparisons of 10 mg were considered primary. The efficacy endpoints were tested in a pre-defined sequential order at significance level 0.05; as soon as an endpoint was non-significant at 0.05, the testing procedure stopped for all subsequent endpoints. The Vortioxetine 10 mg group was statistically significantly different from placebo. Since the formal testing was stopped at the second variable in the pre-specified order, none of the subsequent endpoints in the testing hierarchy were considered statistically significantly different from placebo. This includes the change from Baseline in HAM-D24 total score after 8 weeks of treatment for the 5 mg. To control the two-sided type I error over all the efficacy endpoints that are intended to support potential claims among the two Vortioxetine doses 10 mg and 20 mg, the efficacy endpoints were tested for each dose in a predefined sequential order at significance level 0.025. Vortioxetine 20 mg was statistically significantly better than placebo in mean change from Baseline in MADRS total score at Week 8. The parallel sequence testing strategy stopped for the 20-mg dose at the MADRS responders step which was not significantly different from placebo. Vortioxetine 10 mg was not significantly different from placebo at Week. Notes ANCOVA adjusting for centre and baseline HAM-D24, LOCF imputation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis description Secondary analysis</head><p>To control the type I error over all the efficacy endpoints that were intended to support potential claims, the efficacy endpoints were tested in a predefined sequential order at significance level 0.05.    The mean values per visit during the Double-blind Period are quite different, depending on whether OC or the LOCF is used. This difference occurs since a considerably larger proportion of patients in the placebo group withdrew from the study. The mean treatment differences to placebo in the Doubleblind Period were generally larger for the VOR group in the LOCF analyses than in the OC analyses, however, primarily OC data are presented in the body of this report as they best reflect the patients who responded to treatment. </p></div>

Inclusion of the additional studies results in overall lower HAM-A effect sizes for all doses, as indicated by the bold values:</p><p>-1.21 points (p =0.019), -1.69 points (p =0.003), and -1.73 points (p =0.020) for the 5, 10, and 20 mg/day doses, respectively; the 15mg/day dose did not separate from placebo in the meta-analysis with an effect size of -0.88 points (p=0.291).</p><p>Of note, in the four short-term GAD studies including doses of 2.5 to 10 mg (studies 308, 309, 310, 311) vortioxetine (5 mg) separated from placebo only in 1 of the 4 studies (European study 311) in the primary endpoint mean change from baseline in HAM-A total score after 8 weeks of treatment.</p><p>In meta-analyses of the initially submitted short term studies of the mean CGI-I score at Week 6/8, the overall mean difference to placebo across the studies was statistically significant: -0.3 points (p =0.001), -0.5 points (p &lt;0.001), and -0.5 points (p = 0.047) for the 5, 10, and 20mg/day doses, respectively; the 15mg/day dose did not separate from placebo in the meta-analysis (the difference to placebo was -0.4 points). The CGI-I scores of the active comparator, venlafaxine or duloxetine, were in general numerically superior to those of vortioxetine. The meta-analysis restricted to the four non-US studies (11492A, 11984A, 305, 13267A) showed that all doses were clinically relevant as to the CGI-I score.</p><p>The results of the updated meta-analyses including studies 317, 14122 A, and CCT-002 did not change the overall dose-response pattern. However, the clinical relevance of the effect size was improved (Panel 45). The results are summarised below. The overall mean difference to placebo across the studies was statistically significant: -0.3 points (p &lt;0.001), -0.4 points (p &lt;0.001), and -0.5 points (p = 0.002) for the 5, 10, and 20mg/day doses, respectively; the 15mg/day dose did not separate from placebo in the meta-analysis (the difference to placebo was -0.29 points). Therefore the overall effect on the CGI-score was modest. When the metaanalysis (MMRM) of the mean CGI-I score at Week 6/8 was repeated for the short-term, placebocontrolled studies in adults conducted outside the United States, the results were similar but more pronounced; the overall mean difference to placebo across the studies was statistically significant: -0.4 points (p &lt;0.001), -0.5 points (p &lt;0.001), -0.7 points (p &lt;0.001), and -0.7 points (p = 0.002) for the 5, 10, 15, and 20mg/day doses, respectively.</p><p>The meta-analyses on the SDS total score, which provides a patient-rated assessment of impaired functioning in the areas of work, social life, and family life, showed clinical improvement for the 10 and 20 mg doses but not for the 5 mg and 15 mg dose. The 5 mg dose was also not clinically relevant in the meta-analysis restricted to the four non-US studies. (Panel 93).</p><p>In the meta-analysis including studies 317 and CCT-002, the overall mean difference to placebo across the studies was statistically significant: -1.7 points (p &lt;0.001) for the 10mg/day dose and -1.9 points (p = 0.006) for the 20mg/day dose; the 5 and 15mg/day doses were not statistically significantly different from placebo. No consistent dose-effect could be shown.</p><p>The applicant presented an extensive analysis regarding HRQoL and overall functioning. Although it is agreed that all HRQoL and overall functioning instruments used in the clinical development programme are validated assessment tools with sufficient reliability their homogeneous use through all dosages has not been shown. The only scale that was used in most (9) of the short term-studies was the SDS scale. Results separated nominally from placebo (p&lt;0.05) in four of the studies (studies 11984A for the 10 mg dose only, study 13267A for 15 and 20 mg, study 316 for 20 mg dose only, and study CCT-002 for 10 mg only but not for 5 and 20 mg) but not for all dosages in all domains; furthermore, as SDS endpoint in these studies was lower in the hierarchy of the testing strategies than endpoints which did not separate from placebo, superiority over placebo was not statistically significant according to the strategy for multiple testing. Analyses of clinical relevance were conducted post-hoc and were not predefined as requested in the "Reflection paper on the regulatory guidance for the use of health-related quality of life (HRQL) measures in the evaluation of medicinal products" (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/ 139391/ 2004). Neither a strategy to control for multiplicity nor the effect size that can be considered as clinically relevant were pre-specified.</p><p>The Applicant agreed that the drug effect of Vortioxetine on HRQoL is expected to be mediated through an improvement in depressive symptoms. In this regard HRQoL assessments provide insight in the interpretation of the observed effect on the primary endpoint in terms of consequences for the patient.</p></div>

Overall, the results indicate that, although there were variations across the studies, the effect of Vortioxetine increased with increasing dose. In the dedicated study in the elderly (study 12541A) the difference of Vortioxetine 5mg/ day versus placebo was -0.4 points (p&lt;0.05).</p><p>For HAM-A item 5 the overall mean difference to placebo across the studies was statistically significant:</p><p>-0.1 points (p = 0.006), -0.2 points (p = 0.001), -0.35 points (p = 0.002), and -0.4 points (p &lt;0.001) for the 5, 10, 15, and 20mg/day doses, respectively. Overall, the results indicate that, although there were variations across the studies, the effect of Vortioxetine increased with increasing dose. In the dedicated study in the elderly (study 12541A) the difference of Vortioxetine 5mg/ day versus placebo was -0.25 points (p&lt;0.05).</p><p>This meta-analysis according to the applicant supports the favourable effects of vortioxetine on cognitive dysfunction and is seen complementary to the results of the two neuropsychological tests RAVLT and DSST in study 12541A and the CPFQ Scores in study 316.</p><p>However, analyses were not pre-specified and may have been data-driven. A convincing independent effect on cognition through all studies has not been shown and the results of the meta-analysis are seen rather as an effect on the broad range of depressive symptoms than a specific effect on cognition since only some aspect of cognition are captured by these subscales. Pooled analyses (based on the MADRS total score) were only performed on small subpopulations for which there were too few patients in the individual studies for analysis.</p><p>Since submission of the MAA, additional nonclinical data have been generated that strengthen that Vortioxetine has the potential to enhance cognitive function. However, convincing clinical data to support this assumption are still lacking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pooled efficacy analysis in the elderly</head><p>A pooled efficacy analysis based on the short-term studies in adults was provided of elderly patients (aged ≥65 years). In these studies about 13% of the patients were aged ≥65 years. In the pooled analysis of patients aged ≥65 years from the short-term studies in adults, the effect sizes at Week 8 were -4.0 (p 0.07), -5.5 (p 0.04), 0.01 (p 0.99), and -3.2 (p 0.23) points on the MADRS total score for 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/day, respectively. The data thus indicate that vortioxetine is effective in the dose range of 5 and 10 mg/day. Overall, in patients aged ≥65 years, the 15 mg dose had no effect whereas the effect of the 20 mg dose was not statistically different from placebo. However, the number of patients with the higher doses (15/20mg) is too small to draw clear conclusions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.3.">Discussion on clinical efficacy Design and conduct of clinical studies</head><p>The application is based on a development program of 9 short-term studies including a dedicated study in the elderly and 1 long-term placebo-controlled relapse-prevention study.</p><p>The nine short-term studies were randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, fixed- Demographic characteristics across the studies in adults were similar, with approximately twice as many women as men and a mean age of 44 years (mean range: 42 to 47 years across studies).</p><p>Differences in the racial distribution across the studies were observed, reflecting the fact that the studies were conducted in different geographical regions. The majority (overall, 81%) of the patients were Caucasian; the remaining patients were mainly Asians (mean: 6%; range: 7% to 21% across the studies that included Asians) or Blacks (mean: 12%; range: 21% to 28% across the studies that included Blacks).</p><p>The mean BMI differed somewhat between the studies conducted in the United States (approximately 31kg/m2) and those conducted outside the United States (approximately 26kg/m2). In the dedicated study in the elderly, the mean age of the patients was 71 years and the majority (&gt;90%) of the patients were Caucasians. Otherwise, the baseline patient characteristics of this population were similar to that of the adult population.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint(s) in the short-term studies (including the dedicated study in the elderly) were either the MADRS or Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) 24. Both assessment tools are well established scales for assessing a change in depressive symptom severity and the use is in accordance with the guideline. In the long-term relapse-prevention study, the primary efficacy endpoint was the time to relapse of MDD within the first 24 weeks of the Double-blind Period.</p><p>The inter-rater reliability scores (kappa) were provided showing the raters were trained in using the efficacy rating scale used to assess the primary variable. The inter-rater variability was determined to be fair.</p><p>The efficacy of Vortioxetine was further assessed based on the MADRS single-item scores, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) total score, the proportions of responders and remitters, and the Clinical Global Impression -Global Improvement (CGI-I) score, which reflects the investigator's global clinical judgement of the outcome of treatment.</p><p>A ≥50% decrease from baseline in MADRS or HAM-D24 total score was defined in the protocols as a response criterion and a MADRS or HAM-D24 total score ≤10 was defined as a remission criterion which is in line with literature data. However, in the elderly study (12541A), response was defined as a ≥50% decrease from baseline in HAM-D24, MADRS, or HAM-D17 total score or a CGI-I score ≤2 and remission was defined as a MADRS total score ≤10, or a HAM-D17 total score ≤7, or a CGI-S score ≤2.</p><p>In addition, the effect of Vortioxetine was assessed in patients with severe MDD (baseline MADRS total score ≥30) or a high level of anxiety (defined as a baseline HAM-A total score ≥20), as these patients are difficult to treat and the treatment outcome is typically poorer. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specific</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy data and additional analyses</head><p>The first study (11492A) compared the efficacy of vortioxetine 5 mg and 10 mg vs. placebo with venlafaxine 225 mg as active comparator to check assay sensitivity. The primary efficacy analyses showed that both doses of vortioxetine were statistically superior to placebo in mean change from baseline in MADRS total score at Week 6, with a mean treatment difference to placebo of 5.9 (5 mg) and 5.7 points (10 mg). Venlafaxine was also statistically significantly superior to placebo at Week 6, Brintellix with a mean treatment difference to placebo of 6.4 points. Response and remission rates were about 22-percentage points% higher in the vortioxetine group compared to the placebo group. The rates were 28 percentage points higher in the venlafaxine group compared to placebo. Patients on 10 mg vortioxetine treatment improved somewhat better on the patient-rated quality of life scale, SF-36, than those on the 5 mg dose. The improvement of the patients' HRQoL was more pronounced in the venlafaxine group.</p><p>The second study (11984A) compared the efficacy of vortioxetine 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg vs.</p><p>placebo with duloxetine 60 mg as active comparator. In the primary efficacy analysis, there was no statistically significant difference between vortioxetine 5 or 10 mg/day and placebo in the change from baseline in MADRS total score at Week 8. Hence, the pre-defined, sequential testing procedure was stopped at the first step. Also, there was no statistically significant difference between duloxetine 60mg/day and placebo in the primary efficacy analysis. Hence, this study is considered failed. In addition, vortioxetine 2.5 mg/day did not separate from placebo. The lack of efficacy of vortioxetine and duloxetine was believed mainly to be due to the early timing of withdrawals, resulting in missing data which affected the LOCF analysis. An MMRM analysis which is more robust towards missing data showed a separation from placebo in favour of vortioxetine 5 mg and 10 mg (p &lt;0.05) and duloxetine (p &lt;0.01) at Week 8, but not for vortioxetine 2.5 mg. The mean treatment differences to placebo were of about 2.5 points for vortioxetine (2.5 and 2.6 points for 5 and 10mg /day respectively) and 3 points for duloxetine.</p><p>The third study (305) compared the efficacy of vortioxetine 1 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg vs. placebo. Since the 1 mg dose was expected to be not efficacious, it was not included in the pre-specified statistical testing procedure. The vortioxetine 10 mg group was statistically different for the primary endpoint, i.e. change from Baseline in HAM-D24 total score at Week 8. However, the 10 mg dose was not statistically significantly different from placebo in the second variable in the testing hierarchy, i.e. change from Baseline in the SDS total score at Week 8, which is a patient-rated quality of life scale.</p><p>Since the formal statistical testing was stopped at the second variable in the pre-specified order, none of the subsequent endpoints in the pre-specified testing hierarchy were considered statistically different from placebo. This includes the change from Baseline in HAM-D24 total score after 8 weeks of treatment for the 1 mg and the 5 mg dose even though nominal P&lt;0.001 (MMRM). However, with the effect size shown and the nominal P-value &lt;0.05 in the comparison of vortioxetine 5 mg versus placebo, it indicated clinical relevance of the 5 mg dose. Thus, only the outcome of the 10 mg dose versus placebo was statistically significant for the LS mean change from Baseline in HAM-D24 total score at Week 8 (primary endpoint, the first parameter in the pre-specified testing order that was statistically significant). However, the outcome of the 1 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg doses were clinically significant for the primary endpoint and several secondary endpoints including change from Baseline in MADRS total score at Week 8 (P&lt;0.001), HAM-D24 response rate at Week 8 (P&lt;0.001), and MADRS remission rate.</p><p>However, the vortioxetine treatments could not be distinguished from placebo, in the area of quality of life improvement, as self-rated by the patients.</p><p>The fourth study (13267A) compared the efficacy of vortioxetine 15 mg and 20 mg vs. placebo with duloxetine 60 mg as active comparator. Effect sizes were generally high in this study.The primary efficacy analyses showed that both doses of vortioxetine were statistically superior to placebo in mean change from baseline in MADRS total score at Week 8, with a mean treatment difference to placebo of 5.5 (15 mg) and 7.1 points (20 mg). Duloxetine was also statistically significantly superior to placebo at Week 8, with a mean treatment difference to placebo of 9.5 points. The odds ratios for response and remission were about 3 and 2.5, resp., in the vortioxetine group compared to the placebo group. The Brintellix active comparator showed odds ratios of 6 and 5, for response and remission, resp. Patients on 20 mg vortioxetine treatment improved somewhat better on the primary and secondary endpoints, including the patient-rated quality of life scale, SF-36, than those on the 15 mg dose. The improvement was again more pronounced in the duloxetine group. Thus, although a direct comparison between vortioxetine and duloxetine was not the objective of this study, the data show a greater numerical effect size with duloxetine than with vortioxetine</p><p>The fifth study (315) was performed in the US only and compared the efficacy of vortioxetine 15 mg and 20 mg vs. placebo with duloxetine 60 mg as active comparator. The primary efficacy analyses showed that only the 20 mg dose of vortioxetine was statistically superior to placebo in mean change from baseline in MADRS total score at Week 8, with a mean treatment difference to placebo of 2.75 (P=0.023). The 15 mg dose showed a minor improvement of 1.5 points over placebo in MADRS total scores, which was neither statistically nor clinically significant. Duloxetine was statistically significantly superior to placebo at Week 8, with a mean treatment difference to placebo of 4 points, which was less than half the value obtained in the previous study (13267A). The odds ratios for response and remission were about 1.3 and 1, resp., in the vortioxetine group compared to the placebo group.</p><p>Duloxetine performed better with an odds ratio of 2 for response rate. The odds ratio for remission rates of duloxetine, however, was about 1 and hence not superior over vortioxetine or over placebo.</p><p>None of the key secondary efficacy endpoints separated from placebo (nominal p&lt;0.050) with either vortioxetine dose. The odds ratios for response indicate that response was twice as likely in the placebo group than in the vortioxetine treatment groups. The proportions of subjects in remission as defined by MADRS total score or CGI-S were generally similar across treatment groups. In the patientrated SDS total score, the 15 mg dose was about equal to placebo with a mean difference of 0.05 points (P = 1). The 20 mg dose showed a 0.9 point improvement compared with placebo (P = 0.4).</p><p>The sixth study (316) was performed in the US only and compared the efficacy of vortioxetine 10 mg and 20 mg vs. placebo. The primary efficacy analyses showed that only the 20 mg dose of vortioxetine was statistically superior to placebo with a treatment difference of 3.64 points in mean change from baseline in MADRS total score at Week 8 (P=0.002). The 10 mg dose showed slight improvements in primary (2.19 points in mean change from baseline in MADRS total score) and secondary endpoints, including response and remission rate and the patient-rated SDS total score, but these did not reach statistical significance (P&gt;0.05). The 20 mg dose also showed slight improvements in the secondary endpoints response and remission rate and SDS total score, with varying statistical significance (0.025&lt;P&lt;0.059).</p><p>The seventh study (303) was performed in the US only and compared the efficacy of vortioxetine 5 mg vs. placebo. The primary efficacy analyses showed that the 5 mg dose of vortioxetine was statistically not superior to placebo in mean change from baseline in HAM-D24 total score at Week 6. Values for the secondary efficacy variables from the sequential testing as well as the other secondary efficacy variables for 5 mg vortioxetine were similar to placebo.</p><p>The eighth study (304) was performed in the US only and compared the efficacy of vortioxetine 2.5 mg and 5 mg vs. placebo with duloxetine 60 mg as active comparator. The primary efficacy analyses showed that the 2.5 mg and 5 mg dose of vortioxetine did not separate from placebo in any of the primary or secondary efficacy endpoints, and did not provide evidence of a clinical benefit. However, duloxetine separated from placebo on the primary and all key secondary endpoints (P &lt;0.05).</p><p>Additional pivotal studies completed between MAA submission and 31 August 2013: (defined as inadequate response to two prior courses of at least 6 weeks of conventional antidepressant drugs in adequate dosages) were excluded from this trial. The rationale for choosing agomelatine as the active comparator was that it has a mechanism of action that is different from that of SSRIs/SNRIs, in that it is a norepinephrine dopamine inhibitor (NDDI), whereas Vortioxetine might represents a new pharmacological class of antidepressants, which might have a different mechanism of action, in that it could be a multimodal antidepressant. A total of 501 patients were randomized equally</p><p>(1:1) to flexible doses of either Vortioxetine (VOR) 10 or 20mg/day or agomelatine 25 or 50mg/day for 12 weeks of double-blind treatment. The applied statistical methods were the same as utilized in the previous studies, which is considered appropriate (primary endpoint difference from baseline in MADRS total score at Week 8 was evaluated using a MMRM approach).</p><p>The CHMP did not agree with the definition of the patient population "patients with MDD who have responded inadequately to SRI antidepressant monotherapy", for the following reasons:</p><p>Inadequate response to previous SRI monotherapy is assumed based on the mean MADTRS total score at baseline/randomisation whereas documented evidence of the severity of depression at the onset of the first SRI monotherapy are not available and data on response and patient compliance to this SRI monotherapy were collected retrospectively.It cannot be excluded that fully responsive patients to the first SRI monotherapy could have been included in the study since the severity of depression was not assessed at the onset of the first monotherapyduring the lead-in period. However, the patients still had a mean MADRS total score at study entry of 29 points (ranging from 22 to 43 points) indicating moderate to severe depression. In the absence of data for the lead-in period, it cannot be established whether the study population was indeed limited to non responders or also included partial responders.</p><p>Lack of patient compliance to the first SRI monotherapy could have lead to inadequate response to the SRI monotherapy. However, patients were not followed during the SRI monotherapy and their compliance was therefore not assessed prospectivelybut only retrospectively by patient reporting via clinical interview. Patients' decision to change treatment and participate in the clinical trial could have been motivated by reasons other than dissatisfaction with the first SRI monotherapy.</p><p>Considering the half-lives of the SSRIs/SNRIs allowed in the lead-in period (fluoxetine was excluded) the risk of a carry-over effect of the first SRI monotherapy is considered to be minimal at the assessement of the efficacy endpoint at week 8.</p><p>The MMRM estimates for the mean change from baseline in MADRS total score at Week 8 were -16.5</p><p>and -14.4 points in the vortioxetine group and the agomelatine group, respectively, giving a mean difference of -2.16 points in favour of vortioxetine (95% CI: -3.5 to -0.81;p = 0.002). Non-inferiority was established, as the upper bound of the 95% CI for the vortioxetine and agomelatine comparison was -0.81 MADRS points, and therefore clearly below the non-inferiority margin of +2 MADRS points versus agomelatine. As the two-sided 95% CI for the difference between the means excluded zero and was in favour of vortioxetine, vortioxetine was even superior to agomelatine (which also shows that Brintellix the trial had assay sensitivity). The positive results were confirmed by the sensitivity analyses (PPS, MMRM; ANCOVA, FAS, LOCF) and the secondary efficacy endpoints. Vortioxetine was consistently statistically significantly better than agomelatine based on analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints (MADRS total score, HAM-A total score, CGI-S score, CGI-I score) and health-related quality of life and overall functioning scores [SDS total score, EQ-5D Summary Index, WLQ Global Productivity Index, and DFFS total score]) at Weeks <ref type="formula">8</ref>  Vortioxetine 10 and 20mg/day were statistically significantly superior to placebo in the composite zscore (p &lt;0.001), as well as in the next pre-specified key secondary efficacy analysis of the DSST (p &lt;0.001) but not in the RAVLT (learning) score. The mean difference in z-score versus placebo was 0.36 and 0.33 for vortioxetine 10 and 20 mg respectively. However, the clinical relevant effect size of this composite score is not known and was therefore not pre-defined. The cognitive performance of the patients in the four key domains was assessed using additional neuropsychological tests, namely, TMT A (speed of processing) and B (executive function), SRT (speed of processing), CRT (attention), and STROOP (executive function). The results of the secondary analyses based on these tests supported the results of the primary analysis, that is, the patients who received vortioxetine 10 or 20mg/day improved statistically significantly more than those who received placebo on all the assessed measures, with the exception of CRT in the vortioxetine 20mg group. Vortioxetine 10 and 20mg/day demonstrated a consistent positive effect on depressive symptoms, as assessed using the MADRS: the difference to placebo in total score (FAS, MMRM) at Week 8 was -4.7 points for vortioxetine 10mg/day and -6.7 points for vortioxetine 20mg/day. The clinical relevance of this treatment effect was supported by the effect seen on the clinical global impression (CGI-S and CGI-I). Furthermore, statistically significant proportions of patients responded (defined as a ≥50% reduction from baseline in MADRS total score) or remitted (defined as a MADRS total score ≤10): 48 and 59% of the patients in the vortioxetine 10 and 20mg groups, respectively, were responders and 30 and 38% of the patients in the vortioxetine 10 and 20mg groups, respectively, were remitters at Week 8. The difference to placebo in the proportion of responders was &gt;16 percentage points. No active comparator was included in this study, which would have been important to show that the cognitive improvement could not only be explained by the antidepressive effect. To evaluate whether the direct treatment effect on cognitive function was independent on depressive symptoms, the primary and key secondary analyses were repeated as post-hoc analyses in patients who had not responded (non-responders, that is, Brintellix patients who had a &lt;50% reduction from baseline to Week 8 in MADRS total score) and in patients who had not remitted (non-remitters, that is, patients who had a MADRS total score &gt;10 at Week 8).</p><p>Vortioxetine 10 and 20mg/day were statistically significantly superior to placebo in the composite zscore (p &lt;0.001). However, if a composite endpoint is used, an interpretation of the resulting scale should be provided in terms of the size of a clinically relevant benefit (please refer to ICH E9, Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials, CPMP/ICH/363/96) but the applicant did not provide such an interpretation. As clinical interpretation of the primary endpoint is not possible, the evaluation of clinical relevance has to be based on the single components of the primary endpoint, which were key secondary endpoints. The Applicant argues that the clinical relevance of the cognitive effects was supported by the magnitude of the standardized effect sizes, the pre-specified path analysis and the statistical significant effect on cognitive performance in patients who were defined as non-responders or non-remitters. However, it appears questionable that clinical relevance of the effects can be robustly </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical studies in special populations</head><p>The ninth study in the initial submission package (12541A) compared the efficacy of vortioxetine 5 mg vs. placebo with duloxetine 60 mg as active comparator in 453 patients aged ≥65 years. A total of 156 patients received vortioxetine 5 mg.</p><p>Subgroup analyses in the previous studies showed a decreased vortioxetine efficacy in patients aged ≥55 years, which is in line with the general observation of reduced antidepressant efficacy in older patients. Hence, the choice of a lower than recommended 10 mg dose is surprising, but was justified by the Applicant for safety reasons. In view of the lower efficacy observed in patients above the age of 55, the positive treatment effect of the 5 mg dose in elderly could not necessarily be expected.</p><p>Overall, the mean age (± SD) at baseline was 71 ± 5 years, the ratio of men to women was approximately 1:2, and the vast majority (93% to 96%) of the patients were Caucasian. The study was conducted both inside and outside the United States. In the primary efficacy analysis, vortioxetine Study 12541 A had two special aspects that are highlighted subsequently. It was the only study among the 9 short-term studies that was a) conducted both in and outside the United States and b) it was the only study that included neuropsychological tests as cognition endpoints.</p><p>Taking into account the results of the 4 other US studies, two of which were negative (studies 303 and 304) and two of which showed efficacy only in the highest dose group of 20 mg (studies 315 and 316)</p><p>it was of special interest to repeat primary and secondary efficacy analyses in this study separately for sites in and outside the US. The antidepressant-placebo differences in the mean changes from baseline in the MADRS and HAM-D24 (primary variable) total scores were approximately 2 points higher for the non-US than the US sites, both for Vortioxetine and duloxetine in the MMRM and ANCOVA, LOCF analyses.</p><p>For the non-US sites, Vortioxetine 5mg/day separated from placebo on all the efficacy variables (MADRS total score, HAM-D24 total score, HAM-A total score, CGI-S score, CGI-I score), both in the MMRM and in the ANCOVA, LOCF analyses. For the US sites, Vortioxetine 5mg/day separated from placebo in the MMRM analyses of the mean changes from baseline in the MADRS total score and CGI-S score and of the mean CGI-I score. In contrast no separation was reached for any parameter in the ANCOVA/LOCF analysis.</p><p>This difference between US/non-US studies was further substantiated by pharmacokinetic data from the phase II/III population showing lower and more variable LuAA21004 plasma concentrations in US patients (see PK section) and it may be concluded that US patients were less compliant to study medication.</p><p>Cognitive dysfunction is recognised as an important characteristic during the acute phase of MDD. The neuropsychological tests RAVLT (learning and memory) and DSST (speed of processing, executive function, and attention) were used in the dedicated study in the elderly, as these tests involve several of the cognitive processes that are known to be impaired in patients with MDD. The applicant´s rationale to conduct these evaluations primarily in the elderly was that cognitive dysfunction in MDD is known to be even more pronounced in the elderly than in adults and is therefore considered more sensitive to change. This is acknowledged, however for an assumed independent effect on cognition it would have been expected to show this effect in the overall population and not only in the elderly population. Vortioxetine 5mg/day and the active reference duloxetine separated from placebo (p &lt;0.05) in the RAVLT while only Vortioxetine separated from placebo (p &lt;0.05) in the DSST. This according to the applicant demonstrates the different profile versus duloxetine improving not only learning and memory capacities but also speed, attention and executive functioning and is claimed to be supported by the magnitude of the standardized effect sizes and nonclinical findings.</p><p>In addition, a path analysis was performed to assess to what extent the effect on DSST and RAVLT was a direct treatment effect, rather than an indirect effect through improvement of depressive symptoms, as measured using the primary assessment tool (HAM-D24). The results showed that Vortioxetine 5mg/day had an 83% direct effect on DSST correct numbers (duloxetine 26%), a 71% direct effect on RAVLT acquisition (duloxetine 65%), and a 72% direct effect on RAVLT delayed recall (duloxetine 66%).</p><p>Concerning the path analysis, the additional information and the sensitivity analyses that were provided are somewhat reassuring on the robustness of the results of this analysis. Nevertheless, the path analysis is considered a post-hoc exploratory analysis without independent replication. Compared with duloxetine, a markedly higher direct effect of Vortioxetine was observed only for one of the three parameters of the neuropsychological tests DSST and RAVLT, which does not consistently support the claim of a different profile of Vortioxetine. Furthermore, the validity of the path analysis is somewhat challenged by the path analysis for DSST using total MADRS as a mediator where a negative direct effect on cognitive symptoms was found for duloxetine, which appears contradictory.</p><p>The Applicant furthermore acknowledges that the effect on the clinician-rated cognitive symptoms (single terms of the MADRS and HAM-A) is part of the effect on the broad range of depressive symptoms.</p><p>Overall, a convincing independent effect on cognition remains to be shown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relapse prevention study</head><p>In the relapse-prevention study 11985A the primary efficacy analysis showed a statistically significantly superior effect of vortioxetine relative to placebo on the time to relapse of MDD during the first 24 weeks of the Double-blind Period (FAS; Cox proportional hazard model, p = 0.0035). The proportion of patients who relapsed was lower in the vortioxetine group (13%) than in the placebo group (26%). The Cox proportional hazard model gave a hazard ratio of 2.01, indicating that the risk of relapse was two times higher for placebo-treated patients than for vortioxetine -treated patients.</p><p>Vortioxetine was also statistically significantly superior to placebo in the secondary analysis of time to relapse during the entire Double-blind Period using the FAS. The robustness of the results was confirmed by a number of sensitivity analyses.</p><p>Vortioxetine 5 mg or 10 mg flexible doses were effective in preventing relapse, as demonstrated both by the primary and by the secondary statistical analyses. The primary analysis of the time from randomisation to relapse within the first 24 weeks of the Double-blind Period showed statistically significant superiority over placebo with respect to time to relapse and relapse rates. The risk of relapse was twice as high in the placebo group as in the vortioxetine group.</p><p>The mean MADRS total scores were stable over time and remained close to the Baseline II level in both vortioxetine and placebo groups during the Double-blind Period. The therapeutic effect in MDD was thus maintained and stable over time during long-term double-blind period (up to 64 weeks) in both the placebo and the vortioxetine group.</p><p>Questions were raised regarding the analysis of the time to relapse in the double-blind period of the relapse prevention study (11985A). In the placebo group, mainly withdrawals due to lack of efficacy are expected whereas in the vortioxetine group mainly withdrawals due to adverse events are expected. The study considered adverse events always as primary reason for withdrawal. The</p><p>Applicant clarified that all withdrawals due to lack of efficacy were considered in the analysis, that is, not only those where lack of efficacy was given as the primary reason for withdrawal. Furthermore, if a patient was not withdrawn due to lack of efficacy but had a MADRS total score ≥22, the patient was considered relapsed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supportive studies</head><p>Persistence The mean MADRS total score decreased from 10.7 points at Baseline II to 5.3 points at Week 52, a reduction of approximately 5.4 points, indicating maintained improvement in depressive symptoms during the extension study.</p><p>However, the data are inconclusive due to the lack of a placebo control and low numbers of patients included in each group.</p><p>The second extension study (11984B) evaluated the maintenance of the therapeutic effect of 2.5 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg flexible doses of vortioxetine over a period of 52 weeks in 535 patients with MDD who completed the 8-week short-term Study 11984A. After completing the 8-Week Study 11492A, eligible patients were switched to a 5 mg/day vortioxetine dose. After the first week, the dose was flexible (2.5, 5 or 10mg/day) based on the patient's tolerability to treatment, as judged by the investigator.</p><p>The mean MADRS total score decreased from 13.5 points at Baseline II to 5.5 points at Week 52, and the mean CGI-S score decreased from 2.7 points at Baseline II to 1.7 points at Week 52, indicating maintained improvement in depressive symptoms and the global impression during the extension study.</p><p>The third extension study <ref type="formula">(301)</ref>  Lead-in study 13267A was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, duloxetinereferenced, fixed-dose study evaluating the efficacy and safety of vortioxetine 15 and 20mg/day in the acute treatment of adult patients with MDD. A total of 607 patients were randomized equally (1:1:1:1) to placebo, vortioxetine 15 or 20 mg/day, or duloxetine for 8 weeks of double-blind treatment. The number of patients who completed the lead-in study was lower in the vortioxetine 15 or 20 mg/day treatment groups (77% and 83%, resp.) than for the duloxetine and placebo treatment groups (89% and 84%, resp.). In total, 506 patients completed the lead-in study.</p><p>The inclusion and exclusion criteria were essentially the same as those in the other short-term MDD studies, for subjects who had completed the 10 Week lead-in study.</p><p>The continuation study was originally planned to follow the safety and tolerability of 300 subjects, but only 71 were enrolled. Results obtained from a small population is not statistically significant and could be influenced by selection bias among the subjects who initially enrolled for the lead-in study, and who finally enrolled in the continuation study.</p><p>The primary objective was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of flexible doses of vortioxetine (15 and 20 mg/day) over a period of 52 weeks in patients with MDD who have completed the lead-in Study 13267A. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the therapeutic effect of flexible doses of vortioxetine (15 and 20 mg/day) over a period of 52 weeks in patients with MDD as assessed by Montgomery and Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Clinical Global Impression -Severity of Illness (CGI-S), and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A).</p><p>Due to the open-label design of the study, the efficacy and health-related quality of life and overall functioning measures were considered exploratory and the results are presented using descriptive statistics.</p><p>The assessment of the long-term efficacy was considered as a secondary objective for this study. The results showed an improvement of depressive symptoms irrespective of previous treatment (on average, the MADRS total score decreased 10 points from Baseline II to Week 52). The highest improvement was observed in the group of previously placebo-treated patients while the less important changes were seen in the groups of patients previously treated with vortioxetine (20 mg) and duloxetine. The analysis of other efficacy measures (HAM-A, CGI-S) showed also better improvement for the previously placebo-treated patients.</p><p>The results should be interpreted very cautiously because of the low number of subjects, the potential selection bias, and the open-label nature of the design. The studies are inconclusive as to the maintenance of the clinical effect. The mean MADRS total score at Week 52 was about 5 indicating that on average, remission (MADRS≤10) was achieved in the patient population. However, the minimum and maximum values of the MADRS total score were 0 and 20, resp. This indicates that after one year treatment, some patients were total remitters (MADRS score of 0) whereas others remained depressed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.4.">Conclusions on clinical efficacy</head><p>Twelve double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6/8-week, fixed-dose studies have been conducted to investigate the short-term efficacy of vortioxetine in MDD in adults (including the elderly).</p><p>Three main studies demonstrated efficacy of vortioxetine in adults based on decreasing scores on depression scales such as MADRS and HAM-D. These studies involved the 5 mg and 10 mg dose (11492A, 305) and the 15 mg and 20 mg dose (13267A) and were all performed outside the US.</p><p>In addition, one dedicated study demonstrated efficacy of vortioxetine 5 mg in patients ≥65 years (12541A). This study was performed both in-and outside the US.</p><p>The results of the primary endpoints were confirmed by CGI-I scores and responder and remitter analyses.</p><p>Short-term efficacy (at 6 or 8 weeks) of the recommended 10 mg dose was demonstrated in two of four short-term pivotal trials which were able to discriminate vortioxetine from placebo. Two of these four trials (11492A and 11984A) included an active comparator arm (venlafaxine 225 mg and duloxetine 60 mg, resp.) but one trial failed (11984A). In this latter trial, the effect of neither vortioxetine nor duloxetine was better than placebo in the primary LOCF analysis. However, the MMRM analysis showed a separation (p&lt;0.05) from placebo in favour of vortioxetine 5 and 10 mg/day and duloxetine, but not for vortioxetine 2.5 mg/day, which was slightly above the clinical relevant effect size of 2 (2.5, 2.6 and 3 points for vortioxetine 2.5,2.6 and duloxetine, respectively). The other two trials were placebo-controlled trials (305 and 316) but one did not show superiority over placebo and is therefore considered negative (316).</p><p>The inclusion of 3 additional short-term studies to the initial meta-analysis of 8 short-term studies generally resulted in lower overall effect sizes in the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. Looking at the global data package, the effect sizes of vortioxetine treatment are lower than previously estimated on the basis of the 8 short-term studies but still separate statistically from placebo.</p><p>No specific dose adjustments are considered necessary based on patient´s age alone. However, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly especially with doses higher than 10 mg for which data are limited. The lowest effective dose of 5 mg should always be used as starting dose and patients should be carefully monitored when an increase in dose is required.</p><p>One relapse prevention study was performed, whereby responders to vortioxetine after 12 weeks of open label treatment were randomised between vortioxetine and placebo. The study demonstrated a statistically significant difference in time to relapse between vortioxetine and placebo, in favour of vortioxetine. No difference in efficacy between severely depressed patients and patients with moderate/mild depression was found.</p><p>In some of the placebo-controlled studies, an active reference was included as internal control.</p><p>Although no formal comparison was conducted, , numerically larger effect sizes were observed for the active reference than for Vortioxetine, except in Studies 11492A and 11984A. The exclusion of nonresponders and the inclusion of previous responders in the active reference arm could have introduced a bias in favour of the efficacy of the active reference, so differences in the efficacy of Vortioxetine versus the active reference cannot be inferred on the basis of these studies.</p><p>The long-term studies aimed at investigating clinical safety rather than efficacy and did not include a placebo control. The studies suggest maintenance of the clinical effect. The mean MADRS total score at</p><p>Week 52 was about 5 indicating that, on average, remission (MADRS≤10) was achieved in the patient population. However, the minimum and maximum values of the MADRS total score were 0 and 20, resp. This indicates that after one year treatment, some patients were total remitters (MADRS score of 0) whereas others remained depressed .</p><p>To summarise:</p><p>-Vortioxetine 1 mg/day was efficacious in the one study in which it was investigated.</p><p>-Vortioxetine 2.5 mg/day was not efficacious in either of the two studies in which it was investigated.</p><p>-Vortioxetine 5 mg/day was efficacious in five of the eight studies: the results were positive in four studies (two short-term studies in adult patients, the dedicated study in the elderly, and the relapse-prevention study) and supportive in a fifth study as reflected by additional sensitivity analyses in adult patients; no effect was observed in three short-term studies in adult patients.</p><p>-Vortioxetine 10 mg/day was efficacious in seven of the eight studies in which it was investigated: the results were positive in four studies (three short-term studies and the relapse-prevention study) and supportive in the remaining three studies as reflected by additional sensitivity analyses.</p><p>-Vortioxetine 15 mg/day was efficacious in one of the three studies in which it was investigated.</p><p>-Vortioxetine 20 mg/day was efficacious in all five studies in which it was investigated; the results were positive in four studies and supportive in one study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MDD short-term pool (updated)</head><p>Updated information on MDD short-term pool, including studies 317, 14122A, and CCT-002:</p><p>In the updated MDD Short-term Pool, the overall incidence of TEAEs for Vortioxetine was similar at 5mg/day (65%), 10mg/day (61%), 15mg/day (69%) and 20mg/day (65%); the incidences in the placebo and duloxetine groups were 58% and 76%. The SOCs with the highest incidences of TEAEs were gastrointestinal disorders and nervous system disorders. The two preferred terms with the highest incidences were nausea (ranging from 21 31% for 5 to 20 mg/day) and headache (ranging from 12 to 15% for 5 to 20 mg/day but similar to placebo 13%).</p><p>In general, the incidences of dizziness, diarrhoea, vomiting, and constipation were slightly higher for VORTIOXETINE than for placebo and slightly higher at 15 and 20mg/day than at 5 and 10mg/day. 34% of duloxetine-and venlafaxine-treated subjects reported nausea in the short-term pool.</p><p>In contrast to duloxetine, VORTIOXETINE was not associated with insomnia, somnolence, fatigue, or hyperhidrosis.</p><p>Among the less frequent TEAEs, abnormal dreams, decreased appetite, pruritus generalised, and influenza had an incidence ≥2% and at least twice that for placebo at one or more of the VORTIOXETINE therapeutic doses.</p><p>Most of the TEAEs reported in the updated MDD short-term pool are not dose-related (e.g. nausea, headache, dizziness, etc.).</p><p>Study 14178A revealed overall consistence with the aforementioned results from the short-term studies: the incidence of AEs was similar in the two treatment groups (55% and 53% in the Vortioxetine and agomelatine groups, respectively). Nausea occurred with a higher incidence in the Vortioxetine group compared to the agomelatine group (16% and 9%, respectively). All other TEAEs with an incidence ≥5% had a higher incidence in the agomelatine group than in the Vortioxetine group and comprised headache (10% in the Vortioxetine group and 13% in the agomelatine group), dizziness (7% in the Vortioxetine group and 12% in the agomelatine group), and somnolence (4% in the Vortioxetine group and 8% in the agomelatine group).</p></div>

All other TEAEs were reported in less than 10% of patients. Of note, 5.8% of patients reported a TEAE of accidental overdose.</p><p>The majority of events were mild to moderate in severity with 13% of TEAEs being classified as severe.</p><p>Severe TEAEs were headache and nausea (1.6% each), and accidental overdose (1.3%).</p><p>The overall adverse event rate in the double-blind phase of the study was similar for placebo and VORTIOXETINE-treated subjects (63.5% and 62.3%). The SOCs with the highest occurrence of TEAEs were infections and infestations, gastrointestinal disorders and nervous system disorders. Preferred terms in the infection and infestation SOC occurred in a similar number in placebo and VORTIOXETINEtreated subjects (nasopharyngitis: 14 and 11%; influenza: 5 and 7%; gastroenteritis: 3 and 2%).</p><p>Nausea was reported nearly three times higher in the VORTIOXETINE group compared to placebo (9 and 3 %). Headache was similar in placebo and active treatment (13 and 12%), and accidental overdose was reported in 8% of placebo and VORTIOXETINE-treated patients each. The majority of events were mild to moderate in severity with 10% of TEAEs being classified as severe in both treatment groups.</p><p>A relatively high reporting rate of "accidental overdose" in study 11985A was explained by the Applicant to be caused by protocol amendment recording each overdose (accidental or intentional) at least as an adverse event. The cases depicted by the Applicant did not raise concern of intentional/suicidal background and events are similarly distributed between placebo and Vortioxetine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GAD long-term relapse prevention study 12473A</head><p>The overall incidence of TEAEs in the open-label period of this study was 77% with gastrointestinal disorders, nervous system disorders, and infections and infestations being the SOCs with the highest percentage of TEAEs (43%, 30%, and 24%). Preferred terms, which contribute to these SOC rates, were nausea (27.1%), headache (17.6%), and influenza (7.6%). Results are very similar to those observed in the MDD long-term relapse-prevention study.</p><p>The overall adverse event rate in the double-blind phase of the study was similar for placebo and VORTIOXETINE-treated subjects (53.9% and 55%). Infections and infestations was the SOC with the highest rate of TEAEs in both groups placebo and VORTIOXETINE (23% and 23.6%). Twice as many subjects on VORTIOXETINE had an AE of influenza compared to placebo (12.2 vs. 6.1%). Clinical pharmacology studies, short-term MDD, short-term MDD and GAD, relapse-prevention studies in MDD and GAD and open-label long-term treatment with VORTIOXETINE gave an overall similar pattern of adverse events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TEAEs in the MDD</head><p>The most common TEAEs during short-term and long-term treatment that occurred in ≥10% of VORTIOXETINE-treated patients were nausea and headache. The incidence for nausea was constantly two-to three-fold greater than the incidence in placebo-treated patients and dose-related (up to 21 -31% of subjects in the MDD short-term pool).</p><p>Headache (up to 20%) and dizziness (&lt; 10%) were most often mentioned within the nervous system disorder SOC and also dose-related. Incidences were only slightly lower for placebo-treated subjects.</p><p>Most of the TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity. Severe adverse events were reported in a similar range in placebo and VORTIOXETINE-treated subjects (about 5-6%).</p><p>MDD short-term Pool studies serve as a basis for ADRs with a total of 3904 patients treated with Vortioxetine up to 20 mg/day and with 1968 patients receiving placebo. The causal relationship of adverse events attributed to Vortioxetine was determined by a dose-response relationship or an incidence of ≥ 1.5-times compared to placebo. Allocation to the respective frequency columns followed the SmPC guidance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Suicidal ideation and behaviour</head><p>Patients with a significant risk of suicide were excluded from the VORTIOXETINE clinical development programme.</p><p>Suicidal ideation and self-injurious behaviour during treatment with VORTIOXETINE in the phase II/III studies was investigated based on TEAEs captured using the SMQ Suicide/Selfinjury. In addition, suicidal ideation and behaviour was captured prospectively using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) in 3 clinical pharmacology studies, 811 phase II/III studies in MDD, and 5 phase III studies in GAD assessed suicidal ideation and behaviour using the C-SSRS. The C-SSRS scores (1 to 10) were mapped into the Columbia Classification Algorithm for Suicide Assessment (C-CASA).</p><p>In the clinical development programme for Vortioxetine, 1 completed suicide and 9 suicide attempts have been reported in patients treated with Vortioxetine, corresponding to an overall incidence of fatal and non-fatal suicide attempts of 0.34 per 100 PYE (95% CI: 0.16; 0.62).</p><p>Suicidality was evaluated for all pools and in terms of TEAEs and also using a validated rating scale. As a result, TEAEs with respect to suicide/self-injury (SMQ) were considered spontaneous and therefore, percentages were lower compared to rating scale results.</p><p>In the updated short-term MDD studies (and similarly during short-term MDD and GAD studies), 0.4%</p><p>of Vortioxetine-and 0.5% of placebo-treated patients reported TEAEs of suicidal ideation. This number was slightly increased in the MDD open-label long-term pool (0.5%).</p><p>Suicide attempts did occur in the Vortioxetine group in the MDD short-term pool (n=4), in the MDD relapse-prevention study (n=1), in one patient from the MDD open-label long-term pool, in two patients from the MDD ongoing open-label long-term pool and in one placebo-treated subjectin the MDD short-term pool One completed suicide was reported in the clinical study program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Brintellix</head><p>When using the C-SSRS, suicidal ideation was reported for 14.5% of Vortioxetine-treated patients and 16% of placebo-treated patients in the updated MDD short-term studies (MDD and GAD short-term studies). Elderly patients seemed to be at lower risk for suicidal ideation (12% for Vortioxetine vs.</p><p>10% for placebo). MDD open-label long-term study 301 showed a slight decrease in patients with suicidal ideation (9.6%) and during GAD long-term relapse-prevention study 12473A, suicidal ideation decreased to 2% in Vortioxetine-treated patients (vs. 3.5% placebo) during the double-blind phase of the study. Suicidal behaviour occurred in 1.3% of placebo-treated subjects and in 0.4% of Vortioxetine-treated subjects.</p><p>Suicidal ideation differs between MDD and GAD studies (lower incidence in GAD studies compared to MDD studies) suggesting the underlying disease to be the main reason for these events. The fact, that all of the reported suicide attempts happened in MDD patients, is in support of this assumption.</p><p>Nevertheless, since suicidality is considered a class effect of antidepressant medication, close monitoring of suicidal events is needed. Since suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviour is a class effect known for SSRIs, SNRIs, and TCAs, it is implemented in the risk management plan as important potential risk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Further adverse events of special interest</head><p>Across the clinical study program, 2 patients had convulsions (in both cases there was an alternative aetiology).</p><p>The potential risk for convulsions in people with a history of convulsions is included in the SmPC.</p><p>One patient in the VORTIOXETINE groups had a mild episode of serotonin syndrome (without neuromuscular rigidity and hyperthermia, which characterise life-threatening episodes).</p><p>No additional case of seizure or serotonin syndrome was reported in the additional 1656 patients from the updated MDD short-term pool. The clinical presentation of serotonin syndrome is variable and often aspecific, diagnosing serotonin syndrome can be challenging, particularly in mild cases. Therefore, serotonin syndrome remains a potential risk.</p><p>However, there is evidence that antidepressants could contribute to the occurrence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome <ref type="bibr">(Heinemann F., Assion H.-J., Laux G. 1997</ref> The PASS will provide more information on the use, efficacy, adverse events and withdrawals in this subpopulation.</p><p>For several antidepressants, insomnia and related adverse events such as somnolence, delayed sleep phase, and nocturnal awakening are described as common clinical problems. The incidence of insomnia and somnolence were similar to placebo, this in contrast to duloxetine which is associated with insomnia and somnolence. The updated MDD short-term pool revealed insomnia (somnolence)related TEAEs for 3.7% (2.3%) of placebo-treated subjects and 3.9% (3.0%) of Vortioxetine-treated subjects. There was no indication of a dose-response relationship in the VORTIOXETINE groups.</p><p>Most antidepressants, including those with a serotonergic effect, are related with sexual dysfunction.</p><p>In the clinical studies, adverse events related to sexual dysfunction were evaluated based on spontaneously reported TEAEs and, in 6 short-term studies (2.5 to 20mg), also based on the ASEX.</p><p>The latter allowed identifying patients without sexual dysfunction at baseline but who developed treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction (TESD) during treatment.</p><p>In the updated MDD short-term pool, the overall incidence of sexual dysfunction TEAEs during treatment with VORTIOXETINE was low (1.6%) and similar to that in the placebo group (0.9%). It was 4.5% in the duloxetine group and 12.4% in the venlafaxine group, both are associated with sexual dysfunction. In the VORTIOXETINE dose groups (not updated), the incidence of sexual dysfunction</p><p>TEAEs ranged from 0% in the 1mg group to 2.6% in the 20mg group; however, there was no doseresponse relationship as the incidences in the 2.5mg, 5mg, 10mg, and 15mg groups were 2.3%, 1.6%, Looking at treatment emergent sexual dysfunction (TESD) based on ASEX scoring for the therapeutic dose range (5mg to 20mg), there was no clear dose-response relationship in the incidence of TESD during treatment with VORTIOXETINE. However, there is an increase in TESD going from the 5 to the 20 mg group. The overall incidence of TESD during treatment with VORTIOXETINE was 38% which was slightly higher than that in the placebo group (32%). In the duloxetine group, the incidence of TESD was 48%. The incidence of TESD was 43 and 46% in the VORTIOXETINE 15 and 20 mg groups, respectively, and the latter is close to the duloxetine level. There was a tendency for the proportion of women with TESD to be slightly larger than the proportion of men with TESD for all doses and in all treatment groups, including placebo.</p><p>Increase in TESD for the 20 mg VORTIOXETINE dose group compared to placebo has been added to section 5.1 of the SmPC.</p><p>The incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (akathisia and dyskinesia) may be adverse effects of psychotropic treatment. Akathisia is most of all believed to occur subsequently to dopaminergic/noradrenergic neurotransmission. Vortioxetine exerts its mode of action via the serotonergic system, but with minor influence on other neurotransmitter systems. In the updated MDD short-term pool, the incidence of TEAEs captured in the SMQ Akathisia and Dyskinesia were similar in the placebo group (0.6% and 0.3%) and in the VORTIOXETINE total group (0.7% and 0.3%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Brintellix</head><p>Vortioxetine exerts its antidepressive mechanism solely by serotonergic regulation, similar to duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, and sertraline. As platelet aggregation is inhibited by serotonin transporter inhibition, drugs that inhibit the serotonin transporter may result in increased bleeding tendencies. Clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted to assess the potential of VORTIOXETINE to affect the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and aspirin. No significant effects have been observed. Also, to assess the potential effect of VORTIOXETINE on bleeding, blood samples for platelet count have been taken throughout the VORTIOXETINE clinical development programme. The mean platelet counts did not show any clinically relevant changes over time. In the clinical studies, the overall incidence of TEAEs related to haemorrhage was not higher for VORTIOXETINE than for placebo (updated MDD short-term pool: 1.3%</p><p>for placebo and 1.4% for total Vortioxetine).</p><p>In the MDD short-term pool TEAEs were captured for the SMQ Severe cutaneous adverse reactions.</p><p>The incidence was similar in the placebo and the VORTIOXETINE groups (0.2% for placebo and 0.1%</p><p>for Vortioxetine).</p><p>There was no increased incidence of osteoporosis seen from the data from the clinical studies.</p><p>However, published data strongly point towards a serotonergic effect on bone mineral density and vortioxetine also modifies serotonergic signalling.

TEAEs were evaluated using the adverse event cluster search Abuse Liability: In the updated MDD short-term pool, a similar number of patients in the placebo and Vortioxetine group had Brintellix AEs (4.0% and 3.7%). Most AEs were due to irritability (1.5% and 1.1%) and sedation (0.6% and 1.1%). Other pools confirmed these results.</p><p>The Applicant investigated withdrawal symptoms. The DESS were low and similar in nature as the adverse events observed during the study. These do not indicate a dependence liability.</p><p>The intake of overdose was low and mainly involved the accidental intake of 1 or 2 additional tablets.</p><p>The number of adverse events potentially related to abuse liability was low and similar in all treatment groups.</p><p>Therefore, it is agreed that a clinical abuse liability study is not necessary at the moment. The</p><p>Applicant will monitor the occurrence of drug discontinuation symptoms as part of the routine pharmacovigilance activities. The newly released SMQ for Drug Abuse, Dependence and Withdrawal (MedDRA 15.0, section 2.22) will be used to identify cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discontinuation symptoms</head><p>Six short-term studies (5 in MDD and 1 in GAD) and the long-term relapse-prevention studies in MDD and GAD were designed to investigate the occurrence of potential discontinuation symptoms following abrupt discontinuation of treatment with Vortioxetine.</p><p>In addition, update of study CCT-002 included a 2-week discontinuation period following abrupt discontinuation of placebo or Vortioxetine 5mg, 10mg, or 20mg/day.</p><p>Overall, there was no evidence of clinically relevant discontinuation symptoms that warranted a dose tapering of Vortioxetine. Due to the long plasma elimination half-life of 66 hours and the gradual elimination from the central 5-HT transporter, there is a relatively long natural down-taper.</p><p>At this time, discontinuation symptoms are referred to in the SmPC as not relevant for Vortioxetine and subsequently, there seems to be no need for gradual dose reduction of the substance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Serious adverse events and deaths Deaths</head><p>There were no deaths in the clinical pharmacology studies.</p><p>As of updated cut-off date 31st August 2013, 6 deaths had been reported in the clinical development programme, all patients were in the Vortioxetine study groups. Deaths were reported consequently due to cancer (2), suicide (1), morphine intoxication (1), and accidents (2). According to the investigator, there was no apparent pattern in the causes of death and were not clearly related to the study medication.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Applicant could not further clarify the circumstances of two death cases suspect of a suicidal background (morphine intoxication and fall from a balcony) and one completed suicide.</p><p>However, one could assume from the narratives of these cases that at least the subject who fell from a balcony has a suicidal background.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Laboratory findings</head><p>The clinical safety laboratory test results indicate that short-or long-term treatment with Vortioxetine is not associated with clinically relevant changes in any of the tests that were assessed. The mean changes and the proportions of patients with shifts from normal values at baseline to out-of-range values at last assessment or with potentially clinically significant (PCS) values were at placebo level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Liver and kidney toxicity</head><p>The liver function test results were further evaluated using additional outlier criteria and the results showed no impact of Vortioxetine on liver function as compared to placebo.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Weight and lipid values</head><p>In general, the proportion of patients with abnormal lipid values was high. In the MDD Short-term Pool, the LDL cholesterol value at baseline was above the reference range in nearly 60% of the patients. However, both during short-and long-term treatment with Vortioxetine, the mean changes were at placebo level, and the proportion of patients with shifts from normal at baseline to a value above the reference range was not higher than that with placebo.</p><p>During long-term treatment in the Double-blind Period of the relapse-prevention study in MDD, the mean weight increase for Vortioxetine (0.4kg) was also at placebo level (0.6kg). These results were supported by those in the relapse-prevention study in GAD and the open-label, long-term studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>QT-interval prolongation</head><p>A thorough QT study has been conducted to evaluate the potential of Vortioxetine to cause QTcinterval prolongation. The administration of Vortioxetine 10 or 40mg/day for 14 days to healthy men had no clinically significant effect on cardiac repolarisation using the ICH E14 definitions. Although, the study shows a clear tendency of the higher dose of Vortioxetine 40 mg/day to increase the QT interval. ECGs have been reviewed throughout the clinical development programme. In the MDD short-term pool, the incidence of PCS high RR interval values was 1.2% in the placebo group and ranged in the therapeutic Vortioxetine dose groups from 1.1% in the 15mg group to 2.6% (25 patients) in the 5mg group. The incidence of PCS low PR interval values in the placebo group was 2.1% and ranged in the therapeutic Vortioxetine dose groups from 2.7% in the 10mg group to 4.6% in the 15mg group.</p><p>In the MDD relapse-prevention study, during the double-blind period, the incidences of PCS ECG parameter values were low. PCS ECG parameter values with an incidence ≥2% in either treatment group were:</p><p>• low PR interval (placebo group: 4.3%; Vortioxetine group: 3.0%)</p><p>• high QTcB (placebo group: 1.1%; Vortioxetine group: 2.0%)</p><p>• high RR interval (placebo group: 3.2%; Vortioxetine group: 1.5%)</p><p>In the ongoing open-label long-term safety pool, at the cut-off of 26 October 2012, the ECG parameter values with an incidence of PCS values ≥2% were high RR interval (2.4%) and low PR interval (3.9%).</p><p>Searches were performed using the SMQ Torsade de Pointes/QT Prolongation.</p><p>In the MDD short-term pool, the majority of the events captured in this SMQ were ECG QT prolonged.</p><p>All the events were non-serious and none of them were reported as arrhythmias or torsade de pointes.</p><p>No events in the placebo or Vortioxetine dose groups resulted in withdrawal from the study. One patient in the Vortioxetine 10 mg group had syncope; one patient in the Vortioxetine 2.5mg group had loss of consciousness (severe event; concurrent with an accident In the clinical studies, the incidences of potentially prolactin-related TEAEs were at the placebo level during short-and long-term treatment with Vortioxetine.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sex</head><p>Pharmacokinetic assessment with respect to sex revealed exposure increases of up to 30% in women.</p><p>In the MDD short-term pool, the incidence of TEAEs leading to withdrawal was similar between men and women in the Vortioxetine 5mg group. In the Vortioxetine 10mg, 15mg, and 20mg groups, the incidences of TEAEs leading to withdrawal was higher for women (6.5%, 9.5%, and 9.3%, respectively) than for men (4.5%, 5.2%, and 6.3%, respectively). In the MDD Short-term Pool, the incidences of TEAEs were similar between men and women, except for nausea, which was consistently lower in men than in women in the therapeutic Vortioxetine dose groups, the active reference groups, and the placebo group. The incidence of nausea increased in a dose-dependent manner in both men (from 17% in the 5mg group to 22% in the 20mg group) and women (from 23% in the 5mg group to 35% in the 20 mg group).</p><p>The incidence of TEAEs and more specifically of nausea is higher in women than in men, which is referred to in section 4.8 of the SmPC. The pharmacokinetically observed slightly higher exposure in women than in men possibly contributes to this effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Age</head><p>Age-related differences were found in pharmacokinetic studies with subjects aged ≥65 years having approximately 30% higher exposure to Vortioxetine compared to subjects aged 45 years and younger after treatment with multiple doses of 10 mg/d.   The short-term safety in the elderly has been investigated in study 12541A, using 5 mg/day of VORTIOXETINE while the currently recommended dosage in the SmPC is 10 mg once daily.</p><p>PK data indicate an increased exposure in the elderly aged ≥65 years (approximately 30%) compared to subjects aged 45 years and younger after treatment with multiple doses of 10 mg/d. On this basis, no dose adjustment in elderly is required, although a higher number of AEs can be expected.</p><p>A dose of 5mg/day was shown to be safe and well tolerated in the elderly population.</p><p>Data from the MDD short term pool indicate that the 10 mg/day dose does not lead to larger amount of TEAEs, but to a higher number of study withdrawals due to TEAEs.</p><p>In the MDD open-label long-term pool (5 and 10 mg/day), the incidence of nausea was slightly higher in patients aged &lt;65 years than in patients aged ≥65 years (18% and 11%, respectively).</p><p>For the 15 mg/day dose, the number of patients is too small to draw clear conclusions (n=21 for short term and n=14 for long term). In the MDD short-term pool, the incidences of TEAEs and TEAEs leading to withdrawal were increased. For the 20 mg/day dose, the long term data are also limited (n=25). In the updated MDD short-term pool an increase in TEAEs, especially nausea and constipation was observed, as well as an increase in TEAEs leading to withdrawal. The incidence of nausea increased in the 20 mg/day group from 27% in patients below 65 years to 42 % in patients ≥ 65. In the MDD ongoing long-term pool (15 and 20 mg/day) data are too scarce to draw conclusions.</p><p>The use of doses above 10mg/day in the elderly population shows limitations regarding the number of patients studied with these doses. At this moment no major safety concerns in the elderly population have been observed, however due to the limited data in the elderly population for doses above 10 mg/day, the increased exposure in elderly and an increase in TEAEs and TEAEs leading to withdrawal Brintellix for the 15 and 20 mg/day dose in the short term pool, a dose increase should be undertaken only with particular caution, as reflected in the SmPC.</p><p>Few elderly patients were treated with the higher doses during the long-term studies. There are generally more adverse effects in patients &gt;65 years of age, e.g. those leading to treatment discontinuation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BMI</head><p>In the MDD Short-term Pool, the incidence of TEAEs leading to withdrawal, the overall incidence of TEAEs, and the types of TEAEs with an incidence ≥5% in the VORTIOXETINE groups were generally similar among the different BMI categories.</p></div>

Of the 879 non-PMs, 518, 242, and 162 subjects received at least one dose of VORTIOXETINE ≤10mg, 15 to 30mg, and ≥40mg, respectively. The mean duration of exposure in these dose categories was 9.3, 5.3, and 8.5 days, respectively.</p><p>The incidences of TEAEs leading to withdrawal were 4.9% (2 subjects) and 2.4% (21 subjects) in the PM group and the non-PM group, respectively. The TEAEs leading to withdrawal in the PM group were vomiting and angioedema. In the non-PM group, the most common TEAE leading to withdrawal was vomiting (4 subjects); all other TEAEs leading to withdrawal did not occur in &gt;2 subjects. The TEAEs with an incidence ≥5% in both groups were: nausea, diarrhoea, headache, and dizziness.</p><p>Nausea, dizziness, pruritus and pruritus generalised were higher in the PM group than in the non-PMs.</p><p>An approximately two-fold increase in VORTIOXETINE exposure was seen following coadministration of bupropion (a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor). When bupropion was added to VORTIOXETINE 10mg/day at steady state, a higher incidence of adverse events was observed than when VORTIOXETINE was added to bupropion at steady state. This may be explained by pharmacodynamic or combined pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic effects following CYP2D6 inhibition with bupropion, which seem to be more pronounced when the inhibition is initiated when VORTIOXETINE is in steady state than before VORTIOXETINE is administered. Depending on the individual patient response, a lower dose of VORTIOXETINE may be considered if strong CYP2D6 inhibitors are added to VORTIOXETINE treatment.</p><p>The frequency of some adverse effects is doubled in the PM group, like for dizziness and pruritus.</p><p>Probably, the dose will also have an influence. Therefore, this additional aspect should be taken into account in this analysis of PMs versus non-PMs. However, analysis based on grouping by genotype of patients in the phase II/III studies is not possible as no genotyping was performed. Blood sampling for plasma concentrations of Vortioxetine was performed in patients from Studies 11492A, 11984A, 12541A, 13267A, 305, 315, and 316, which allows for a pooling of adverse events by average plasma concentration (Cav). 10% of patients with the highest C av were a substitute for low clearance and the 10% of patients with the lowest C av for high clearance.</p><p>Brintellix Only in the 20 mg VORTIOXETINE group, the incidence of adverse events was higher in the lowclearance group than in the normal-clearance group.

The subject incidence of headache and procedural site reaction were similar in all of the treatment groups (VORTIOXETINE and placebo). Diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort and abdominal pain were more common in subjects receiving VORTIOXETINE compared with those receiving placebo. For diarrhoea and abdominal discomfort the incidence was generally higher at the highest dose (60 mg). It is of note that 13 of the 18 men receiving active treatment had abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain or diarrhoea during the first 3 days of dosing.

Significantly higher incidences of AEs were observed when bupropion 150 mg BID was added to the VORTIOXETINE 10 mg QD monotherapy (related AE from 60 to 89%). No corresponding increase in the incidence of AEs was observed when VORTIOXETINE 10 mg QD was added to the bupropion 150 mg BID monotherapy. AEs with the greatest incidence were nausea (60% and 30% respectively), headache (43 and 47%), vomiting (33 and 23%), insomnia (33 and 7%), palpitations (20 and 13%), hyperhidrosis (20 and 10%), constipation (23 and 0%), dizziness (23 and 13%), postural dizziness (23 and 13%), dyspepsia (13 and 10%) and tremor (13 and 10%).</p><p>According to the results from bupropion interaction Study 117, CYP 2D6 plays a major role in metabolism of Vortioxetine and CYP 2D6 inhibitors like bupropion increase exposure to Vortioxetine (in terms of AUC) with concomitantly increased rates in adverse events, e.g. vomiting, nausea, insomnia, dizziness.

A search was conducted including strong CYP 2D6 inhibitors others than antidepressants and a total of six patients were found with strong inhibitors, mainly with terbinafine. No new adverse events were reported which could lead to the assumption of an altered safety profile of Vortioxetine. However, since data on concomitant administration with other strong CYP2D6 inhibitors like fluoxetine and paroxetine are lacking, no final conclusion can be drawn at this time. The Applicant included further potent CYP2D6 inhibitors to SmPC section 4.2 in regard to dose reduction while on combination therapy with potent CYP2D6 inhibitors.</p><p>Study 115 evaluated the potential interaction of Vortioxetine and rifampicin (a broad inducer of CYP isoforms): Co-administration of Vortioxetine 20 mg and rifampicin 600 mg following multiple doses of rifampicin 600 mg, led to a 72% reduction in AUC(0-tlqc), a 77% reduction in AUC(0-inf), and a 51% reduction in the Cmax of Vortioxetine.

In the open-label extension studies, the incidence of TEAEs leading to withdrawal during long-term treatment with 2.5 to 10mg/day was 6.2% (MDD Open-label Long-term Pool) and the incidence during long-term treatment with 15 or 20mg/day (MDD Ongoing Long-term Pool) was 10%.</p><p>Nausea was the most common TEAE leading to withdrawal in each of the active treatment groups and more frequently compared to the placebo group. For VORTIOXETINE, the incidence of nausea leading to withdrawal increased with dose and, for the therapeutic doses, it ranged from 1.1% at 5mg/day to 3.8% at 15mg/day. Nausea as an AE leading to withdrawal was reported in 3.3% of subjects from the 20mg Vortioxetine dosing group. The majority of the patients who withdrew due to nausea did so within the first 3 weeks of treatment.

Nevertheless, single SAEs recurring over all analysed pools were spontaneous abortion, depression, suicidal ideation/attempt/completed suicide. Of note and special interest, 21% of SAEs in the ongoing open-label long-term pool with 15 and 20 mg Vortioxetine were from the neoplasm SOC, which is considered a high number.

Discontinuation symptoms were also assessed in three MDD short-term studies using the discontinuation-emergent signs and symptoms checklist (DESS). The overall DESS scores in the Vortioxetine groups were slightly higher compared to placebo after Discontinuation Week 1 and 2.

In the thorough QT Study, the administration of Vortioxetine 10 or 40mg/day for 14 days to healthy men had no clinically significant effect on cardiac repolarisation using the ICH E14 definitions. Although, the study shows a clear tendency of the higher dose of Vortioxetine 40 mg/day to increase the QT interval. Furthermore, the adverse events did not raise any signals of QT prolongation or arrhythmias. Tachycardia was reported to occur at a higher incidence in Vortioxetine-Brintellix treated subjects compared to placebo (3.5% for Vortioxetine 10 mg and 2.4% for Vortioxetine 40 mg vs. 1.2% in placebo-treated subjects).

Nausea was the most common adverse event leading to withdrawal and more so with the higher doses. Other common adverse events were headache, dry mouth, dizziness, and diarrhoea.

These doses were found to be superior compared to placebo as demonstrated by a significant reduction of baseline MADRS or HAM-D24 total score after 6 or 8 weeks of treatment and the clinical relevance of the effect was supported by the proportions of responders and remitters and the improvement in the CGI-I score.</p><p>In the meta-analyses, the average effect size of the MADRS versus placebo ranged between -2.6 points (p=0.008) for the lowest therapeutic dose (5mg/day) and -4.6 points (p &lt;0.001) for the highest therapeutic dose (20 mg/day). The average effect size was -4.1 points (p &lt;0.001) for the 10 mg/day doses. The 15 mg/day dose did not separate from placebo in the meta-analysis, but the mean difference to placebo was -3.5 points.

In the meta-analysis including these studies the overall mean difference to placebo across the studies remained statistically significant: -2.3 points (p = 0.007), -3.6 points (p &lt;0.001), and -4.6 points (p &lt;0.001) for the 5, 10, and 20 mg/day doses, respectively; again, the 15mg/day dose did not separate from placebo in the meta-analysis, but the mean difference to placebo was -2.6 points.</p><p>Whilst the inclusion of the above mentioned 3 additional short-term studies in the the meta-analysis initially only including the 8 short-term studies generally resulted in lower effect sizes in the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, results are still in favour of vortioxetine, as supported by the pooled responder analysis.</p><p>The efficacy of vortioxetine 10 or 20 mg/day was further demonstrated in a 12-week, double-blind, flexible-dose comparative study versus agomelatine 25 or 50 mg/day in patients with MDD.</p><p>Vortioxetine was statistically significantly better than agomelatine as measured by improvement in the MADRS total score. Clinical relevance of the effect was supported by the proportions of responders and remitters and improvement in the CGI-I scores.</p><p>In one relapse prevention study, the risk to relapse was two times higher for placebo-treated patients than for vortioxetine-treated patients, and there was a statistically superior effect of vortioxetine 5 and 10 mg/day relative to placebo on the time to relapse of MDD.</p><p>In addition, maintained efficacy of vortioxetine was also supported by four open-label extension studies</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects</head><p>A dose range from 5 to 20 mg/day with a starting dose of 10mg/day is considered to be justified for patients &lt; 65 years, however since data are limited in patients ≥ 65 years for doses higher than 10mg/day particular caution should be exercised, and the starting dose should be 5 mg/day in the elderly.</p><p>Concerning depression history, relatively slight imbalances between treatment arms were reported across studies for the median number of previous episodes and duration of the current episode. Since there is no indication that randomization and allocation concealment were compromised during the conduct of the studies, these imbalances most likely reflect a random process.</p><p>The mechanism of action of vortioxetine in patients is not totally clarified. The claimed multimodal effects of vortioxetine acting at several receptor targets and at the 5-HTT is considered responsible for Brintellix EMA/699150/2013 Page 155/159 the antidepressant effect. However overall, a convincing independent effect on cognition and function (HrQoL) (beyond antidepressant effect)remains to be shown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risks</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unfavourable effects</head><p>The types of AEs were generally comparable to those seen for the antidepressant duloxetine. Up to one-third of all patients reported nausea as most common adverse event under Vortioxetine treatment being of highest occurrence during the first weeks of treatment. The incidence of nausea was shown to be higher at doses of 15 and 20 mg/day compared to doses of 5 and 10 mg/day. However, similar numbers were seen in the comparator groups venlafaxine and duloxetine. There seems to be a slight reduction in nausea during long-term treatment with Vortioxetine. For the TEAEs dizziness, diarrhoea, and vomiting, the incidences in the Vortioxetine groups were higher compared to placebo. The severe / discontinuation due to AEs were predominantly in the gastrointestinal disorder (GI), nervous system disorder, and psychiatric disorder organ class (SOC). Serious AEs recurring over all analysed pools were spontaneous abortion, depression, suicidal ideation/attempt/completed suicide.</p><p>Suicidality has been comprehensively addressed in the dossier as requested by the Draft Guideline on vs. 0% each in the controlled MDD short-term pool) and at this time, there seems to be no increased risk for suicidality under Vortioxetine treatment compared to other antidepressants with a similar mode of action. Nevertheless, the proposed PASS study will further caractherise this potential risk. A warning on suicidality is placed in section 4.4 of the SmPC.</p><p>Convulsions, serotonin syndrome and neuroleptic malignant syndrome are referred to as potential risk.</p><p>Vortioxetine seems to be benign in terms of EPS effects, QT prolongation, renal and hepatic toxicity, body weight. Sexual dysfunction was similar to placebo and lower compared to venlafaxine with no negative effect on long-term treatment. However, looking at treatment emergent sexual dysfunction (TESD) based on ASEX scoring, there is an increase in TESD going from the 5 to the 20 mg group. The incidence of TESD was 43 and 46% in the Vortioxetine 15 and 20 mg groups, respectively, and the latter is close to the duloxetine level, which is associated with sexual dysfunction.</p><p>In the elderly study, treatment with Vortioxetine 5mg/day was safe and well tolerated and the safety profile was not different from that in patients aged &lt;65 years. In the pooled studies, in the Vortioxetine 20 mg group, the incidences of nausea and constipation were higher in patients aged ≥65 years (42% and 15%, respectively); than in patients aged &lt;65 years (27% and 4%, respectively).</p><p>These are tolerability rather than safety issues. The TEAEs led more often to withdrawal from the study in the elderly (≥65 years).</p><p>been included in the clinical studies. These patients may be additionally affected by hyponatraemia while receiving co-medication (e.g. diuretics).</p><p>Patients with a history of mania or hypomania were excluded from the studies; therefore the possible switch from depression to mania as a result of Vortioxetine treatment has not been investigated. A PASS will provide further information on the use, efficacy, adverse events and withdrawals in patients with (a history of) mania/hypomania.</p><p>Vortioxetine treatment was not associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation or behaviour, based on the TEAEs and C-SSRS, although patients with a significant risk of suicide were excluded from the Vortioxetine clinical development programme.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Balance</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects</head><p>Short and long-term efficacy of vortioxetine for the treatment of major depressive episodes in adult patients has been established. From a safety point of view, the types of adverse events reported were similar to those already known from other serotonin-accented antidepressants.</p><p>Remaining uncertainties will be addressed in a non-interventional PASS study, covering the important potential risks of suicidal ideation/behaviour, convulsions/seizures, severe renal and hepatic disorders as well as important missing safety information, which pertains to off-label use (indication), off-label use in paediatrics, use in pregnant women, use in patients aged ≥75 years, use in patients with a history of mania/hypomania, use in patients with Alzheimer`s disease, Parkinson`s disease, MS and stroke, and use in patients with sever renal or hepatic impairment. Additional information on the safety and tolerability (including withdrawal rate due to AEs) of the 15 and 20 mg/day dose of vortioxetine on the long-term in patients 65 years and older will also be captured within the RMP. In addition, data on withdrawals due to lack of efficacy/loss of efficacy will be collected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit-risk balance</head><p>The overall Benefit /Risk of Brintellix is positive for the 5 to 20 mg/day dose range in adults aged &lt;65 years of age. Caution is advised when treating patients ≥ 65 years of age with doses higher than 10 mg vortioxetine for which data are limited.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment</head><p>This new medicine provides an additional alternative for the treatment of patients with MDD. Efficacy of Vortioxetine versus placebo was demonstrated in 9 (7 positive and 2 supportive) of the 12 shortterm studies and in the long-term treatment of MDD in adults and the elderly. About one-third of the studies were either failed or negative in the primary analysis. However, negative studies are not uncommon in MD due to the lack of sensitivity.</p><p>Efficacy was shown on the broad spectrum of depressive symptoms and in patients with severe MDD.</p><p>The clinical relevance was supported by the proportions of responders and remitters and the improvement in the CGI-I score. However, specific effects due to the postulated new mechanism of action on cognition and function have not yet been convincingly demonstrated and remain to be shown. Uncertainties pertaining to long-term efficacy data of the higher doses and dose range in the elderly are addressed with appropriate warnings in the SmPC.</p><p>Uncertainties including the largely unexplained lower response in the US remain although efficacy in the treatment of MDD is considered to be proven.</p><p>The safety profile of vortioxetine was shown to be comparable to other serotonin-accented antidepressants. Unfavourable effects are mainly those pertaining to tolerability issues like GI disorders, especially nausea, and to nervous system disorders, especially headache and most commonly reported adverse events are rather mild in nature. Suicidality remains a potential important risk in line with other antidepressants that will be further addressed by means of the PASS study and referred to as a class warning in the SmPC.</p><p>The elderly are considered an important part of the treated population. The evaluation of vortioxetine in the very old population (&gt;75) is limited but will be covered by the PASS. In addition, the Applicant committed to capture information on the safety and tolerability of the 15 and 20 mg/day dose of vortioxetine during short-and long-term treatment in patients ≥ 75 years of age within the scope of the RMP.</p><p>To conclude, the overall benefit risk profile of Vortioxetine in the treatment of major depressive episodes is considered positive.</p></div>

In six of the studies (including the dedicated study in the elderly), a fixed dose of an active reference was included solely for internal validation. The active reference included was either venlafaxine 225 mg/day (Study 11492A) or duloxetine 60 mg/day(studies 11984A, 13267A, 315, 304 and 12541A). The choice of the active comparators is acceptable since venlafaxine and duloxetine are widely approved and used in the treatment of MDD.The relapse-prevention study (study 11985A) had a 12-week open-label, flexible dose period (Vortioxetine 5mg or 10mg) followed by a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose period of at least 24 weeks (Vortioxetine 5mg or 10mg). The studies were designed and conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice. The study designs are generally in accordance with recommendations made in the EMA "Depression guideline" (CPMP/EWP/518/97, Rev 1, April 2002). Three completed and two ongoing open-label, long-term extension studies provide supportive efficacy data. One of these two ongoing studies (study 13267B) was completed between MAA submission and 31 August 2013. The study designs varied in terms of primary endpoints (MADRS or HAM-D scales), secondary endpoints, choice of active comparator, and statistical analysis strategy. The nine pivotal studies included a total of about 5700 patients of whom about 2700 were treated with vortioxetine in the short-term studies. The relapse prevention study with 5 mg and 10 mg doses of vortioxetine included a total of 400 patients in a 24-week double-blind period following a 12-week open label period with 639 patients. Three open-label extension studies included a total of 1443 patients and provided supportive efficacy data.The patients included in the short-term studies had mainly moderate to severe MDD and a moderate level of anxiety symptoms as indicated by baseline scores on the MADRS, the Clinical Global Impression -Severity of Illness (CGI-S), and the HAM-A. Overall the patient population is considered to be a rather homogen sub-population of the general MDD population since frequently occurring comorbidities and suicidal thoughts/suicidality, amongst others, were excluded. This is considered acceptable to to reduce confounders and facilitation of evaluation of the pure antidepressant effect.Approximately one-half to two-thirds of the patients in each of the short-term studies in adults had severe MDD (baseline MADRS total score ≥30). In addition, studies 11492A and 303 only recruited severely depressed patients with a baseline MADRS total score of 34. The exclusion and withdrawal criteria were considered adequate.An additional 4 short-term clinical studies were completed between MAA submission and 31 August 2013. All studies were randomized, double-blind, parallel-group studies. Study 317 was of 8 weeks duration and compared fixed-doses of Vortioxetine 10 and 15 mg versus placebo, study 14178A was of 12 weeks duration and compared flexible doses of 10 and 20 mg of Vortioxetine versus flexible doses of agomelatine (25 or 50 mg/day) in MDD patients, study CCT-002 was an 8-week study in about 70 % Caucasian and 30% Asian (mainly Japanese) patients and compared fixed doses of Vortioxetine (5,10 or 20 mg/day) versus placebo. These three studies had the MADRS as primary endpoint whereas the primary objective of study 14122A was to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with Vortioxetine 10 or 20 mg/day versus placebo on cognitive dysfunction. No active comparator was included in this latter study.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_4"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>cognitive symptoms were evaluated in four studies. The neuropsychological tests Rey Auditory Verbal learning Test[RAVLT]  (learning and memory) and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test[DSST]    (speed of processing, executive function, and attention) were secondary endpoints in the dedicated study in the elderly. The Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire[CPFQ]  which is a patientreported outcome parameter designed to assess clinically relevant cognitive and physical symptoms associated with depression was an additional endpoint in studies 316 and 317. Cognitive impairment is recognised as an important characteristic during the acute phase of MDD. The applicant´s rationale to conduct neuropsychological tests primarily in the elderly was that cognitive dysfunction in MDD is known to be even more pronounced in the elderly than in adults and is therefore considered more sensitive to change. This is acknowledged, however for an assumed independent effect on cognition it would have been expected to show this effect in the overall population and not only in the elderly population. The Applicant provided study 14122A which was completed between MAA submission and 31 August 2013. The study was conducted in adult patients (aged 18 to 65 years) with MDD and the primary endpoint was a composite score of the DSST (executive function, speed of processing, and attention) and the RAVLT (learning and memory). Although it is acknowledged that with this study an effort was undertaken to study cognitive dysfunction in patients with MDD the results of this study still are not sufficient to support the claim of an independent effect on cognition as outlined above. The main caveat is the lack of an active comparator e.g. duloxetine to provide internal validity (assay sensitivity) of the study.The following patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) assessment tools were included in the evaluation of Vortioxetine: The Study short Form 36 version 2.0 [SF-36 v2] was used as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the effect of Vortioxetine on the patients' HRQoL (5 studies), complemented with the Qualitiy of Life enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form [Q-LES-Q SF] (1 study), the EuroQoL [EQ-5D] (1 study) and the Twelve item Health Status Questionnaire [HSQ-12] (in the elderly population study).The patients' overall functioning was assessed by using the Sheehan Disability Scale [SDS] (9 studies), which provides an assessment of the impact of clinical conditions on the functional domains of work, social and family life. Inclusion of HRQoL assessment tools is in line with the "Reflection paper on the regulatory guidance for the use of health-related quality of life (HRQL) measures in the evaluation of medicinal products"( EMEA/CHMP/EWP/139391/2004). However, analyses of clinical relevance were conducted post hoc and were not pre-defined as requested in the Reflection paper. The justification of clinical relevance for the SDS and SF-36 MCS based on the application of general 'standard' thresholds such as Cohen's rule that an SMD of 0.2 is a small effect size, 0.5 medium and 0.8 is not appropriate, as the relevance of a standardized effect size cannot be evaluated based on a general rule but has to be interpreted in dependence on the context.</figDesc></figure>

The proportion of MADRS and CGI-I responders was statistically significantly higher in the vortioxetine group than in the agomelatine group at Weeks 8 and 12. At Week 12, nearly three-quarters of the patients in the vortioxetine group were responders (FAS, LOCF, logistic regression). The proportion of MADRS and CGI-S remitters was statistically significantly higher in the vortioxetine group than in the agomelatine group at Weeks 8 and 12. At Week 12, more than half of the patients in the vortioxetine group were remitters (FAS, LOCF, logistic regression).As a conclusion, the results of this head-to-head comparison study can be considered as supportive for the claim of efficacy in this group of patients, but cannot be used to claim efficacy of vortioxetine in treatment-resistant patients, neither in patients with MDD who have responded inadequately to SRI antidepressant monotherapy since the included patient population according to the study objective was only retrospectively defined.Study 14122A was conducted in Australia, Canada, Europe, Mexico, South Africa, and the United States. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were essentially the same as those in the other short-term MDD studies. A total of 602 patients were randomised equally (1:1:1) to placebo, Vortioxetine 10mg/day, or Vortioxetine 20mg/day for 8 weeks of double-blind treatment. Approximately 86% of the patients in each treatment group completed the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite cognitive score (z-score) based on the DSST (executive function, speed of processing, and attention) and the RAVLT (learning and memory). Key secondary endpoints were the respective single scores.</figDesc></figure>

Furthermore, without internal validation (i.e. without an active comparator), it is not clear whether path analysis supports a different profile compared to other antidepressants.</figDesc></figure>

A total of 1443 patients received vortioxetine 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg/day. An additional 2557 patients received vortioxetine in the open-label extension studies (1443 patients in the completed studies and 1114 patients in the ongoing studies as of 29 February 2012). No placebo control was included in the 52-week, open-label extension studies.The first extension study (11492C) evaluated the maintenance of the therapeutic effect of 5 mg or 10 mg flexible doses of vortioxetine over a period of 52 weeks in 74 patients with MDD who completed the 6-week short-term Study 11492A. After completing the 6-Week venlafaxine-controlled Study 11492A, eligible patients were switched to a 10 mg/day vortioxetine dose. After the first week, the dose was flexible (5 or 10mg/day) based on the patient's tolerability to treatment, as judged by the investigator.</figDesc></figure>

After completing the 8-Week Study 304 and the US-only Study 304, eligible patients were switched to a 5 mg/day vortioxetine dose. After the first week, the dose was flexible (2.5, 5 or 10mg/day) based on the patient's tolerability to treatment, as judged by the investigator.The mean MADRS total score decreased from 16.6 to 9.3 points and the mean CGI-S score decreased from 3.2 to 2.2 points from Baseline II to the final visit, indicating maintained improvement in depressive symptoms and the global impression during the extension study.Study 13267B is the long-term, open-label, extension study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, as well as the maintenance of the therapeutic effect, of vortioxetine at flexible doses of 15 or 20mg/day over 52 weeks in patients with MDD who had completed lead-in Study 13267A.</figDesc></figure>

Ecotoxicity/As a result of the above considerations, the available data do not allow to conclude definitively on the potential risk of vortioxetine to the environment. The CHMP recommends the following points for further investigation: 1. Submission of Koc values derived from at least one sludge in a batch equilibrium method according to OECD 106 or OPPTS 835.1110. Furthermore, the PECsoil and the PECsw-refined (Tier B) should be recalculated taking into account Koc values derived from at least one sludge to conclude on the risk for the terrestrial environment.2. Submission of a valid and plausible test for collembolan (OECD 232) with test concentrations allowing the determination of a NOEC.</note></figure>
