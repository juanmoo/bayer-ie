<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Scientific discussion</head><p>2.1. Problem statement 2.1.1. Disease or condition X-Linked Hypophosphataemia (XLH) is a rare genetic disease. Patients with XLH have inactivating mutations of the PHEX gene (phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome), which alters the phosphate-sensing control system, leads to chronic renal phosphate wasting, hypophosphataemia, and defective bone mineralisation manifesting as rickets and osteomalacia, and may also impact other tissues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Epidemiology</head><p>X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) is a rare (incidence estimated to 1/200000 new-borns), chronic deforming bone disease. X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) is a dominant disorder and accounts for more than 80% of all familial hypophosphataemia. Although serum phosphate levels are similarly depressed in affected males and females, the degree of bone involvement is substantially less severe in heterozygous females. All hemizygous males are clinically affected. As in all genetic disorders, hypophosphataemic rickets Assessment report EMA/148319/2018 <ref type="bibr">Page 11/130</ref> is present from conception. In most cases, the signs and symptoms of hereditary hypophosphataemic rickets begin in early childhood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3.">Aetiology and pathogenesis</head><p>XLH is characterized by excess levels of circulating fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) that lead to increased urinary phosphate excretion, reduced 1,25(OH) 2 D synthesis, and subsequent hypophosphataemia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.4.">Clinical presentation, diagnosis</head><p>The features of the disorder can vary widely, even among affected members of the same family. Mildly affected individuals may have hypophosphataemia without other signs and symptoms. In children, the main clinical consequences of the disease are rickets, lower extremity skeletal deformities, gait abnormalities and loss of growth potential. In adulthood, the disease is associated with osteomalacia, musculoskeletal pain/stiffness and dental abscesses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.5.">Management</head><p>There is no approved or available therapy that specifically treats the underlying pathophysiology of elevated FGF23-induced hypophosphataemia in XLH. Most children with XLH receive conventional therapy consisting of multiple daily doses of oral phosphate and active vitamin D analogues. Skeletal abnormalities in children with XLH often require surgical correction.</p><p>There is no consensus regarding treatment of adult patients because of concern about safety issues and lack of clinical studies demonstrating efficacy with conventional therapy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.6.">About the product</head><p>Burosumab (KRN23) is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits the excess biological activity of FGF23. The aim of the therapy is to minimise the clinical consequences of the disease by restoring normal serum phosphate levels. -X-Linked Hypophosphataemia (XLH) is a rare, serious, chronic and debilitating genetic disorder. Chronic hypophosphataemia in XLH leads to defective bone mineralisation that manifests as rickets and osteomalacia with subsequent bowing of the leg, physical disability, and decreased height. XLH is also associated with pain, stiffness, fatigue, and functional limitations. -With regards to the unmet medical need, it will be addressed, according to the applicant: No approved or available therapy that specifically treats the underlying pathophysiology of elevated FGF23-induced hypophosphataemia exists. Conventional therapy for paediatric patients with XLH consists of multiple daily doses of oral phosphate, often combined with active vitamin D. Conventional therapy is associated with adverse outcomes and can be cumbersome for healthcare professionals to manage and for patients to comply with, and only a partial benefit on skeletal disease is observed. Data provided by the applicant at time of submission of the application suggests that treatment with KRN23 (burosumab) improves serum phosphate levels and bone mineralisation and are expected to reduce the diverse skeletal and other manifestations associated with hypophosphataemia in XLH patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Type of Application and aspects on development</head><p>The applicant proposed the completion of the following studies to be considered as specific obligations in the The applicant argued that study 301 represents a comprehensive Phase 3 program in paediatric patients with XLH to confirm the positive risk/benefit profile observed in the Phase 1 and 2 studies, including the 2 other phase 2 studies listed above, the completion of which were also considered key to benefit/risk. It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data in a pre-specified timeframe as all 3 studies had completed recruitment at time of submission of this procedure.</p><p>The applicant argued that the benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. Based on the evidence presented at the time of submission of the dossier, the applicant argued that substantial improvement in rickets, growth, and physical function, and the reduction in patient-reported symptoms such as pain, and an acceptable safety profile, justifies early availability of such treatment. Earlier treatment would also lead to better long-term outcomes, according to literature, in particular, as severe bone deformities once progressed and finally fixed with closure of the growth plates cannot be readily reversed and could leave children with life-long deformities and disabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Quality aspects</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Introduction</head><p>The finished product is presented as solution for injection containing burosumab as active substance. Crysvita is provided in three strengths; 10 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg burosumab per 1 ml solution for injection for subcutaneous (SC) administration.</p><p>Other ingredients are L-histidine, D-sorbitol E420, Polysorbate 80, L-methionine, Hydrochloric acid, 10% (for pH adjustment) and water for injections.</p><p>For all three strengths, the product is available as a 1 ml solution in a clear glass vial with butyl rubber stopper, and aluminium seal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Active Substance</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General information</head><p>Burosumab is a human Immunoglobulin G subclass 1 (IgG1) type antibody with a relative molecular mass of approx. 147 kDa. Burosumab is expressed in CHO cells and is composed of two heavy chain (γ1-chain) molecules and two LC (κ-chain) molecules. The two HCs are connected together by two covalent disulfide bonds, while the HC and LC are linked through a single disulfide bond. Burosumab has the typical disulfide bond structure of a human IgG1 with the characteristic disulfide bond pattern. Each HC contains an N-linked oligosaccharide at the canonical glycosylation site at N297.</p><p>Burosumab is a neutralizing antibody against soluble Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23) only. It has recombinant fully human complementarity determining regions (CDRs) derived from mouse anti-human fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) using KM Mouse® technology. Each CDR binds to excess FGF23 secreted in biological fluid. At a cellular level, the FGF23 binds to FGF23 receptor (FGFR1) and Klotho, and then induces the signal pathway through the receptor. Burosumab also has constant regions derived from human IgG1 which are known to extend circulating half-life through binding to the FcRn.</p><p>The mechanisms of action (MoA) of burosumab (also called KRN23) is neutralization of excess FGF23, thus inhibiting an interaction between soluble FGF23 and FGF23 receptor complex on the cell surface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacture, characterisation and process controls</head><p>Manufacturers Burosumab active substance is produced at Kyowa Hakki Kirin Co.Ltd. located in Gunma, Japan.</p><p>During the procedure a pre-authorisation inspection was carried out on 29-05-2017 to 01-06-2017 by the Finnish Medicine Agency (fimea), the Competent Authorities of Finland. On the basis of the inspection it can be confirmed that the operations are in general compliance with the principles and guidelines of good manufacturing practice as laid down in Commission Directive 2003/94/EC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description of the manufacturing process</head><p>Burosumab active substance (AS) commercial manufacturing process constitutes of three main parts: 1) upstream cell culture process, 2) downstream purification process, and 3) filtration and storage. Burosumab AS is filled in bags and shipped from the AS manufacturing site to the FP manufacturing site in the same area of the Takasaki Plant. The shipping method is qualified to keep the AS in a frozen state under the specified temperature range and operating time.</p><p>The media used in the upstream cell culture process do not contain any materials of animal origin and are tested according to in-house requirements. Starting materials used in the preparation of buffers for downstream processing comply with pharmacopoeial requirements or manufacturer's specification, and do not contain any materials of animal origin.</p><p>In general, the burosumab AS manufacturing process and controls are considered to be appropriately described.</p><p>The definition of acceptable ranges in the application has been revised to reflect the univariate process characterization, i.e. variation allowed in not more than one parameter at a time. There is no claim for design space. The proposed definitions are aligned with ICH Q8 and considered acceptable.</p><p>The origin of the nucleotide sequence coding for the protein has been sufficiently described. The steps in the assembly of the expression construct have also been described in detail, as well as the origin of cells and the cell banking system. The characterisation of MCB and WCB has been described in detail and in general comply with requirements laid down in ICH Q5A and Q5D.</p><p>No raw materials of biological origin are used in the AS manufacturing process or in the establishment of the cell banks (the Master Cell Bank <ref type="bibr">[MCB]</ref> and Working Cell Bank <ref type="bibr">[WCB]</ref>). The source of the protein A is a recombinant protein produced in E. coli as the host cell. Protein A is purified with conventional chromatography. The protein A is manufactured free of animal-derived components.</p><p>The information submitted regarding raw materials and reagents is considered to be adequate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Process controls and control strategy</head><p>The commercial process control strategy was proposed after the process characterization (PC) studies and confirmed by the process performance qualification (PPQ). Process control is assured through in-process control (IPC) testing with rejection and/or action limits. In addition, in-process monitoring (IPM) is used for process monitoring and trending purpose with internal alert limits. When a result of an IPC testing does not meet an action, it triggers an investigation in accordance with internal quality management systems and procedures, to determine the potential impact on product quality. IPM and the internal limits as provided in Section 3.2.S.2.4 may be changed under the internal quality system by accumulating and periodically evaluating the relevant data as per the continued process verification (CPV) program.</p><p>Furthermore, risk-based approaches, which included identification of the Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs), and assessment of the criticality of the Performance Attributes (PAs) and the process parameters, were employed during the establishment of the control strategy.</p><p>CQAs identification, PA criticality assessment, process parameter (PP) criticality assessment and material attributes criticality assessment have been reviewed and reassessed based on the acquired knowledge and manufacturing experience and will continue to be updated periodically as part of the commercial lifecycle approach.</p><p>The in-process testing approach and the link to attributes are explained. IPCs with action/rejection limits and IPMs with internal limits are listed for all manufacturing steps, including rationales for selection of in-process testing strategy. Upon request, the Applicant has clarified that a batch that fails to meet rejection limits will be rejected.</p><p>The updated proposal for IPC limits is acceptable, as is the updated control strategy with an extension of the drug substance specification. In the current version, there are less IPC controls (however reasonable inprocess monitoring) and more specification controls. The control strategy is presented, and in-house terms defined in relation to ICH Q8. The use of two terms, CQA and IPQA, with the same meaning makes the structure of the control strategy unnecessary complicated, however the overall meaning of the actual classification of parameters and attributes are agreeable.</p><p>The concept of performance attributes in connection with process consistency is understood, thus the definition of the process performance attribute, PPA, and the criticality levels 'key PPA' and 'non-key PPA', is acceptable. It is noted, however, that there may be cases when it is difficult to conclude if a process parameter has impact on a key performance attribute or slight impact on a critical performance attribute/critical quality attribute.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Process validation</head><p>The control strategy was validated by demonstrating that the results met the PPQ acceptance criteria with the qualified facility, equipment, and utilities. Manufacture of a number of lots of PPQ was proposed to confirm the consistency in terms of product quality and process performance. The process performance qualification of the manufacturing steps for burosumab is considered to be adequately described and reported. The approach for setting PPQ acceptance criteria, tolerance intervals based on a limited number of batches, is not fully supported as use of tolerance intervals requires more data points. However, the actual PPQ results are generally concentrated in quite narrow ranges and the PPQ is, over all, considered approvable.</p><p>In-process pool hold times were studied in full scale during PPQ. The conclusion that there was no significant change in any performance attributes during the hold time is supported.</p><p>Process performance qualifications for media hold, buffer hold, mixing, and uniformity of filled bulk are sufficiently described and the conclusions supported.</p><p>Frozen AS is transported within the same plant for finished product manufacturing. The transport has been qualified to assure that AS is kept frozen and that there are no effects on quality.</p><p>The data submitted in support of the shipping qualification is acceptable.</p><p>Reprocessing in case of technical failure (integrity test failure or facility/equipment failure) for a proposed manufacturing step is briefly described. This approach is acceptable. Small scale data supporting the proposed reprocessing has been submitted, which reveals that there is no significant difference between filtration pool and re-filtration pool regarding the product quality. The conclusion is supported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Process development and characterisation</head><p>The approach to process development and characterization is described, including further identification and classification of critical quality attributes (CQAs) and process performance attributes (IPQAs and PPAs, impurities, product-related substances, general requirements, formulation-related attributes, process consistency attributes).</p><p>The CQAs for the AS were identified based on the assessment of CQAs for the final FP to meet the quality target product profile. The CQAs that must be controlled within an appropriate range during the AS manufacturing stage to ensure the final product maintains desired quality were specified. The CQAs are categorized into five groups:</p><p>Univariate and multivariate experiments were performed during process characterisation, however the manufacturing description is based on a univariate approach (see also the revised definition of acceptable ranges).</p><p>The approach for evaluation of column cleaning and reuse is acceptable and the conclusions that results were equivalent between the start of the small scale studies and after the suggested number of reuse cycles are supported.</p><p>The commercial specification for burosumab AS was established as a part of the overall control strategy to assure the process performance and product quality of the burosumab AS. The proposed commercial specification as part of the overall control strategy of the AS reflects the product knowledge acquired throughout development and focuses on those quality attributes that are the most important to monitor.</p><p>The analytical method descriptions and method validations are considered to be adequate.</p><p>Batch analyses for lots run according to process versions 1 to 4 are provided. All lots were tested to the specification in place at the time of product release. Further batch data regarding attributes not contained in the specifications is included in the dossier. Reasonable lot-to-lot consistency has been demonstrated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reference Standard</head><p>The history of burosumab Reference Standards (RSs) is given. A two-tiered RS system is used which consists of a Primary Reference Standard (PRS) and a Working Reference Standard (WRS) for commercial manufacturing. The PRS and WRS have been collected from the same AS batch. The specification and results of qualification are provided. For qualification of the potency of PRS the previous RS lot SYUA-02 was used as a reference standard. The qualification and further characterization of the PRS is found acceptable.</p><p>Requalification will be conducted annually. Based on the results of the requalification, further use of the PRS may be extended The future establishment and control of future WRS has been outlined and the same specification as required for SYUA-04 will apply. The approach on requalification and WRS as described by the Applicant is considered to be acceptable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability</head><p>The Applicant claims an AS shelf life of 24 months at -40 °C.</p><p>Long-term stability studies at were performed as per the ICH Q1A and Q5C. In addition, stability studies were conducted under elevated and stress conditions to evaluate the effect on the AS quality. The container closure system used to package the stability samples is identical to the commercial FP container closure system.</p><p>For the stability testing, a subset of the AS release testing is performed. Acceptance criteria are based upon the acceptance criteria used for AS release specification, which has been revised from the development phase. Changes seen under elevated and stress conditions demonstrate that the methods selected are stability-indicating.</p><p>Stability data compiled to date confirm that the recommended storage condition is appropriate for long-term storage and that the container closure system is compatible with the AS. Updated stability data that supports an AS shelf life of 24 months at -40 °C has been provided and the claim for 24 months shelf life at -40 °C is supported.</p><p>The ongoing long-term stability studies will be continued by Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. (KHK) through to completion. In case of out of specification results, the Applicant will inform EMA. In addition the Applicant commits to place and test a minimum of one lot of burosumab manufactured at the commercial site per year on the post-approval long-term stability studies at −40 ± 10°C through 36 months.</p><p>The proposal for completion of ongoing long-term stability studies as well as for the first three commercial lots has been accepted.</p><p>The subjects covered by the description of the stability studies, stability data and post-approval stability protocol are appropriate and the chosen analytical methods adequately stability indicating.</p><p>It should be noted that when stability protocols are used for future post-approval process changes, there may be need to extend them beyond the protocols depending on the nature of the change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparability exercise for Active Substance</head><p>An extensive comparability exercise was conducted to link the commercial process (Process 4) to previous versions 1, 2 and 3. The comparability includes release testing, further characterisation, in-process testing and stability testing. The active substance process changes are clearly outlined and well described, however all Process 4 batches are used in ongoing clinical studies. Thus, results and conclusions from the clinical experience of Process 4 material are not available in the dossier. The overall conclusion that processes 1, 2 and 3 can be considered comparable is supported.</p><p>The comparability exercise for Process 3 and Process 4 includes release testing, further characterization, inprocess controls and stability studies. Comparability acceptance criteria for evaluation of process 3 vs process 4 were based on the numerical overlap approach method which was considered to be acceptable as a comparability method.</p><p>The conclusions are acceptable and Process 3 is considered to be comparable to Process 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Finished Medicinal Product</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description of the product and pharmaceutical development</head><p>The finished product (FP) is presented as a solution for injection provided in a 5 mL Type I clear borosilicate tubing glass vial. Crysvita FP contains burosumab as active substance supplied in three strengths; 10 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg. Each vial contains 1 ml of the FP solution.</p><p>Other ingredients are L-histidine, D-sorbitol, Polysorbate 80, L-methionine, Hydrochloric acid, 10% and water for injections.</p><p>The product is available as a 1 ml solution in a clear glass vial with butyl rubber stopper, and aluminium seal.</p><p>The FP formulation does not contain any overages.</p><p>The intended commercial formulation is the same as that used during the pivotal clinical studies. The applicant has satisfactorily addressed comparability between the commercial product and a previous version (process 3), which had also been used in some clinical studies.</p><p>All excipients used for the FP formulation are well-known pharmaceutical excipients, compliant with the requirements of the relevant USP, Ph.Eur. and JP monographs and there are no novel excipients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmaceutical development</head><p>The pharmaceutical development has been detailed and acceptably described. The excipients used in the FP formulation were selected based on prior development experience on other monoclonal antibodies (mABs) developed by Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. An extensive formulation development was performed and the chosen formulation has been adequately justified. The manufacturing development has been described in detail and discussed including the identification of the CQA and design of control strategy. The Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) were identified based on the Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP), regulatory requirements, and knowledge gained during the development.</p><p>Performance Attributes (PAs) are classified into In-Process Quality Attributes (IPQAs) and Process Performance Attributes (PPAs). As commented above on drug substance the definition IPQA (performance attribute directly linked to a CQA) it has been clarified that there is no difference between IPQA and CQA.</p><p>A comprehensive process characterisation was performed and adequately summarized in the dossier. The impact of process parameters (PPs) on each performance attribute in the manufacturing process was evaluated to understand the manufacturing process, to define criticality of PPs, and to support the establishment of the acceptable range of PPs in each process step. The proposed critical and key process parameters and their acceptable ranges to be used in process performance qualification (PPQ) manufacturing were given.</p><p>The FP manufacturing change history has been acceptably described and changes throughout the development satisfactorily justified. All FP batches were manufactured at Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. (KHK), Takasaki Plant, located in Gunma, Japan.</p><p>A comparability evaluation was performed between FP manufactured with AS derived from process 3 and process 4.This is found acceptable and based on the comparison it is agreed that the data from process 3 and 4 can be considered comparable.</p><p>The suitability of the primary packaging and secondary packaging has also been adequately addressed. The vial and stopper complies with Ph.Eur.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacture of the product and process controls</head><p>The active substance and finished product is manufactured at Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Takasaki Gunma, Japan.</p><p>The manufacturing process consists of thawing of the AS, formulation, bulk filtration (0.22 μm), sterile filtration, aseptic filling into vials, stoppering, capping, visual inspection, labelling and packaging. No reprocessing is applied for. The manufacturing process and the controls of critical steps are sufficiently described. During the procedure information on the shipping conditions for the vials to the labelling and packaging facility was added to the description of the manufacturing process.</p><p>The manufacturing process and control strategy for the FP were proposed based on prior knowledge and PC studies. The process parameters as well as the IPCs and their proposed ranges are found adequate and acceptably justified by the PC studies and the PPQ activities.</p><p>The process validation approach is satisfactorily described and considered acceptable. In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that the critical process parameters are well controlled, and that the finished product can be manufactured to the intended quality and with sufficient consistency and reproducibility. Also each processing time has been satisfactorily justified by the processing time establishment study. The in-process controls are considered to be adequate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Product specification</head><p>The finished product release and shelf life specifications have been provided.</p><p>Both release and shelf life criteria in the final product specification include appropriate tests.</p><p>The specification was established based on FP batches which are representative of the commercial process.</p><p>The rationale for not including some of the quality attributes in the release specification as well as shelf life specification has been addressed. For establishment of the specification limits the tolerance interval approach was initially used. Although this approach may be acceptable from a process and analytical capability point of view in case of adequate number of batches, the acceptance criteria for attributes of relevance for the safety and efficacy should be within the range of clinical experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impurities</head><p>The control of product-related impurities in FP is found acceptably addressed with the updated specification provided during the procedure and it can be concluded that the levels of impurities are in the same range as for AS and do not increased during manufacture.</p><p>Characterization of sub-visible particles was performed using two methods Light Obscuration (LO) and Micro Flow Imaging (MFI). This was accepted.</p><p>A risk assessment followed by a characterization of elemental impurities was performed. Since no high-risk sources were identified through the risk assessment Class 1, Class 2A and Class 3 elements required by the ICH Q3D guideline to assess for a parenteral product were evaluated.</p><p>All results for elemental impurities were below the limit of detection and it is agreed that no elemental impurities of toxicological concern have been identified and consequently no need for additional controls.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparability exercise for finished medicinal drug product</head><p>During the course of the manufacturing process development, four processes have been used to manufacture the FP lots. All FP batches were manufactured at Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. (KHK), Takasaki Plant, located in Gunma, Japan. Process 1 to Process 3 was used for clinical trial. Process 4 was developed for clinical and commercial. However, these clinical trials are on-going and not yet evaluated. Thus, results from the clinical experience of Process 4 material are not available in the dossier. Process 2 to 4 uses the same formulation.</p><p>From process 3 to 4 five modifications were introduced which for example includes a new facility, scale up and introduction of the 20 mg/ml strength.</p><p>A comparability evaluation was performed between finished product manufactured with AS from process 3 (batches used in clinical trials) and process 4 (commercial batches and batches used in ongoing clinical trials).

There are no excipients of human or animal origin in the FP.</p><p>The strategy with regards to adventitious agent safety relies on several measures such as control of raw materials, safety testing performed on the MCB, WCB, and cells at the limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA), IPC testing of unprocessed bulk and virus validation studies performed on a down scaling model of the manufacturing process(clearance studies).</p><p>The testing performed on the MCB, WCB, and cells at the limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA) was performed in accordance with the ICH Guidelines Q5A and Q5D. As expected for CHO-cells, Intracytoplasmic A-type particles and C-type retrovirus particles were found. This is of no safety concern since both MCB and LIVCA cells were negative for retrovirus activity.</p><p>The in-process samples of the unprocessed bulk harvest are controlled for low bioburden, for absence of mycoplasma, in vitro detection of adventitious agents (MRC-5, Vero and CHO K1 cells), and qPCR of Minute Virus of Mice (MVM).</p><p>The viral clearance studies have been performed in accordance with CPMP/BWP/268/95 and ICH Q5A. Worst case settings have been applied for several parameters during the clearance studies to demonstrate robustness of virus reduction.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Pharmacology</head><p>KRN23 (burosumab) is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody against fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). In a Biacore competitive binding study it was shown to bind with similar binding affinity (K D~1 0 -11 M) to human, cynomolgus monkey and rabbit FGF23. KRN23 shows no binding to mouse, rat or dog FGF23.</p><p>In a cell-based assay, KRN inhibited FGF23 signalling with human, monkey and rabbit FGF23 but not with mouse or rat FGF23.</p><p>Biacore studies showed that the KRN23/FGF23 complex could bind to Klotho. It is postulated that KRN23 binds to the FGFR-binding N-terminal domain of FGF23, while the C-terminal domain binds Klotho.</p><p>KRN23 increased serum phosphate and 1,25(OH) 2 D levels, and decreased urinary phosphate and Ca levels in rabbits given a single IV dose of 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg of KRN23. Increases in creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were observed in animals given 30 mg/kg, and the subsequent mortalities/unscheduled euthanasia of 3 animals (30 mg/kg) were attributed to acute renal failure thought to be caused by nephrocalcinosis. These findings occurred in animals that had elevated serum phosphate levels exceeding normal limits, ranging from 8 to 39 mg/dL.</p><p>In adult monkeys, significant increases in serum phosphate, tubular maximal reabsorption of phosphate per glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR) and serum 1,25(OH)2D levels were observed after single IV doses of KRN23. The minimum effective dose of KRN23 for increases in serum phosphate and 1,25(OH)2D levels was estimated to be 0.1 mg/kg and 0.03 mg/kg, respectively, following a single IV dose given to adult monkeys.</p><p>The PK/PD effect of KRN23 was evaluated after intermittent SC administration of 1 mg/kg for 13 weeks (once every 2 weeks) in adult and juvenile monkeys. Serum phosphate elevations were slightly higher in juvenile animals compared to that in adults, were similar after repeated dosing, and returned to pre-treatment levels after a recovery period. KRN23 treatment resulted in increased FGF23 levels, both total FGF23 and free FGF23.</p><p>The Hyp mouse is a murine homologue of XLH with a deletion in the 3′ region of the Phex <ref type="figure">(</ref> Safety pharmacology studies were not performed in separate studies, but safety pharmacology parameters (respiratory rate, ECG, blood pressure and cardiac function) were assessed in 14-and 40-</p><p>week repeat-dose toxicity studies in adult and juvenile cynomolgus monkeys, at doses ranging from 0.03 to 30 mg/kg. There were no effects on blood pressure or respiratory rate in any of the studies. No ECG effects were observed in the 14-week study or in the 40-week study in juvenile monkeys. In the 40-week study in adult monkeys, increased heart rate was observed from Week 13 in males administered 30 mg/kg. One male showed an abnormal wave form (depressed ST) on ECG at Week 39. Cardiac function (measured in recovery animals only) showed low left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, low stroke volumes and/or ejection fractions in males treated at 30 mg/kg.</p><p>Histopathology revealed myocardial degeneration in these animals. This was associated with ectopic mineralization of the myofibers, correlated with hyperphosphataemia (for further discussion, see the Toxicology section).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Pharmacokinetics</head><p>The concentration of KRN23 in rabbit and cynomolgus serum was determined by a chemiluminescence immunoassay format using two types of anti-KRN23 antibodies. Anti-KRN23 antibodies in cynomolgus monkey serum were determined by a bridging ELISA format, in which anti-KRN23 antibodies were captured with KRN23 adsorbed to the wells of a 96-well microplate and detected with biotin conjugated KRN23.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined after single dose in cynomolgus monkeys and rabbits. In cynomolgus monkeys, the maximum concentration (C max ) and AUC 0-∞ increased in a dose proportional manner between 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg and half-life (t 1/2 ) ranged from 102 to 172 hours.</p><p>Multiple dose pharmacokinetics was studied in rabbits and monkeys as part of the toxicity studies. In cynomolgus monkeys given KRN23 once every 2 weeks at 0.03, 0.3, 3, and 30 mg/kg for 14 or 40 weeks, the AUC 0-∞ increased in a dose-dependent manner and other pharmacokinetic parameters showed no obvious differences between dose levels after the first dose indicating that the pharmacokinetic profile of KRN23 after the first dosing was linear from 0.03 to 30 mg/kg. The AUC and C max after the first and final dosing were comparable, and thus, no significant accumulation was observed from 0.03 to 30 mg/kg.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Toxicology</head><p>The toxicological profile of burosumab (KRN23) was characterized in rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys via single-dose IV (rabbit) injection, and via repeat-dose IV (both species) injection/infusion and SC (cynomolgus) injection. The choice of toxicology species was based on in vitro binding affinity data to FGF23.</p><p>For the longer term (40 week) studies, only the cynomolgus monkey was used, which is acceptable based on the comparable toxicity profile in rabbits and monkeys.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Single dose toxicity</head><p>A single IV dose of 3 mg/kg caused the death of one male rabbit on Day 6. Histopathological evaluation showed ectopic mineralization in multiple organs (e.g kidney and heart), thrombus formation in the atrium, perivascular edema in the heart, lung edema, increased bone resorption, periosteal fibrosis, and bone marrow necrosis. Cause of death was considered due to a combination of renal failure, vascular mineralization in the heart, and gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances as a consequence of mineralization in the GI tract.</p><p>Surviving animals at 3 mg/kg (terminally evaluated on Days 14 or 35) showed decreased food consumption and body weight, proteinuria, decreased excretion of sodium and chloride in the urine, lower albumin/globulin ratio, increased -globulin, decreased chloride, albumin and ALP, and decreased RBC, haematocrit and hemoglobin. Histopathological evaluation showed mineralization of the aorta, kidney, lung and stomach, sometimes associated with multinucleated giant cells (foreign body reaction). In the kidney, perivascular fibrosis, tubular basophila, dilatation and regeneration occurred in association with mineralization.</p><p>Serum inorganic phosphate and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D were elevated at &gt; 0.3 mg/kg. Mortality and ectopic mineralization occurred at mean serum phosphate levels &gt; 8.6 mg/dL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeat-dose toxicity</head><p>In repeat-dose toxicity studies in rabbits up to 14 weeks, and in adult and juvenile cynomolgus monkeys up to 40 weeks, a spectrum of effects related to the primary pharmacology of burosumab was observed. These effects were consistent with an exaggerated response to the inhibition of normal FGF23 levels resulting in a supraphysiologic increase in serum phosphate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mortalities</head><p>In the 14-week rabbit study, one male dosed at 3 mg/kg IV was found dead on Day 6. Histopathology showed mineralization in multiple organs, myocardial degeneration and necrosis, lung edema, and periosteal fibrosis and osteoclast proliferation. Cause of death was considered due to renal failure secondary to nephrocalcinosis, with mineralization in the heart and lung as contributory factors. This animal had a peak serum phosphate level of 14.84 mg/dL.</p><p>In the 40-week study in adult monkeys, one male animal was euthanized at Week 31 due to abnormal gait and lateral position, which correlated with ectopic mineralization in the limbs.</p><p>In the 40-week study in juvenile monkeys, one male and one female dosed at 3 mg/kg IV were found dead and white nodules in the lung and liver, were observed. Histopathological evaluation showed parasitic granuloma and inflammation in the liver and lungs, and stress-related changes in the adrenal gland and thymus. The Applicant considered the moribundity to be caused by a parasite infection and unrelated to drug treatment.</p><p>The Applicant was asked to provide further justification for dismissing these three preterminal mortalities in high dose juvenile monkeys as incidental. In their response, the Applicant submitted literature references describing cases of spontaneous tympanites in laboratory monkeys. It appears to be a similar condition that caused the death of the two monkeys treated at 3 mg/kg IV. The etiology seems to be multifactorial, with stress as a major contributory factor. While the incidence of tympanites in the juvenile study is clearly above the historical control range at the test laboratory, there is no obvious link to burosumab treatment in the sense that other monkeys treated at the same dose level did not show any gastrointestinal disturbances, and the two monkeys that died showed comparable burosumab-related changes as other animals treated at 3 mg/kg IV.</p><p>Regarding the third monkey, treated at 3 mg/kg SC, the Applicant argues that tympanites was not a primary effect but rather the consequence of a severe parasite infection. The Applicant attributes the fluid accumulation in the chest cavity, abdomen and subcutis to hypoalbuminaemia, secondary to liver injury caused by parasite infection and inflammation. This seems plausible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ectopic mineralization</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rabbits</head><p>In rabbits treated with burosumab at 3 mg/kg IV injection, once every second week for 14 weeks, mineralization was observed in the aorta, heart, kidney and stomach. Multinucleated giant cells were sometimes present in association with the mineral deposits. In the kidney, mineralization was associated with Assessment report EMA/148319/2018 Page 27/130 tubular regeneration and interstitial fibrosis. Serum 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and inorganic phosphate were elevated at &gt; 0.03 mg/kg and &gt; 0.3 mg/kg, respectively. Ectopic mineralization occurred at peak serum phosphate levels &gt; 8.5 mg/dL (phosphate levels in vehicle-treated controls were 6.2-6.4 mg/dL).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adult monkeys</head><p>In adult monkeys treated with burosumab at &gt; 3 mg/kg IV infusion, every second week for 14 weeks, mineralization occurred at multiple sites (kidney, lung, choroid plexus, heart, aorta, eye, stomach and other tissues). One male at 30 mg/kg had a swollen forepaw due to mineralization in tendons and tendon sheaths, and a tracheal mass due to calcinosis circumscripta. Mineralization in the kidney was associated with tubular degeneration/regeneration, multinucleated giant cells, and fibrosis, at 30 mg/kg. Elevated phosphorus excretion in the urine at 30 mg/kg was possibly related to the renal mineralization. Ectopic mineralization occurred at peak mean serum phosphate levels &gt; 11 mg/dL (phosphate levels in vehicle-treated controls ranged from 5.2-7.7 mg/dL). Serum 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and inorganic phosphate were elevated at &gt; 0.03 mg/kg and &gt; 0.3 mg/kg, respectively.</p><p>In the 40-week study, one male at 30 mg/kg IV (administered every second week) was euthanized preterminally at Week 31, due to ectopic mineralization in the limbs (subcutis, skeletal muscle, joint capsules, ligaments) causing abnormal gait and swelling. Other males at 30 mg/kg IV or SC also showed abnormal gait and swelling of limbs, correlating with x-ray findings of accumulated material along the bones, and ectopic mineralization.</p><p>Ectopic mineralization in subcutaneous tissues and skeletal muscle was observed at &gt; 0.3 mg/kg in males and at 30 mg/kg in females. At &gt; 3 mg/kg, mineralization was present in multiple tissues (kidney, testis, lung, trachea). In many animals, the mineral deposits were large enough to be visible at necropsy in the form of white masses. At the highest dose, 30 mg/kg, there was widespread mineralization involving the heart, aorta, eye, liver, spinal cord, urinary bladder, sciatic nerve and stomach.</p><p>Serum 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and inorganic phosphate were elevated at &gt; 0.03 mg/kg and &gt; 0.3 mg/kg, respectively. The peak mean serum phosphate level at 0.3 mg/kg, the lowest dose where mineralization occurred, was 7.5 mg/dL (males). At the high dose (30 mg/kg), the peak mean serum phosphate level was &gt; 11 mg/dL. In comparison, the mean range in vehicle control animals was 3.0 -4.7 mg/dL. Increased excretion of inorganic phosphorus in the urine at 30 mg/kg was possibly related to renal mineralization.</p><p>Mineralization in the kidney was associated with tubular degeneration/necrosis and regeneration, multinucleated epithelium, interstitial fibrosis, and inflammation, mainly at 30 mg/kg. Increased kidney weight and changes in clinical pathology such as a positive occult blood reaction in urine, and increased protein, glucose and sodium excretion in urine, and increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, were probably related to these findings.</p><p>Mineralization in the heart at 30 mg/kg IV and SC was associated with increased heart rate in males from</p><p>Week 13, and an abnormal wave form (depressed ST) on ECG in one male at Week 39. Furthermore, males dosed at 30 mg/kg showed low left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, low stroke volumes, and/or low ejection fractions at the end of the recovery period. This was most likely related to mineralization of myofibers/blood vessels in the heart, and/or tunica media in the aorta. Overall, ectopic mineralization with associated changes was more severe in males than in females; however, there was no clear sex difference in exposure to burosumab. The incidence and severity of treatment-related changes were similar in the 30 mg/kg IV and SC groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Juvenile monkeys</head><p>In a 40-week study on juvenile monkeys (6-7 months old), using the same study design as in the adult 40-</p><p>week study but with a lower high dose, there were three preterminal mortalities at the highest dose level (3 mg/kg) (see above). Swelling of the forepaw or hindpaw was noted at 3 mg/kg in a few males, correlating with x-ray findings of accumulated material along the digits. A white mass in the subcutis of the swollen digits was observed at necropsy in one of these males, being correlated at the microscopic level with mineralization.</p><p>Ectopic mineralization in multiple tissues (kidney, lung, skeletal muscle, submandibular gland, eye) occurred at 3 mg/kg IV and SC. Mineralization in the kidney was not associated with tubular degeneration or inflammation. Elevated urine creatinine, calcium, sodium, potassium and chloride excretion in some animals were possibly related to the renal mineralization.</p><p>Serum 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and inorganic phosphate were elevated at &gt; 0.03 mg/kg. Ectopic mineralization occurred at peak mean serum phosphate levels of 10 mg/dL(mean phosphate levels in vehicle-treated controls were in the range of 5.2-7.8 mg/dL).</p><p>The Applicant was asked to discuss whether juvenile monkeys might be more sensitive to ectopic mineralization than adult monkeys. In their response, the Applicant presented data showing higher baseline phosphate levels in juveniles and more pronounced mineralization in adults at phosphate levels &gt; 10.5 mg/dL It was concluded that adult monkeys were more sensitive than juveniles to elevations in serum phosphate. This seems logic considering the higher need/turnover of phosphate for skeletal growth in juveniles. Despite a somewhat lower exposure to burosumab in juvenile monkeys at 3 mg/kg, the peak serum phosphate levels were comparable or slightly higher in juveniles as compared with adults treated at 3 mg/kg. Taken together, the data presented by the Applicant does not suggest that juvenile animals (and, by extrapolation, the paediatric population) would be more sensitive to ectopic mineralization than adults.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects on bone</head><p>In the 14-week rabbit study, the preterminally dead male at 3 mg/kg showed periosteal fibrosis and osteoclast proliferation. Serum calcium was decreased in this animal.</p><p>In the 14-week cynomolgus monkey study, one male at 30 mg/kg showed visible swelling of the femur and humerus, which correlated with x-ray findings of calcification deposits along the bones as well as periosteal hyperostosis observed at the microscopic level. Bone-specific ALP in serum was decreased in monkeys dosed at &gt; 0.3 mg/kg, while osteocalcin (marker for bone formation), cross-linked C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx; marker for bone resorption), and calcium, were increased at &gt; 3 mg/kg.</p><p>In the 40-week study on adult monkeys, in addition to ectopic mineralization along the bones, there was a and decreased density in the cortical bone, of males at 30 mg/kg. In contrast, females at 30 mg/kg showed increased total and cortical bone density. Ostecalcin and CTx were increased at &gt; 0.3 mg/kg in males, and at higher doses in females. There was a transient (early) calcium increase in both sexes at 30 mg/kg. Bonespecific ALP was decreased in females, but increased in one male, at 30 mg/kg.</p><p>In the 40-week study on juvenile monkeys, histopathological evaluation showed increased numbers of osteoclasts and increased bone resorption in the femur of a few animals treated at 3 mg/kg. One of these (a female) showed an increase in osteoblasts as well. pQCT evaluation showed increased total bone density and thickness of cortical bone in females at &gt; 0.03 mg/kg IV, in males at &gt; 0.3 mg/kg IV, and in both sexes at 3 mg/kg SC. Histomorphometry revealed decreased osteoid thickness, volume and/or surface in one male at 3 mg/kg IV, while at 3 mg/kg SC one male showed increased and another one decreased osteoid thickness.</p><p>There were no effects on bone length or strength in juvenile monkeys. Osteocalcin and CTx were increased at &gt; 0.3 mg/kg IV and at 3 mg/kg SC. Bone-specific ALP was decreased in males at &gt; 0.3 mg/kg and in both sexes at 3 mg/kg IV and SC. Despite slightly lower exposure in juvenile versus adult monkeys at 3 mg/kg, effects on bone were more pronounced in juveniles at this dose level.</p><p>The Applicant was asked to provide a clarifying discussion of the bone findings, with emphasis on their clinical relevance. In their response, the Applicant suggested that some of the differences between adult and juvenile animals may be due to the skeletal growth state of juveniles. This seems plausible. It is also agreed that the bone effects appear to be driven by excessive serum phosphate levels, causing increased bone turnover or formation. Based on the data presented, juvenile animals do not appear to be more sensitive to bone toxicity than adult animals. There was no effect on bone length or strength in juvenile monkeys. The Applicant proposed a text for section 5.3 which is acceptable, with a minor revision (see separate SmPC document).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reversibility</head><p>Reversibility was not evaluated in rabbits. In the cynomolgus monkey 14-week study, all changes were fully or partially reversible except low bone-specific ALP in males, increased osteocalcin and CTx in females, and ectopic mineralization in the aorta at the base of the heart. In the monkey 40-week adult study, the following changes did not show reversibility: x-ray, gross and histopathological findings in the long bones;</p><p>histopathological findings in the aorta, kidney, lung, heart, eye, sciatic nerve and trachea; changes in pQCT, and bone strength, and organ weight changes (adrenal gland, kidney) in females.

In all monkeys with ADA, serum concentrations of burosumab were diminished and increases in serum inorganic phosphate and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D were also attenuated. No ADA were detected in the 40-week juvenile monkey study. In the ePPND study in pregnant monkeys, ADA were detected in 2 dams during the lactation period, without any effects on exposure or serum levels of inorganic phosphate and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D.</p><p>Immunogenicity is included as an Important potential risk in the RMP, and is included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. From a non-clinical point of view, no further action is considered needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other treatment-related effects</head><p>Decreased food consumption and body weight were observed in rabbits at 3 mg/kg, and in adult monkeys at Increased leukocytes and neutrophils in rabbits at 3 mg/kg, and in adult monkeys at &gt; 3 mg/kg, may have been associated with inflammation secondary to mineralization in various tissues, although in monkeys this was not clearly described in the pathology report. It is possible that increased PT and APTT in adult male monkeys at &gt; 3 mg/kg also were related to inflammation.</p><p>Decreased number of lymphocytes in the germinal centers of the spleen, and increased adrenal gland weight, in adult monkeys treated at 30 mg/kg, are most likely stress-related changes.</p><p>Some effects on red blood cells in rabbits and monkeys were observed. Decreased haematocrit and haemoglobin was present in male rabbits at 3 mg/kg, and in male monkeys at 30 mg/kg (14-week study). In the 40-week adult monkey study, decreased haematocrit, haemoglobin, erythrocyte count, MCV and MCH were observed in males at &gt; 3 mg/kg, and in both sexes at 30 mg/kg IV and SC. Similar effects were also noted in dams and fetuses/offspring in the ePPND study. The mechanism behind the observed effects is unclear; however, the changes were of small magnitude and anaemia has not been observed in XLH patients treated with burosumab.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Toxicokinetics and exposure margins</head><p>Exposure to burosumab in monkeys increased with dose, but was not dose-proportional. There was no gender difference in exposure. Slight accumulation was observed in the 14-week, but not in the 40-week, adult monkey study. The T 1/2 was 188-285 hrs on Day 85 in adult monkeys. Exposure in juvenile monkeys was slightly lower than in adult monkeys in the dose range 0.03-3 mg/kg.</p><p>Plasma exposure (AUC) achieved in the repeat-dose toxicity study in adult cynomolgus monkeys exceeded the human therapeutic exposure by at least 24-fold. Exposure margins at the NOAELs in the two monkey studies were below clinical therapeutic exposure. Since the adverse effects are linked to serum phosphate levels and thus can be monitorable in the clinic, the lack of margins is not considered to be a crucial issue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity</head><p>Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies are generally not appropriate for biotechnology-derived monoclonal antibodies such as burosumab. No genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies have been conducted by the Applicant; this is endorsed. The Applicant has submitted a carcinogenicity risk assessment document, summarizing and discussing relevant literature data, as well as data from in house toxicology studies.</p><p>Published literature on humans with a genetic deficiency of FGF23, and on knockout mice, shows that the effects of complete antagonism of FGF23 do not raise concerns about carcinogenicity. Effects observed in general toxicology studies conducted in rabbits and monkeys are consistent with the pharmacology of burosumab. Increases in osteoclasts and osteoblasts were noted in some animals; however, these findings were not consistent across studies, they were graded from very slight to slight, and since serum phosphorus is a correlating biomarker that will be monitored in the clinic these findings are not considered to present any risk with regard to carcinogenicity. Overall, it is agreed that the carcinogenicity risk of burosumab appears to be low.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reproductive and developmental toxicity</head><p>Fertility and early embryonic development No dedicated studies on fertility and early embryonic development were conducted. In the repeat-dose toxicity studies on cynomolgus monkeys, no adverse effects on female reproductive organs or changes in menstrual cycle were observed. Mineralization of the testes (rete testis/seminiferous tubules) was observed in males at 3 mg/kg, corresponding to an AUC exposure 8-fold above the clinical exposure. No changes were seen in semen analysis. The risk for mineralization of the testes and potential associated adverse effects on fertility is proposed to be handled via monitoring of serum phosphate. This is acceptable.</p><p>Embryofetal development and prenatal/postnatal development The Applicant conducted an enhanced pre/post-natal development (ePPND) study in cynomolgus monkeys, evaluating the effects of dosing from the start of organogenesis (GD20) to late 3rd trimester. Burosumab was administered IV once every second week to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, from GD 20 to delivery. Six and 4 dams in the 0 and 30 mg/kg groups, respectively, were caesarean sectioned and necropsied on GD133, and the fetuses were also evaluated. The remaining dams delivered offspring naturally, and the dams and their offspring were observed and evaluated until weaning (approximately 6 months after delivery) and PND 360, respectively.</p><p>Dams showed increased serum phosphate and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D levels at &gt; 0.3 mg/kg, with associated ectopic mineralization in multiple tissues at &gt; 3 mg/kg. Increased osteocalcin and CTx were observed at &gt; 0.3 mg/kg. At 30 mg/kg, pQCT showed increased total bone content and density. Hematology showed decreased haemoglobin, haematocrit, MCV and MCH. Ectopic mineralization was observed at necropsy on GD133, as well as at the end of the 6-month lactation period. Overall, findings related to exaggerated pharmacology of burosumab were similar in pregnant and non-pregnant cynomolgus monkeys.</p><p>The incidence of abortions and embryo/fetal death at 30 mg/kg was slightly increased as compared with vehicle-treated controls. Due to the high spontaneous background incidence of early and late pregnancy loss in cynomolgus monkeys, this finding was considered equivocal in relation to treatment with burosumab.</p><p>There was a dose-related shortening of the gestation period at &gt; 0.3 mg/kg, which was associated with a non-dose related increase in premature births (incidence 0%, 11.1%, 18.7% and 12.5% at control, low, mid and high dose, respectively). Two out of 7 premature offspring died (on PND0 and 1, respectively).</p><p>In fetuses at 30 mg/kg, delivered by caesarean section on GD133, higher placental weight and placental mineralization were observed. There was no ectopic mineralization in fetal tissues; however, mineral substances were observed in the lung alveoli, probably due to increased inorganic phosphate level in the amniotic fluid. Hematology showed decreased haemoglobin, haematocrit, erythrocyte count and MCV. Serum inorganic phosphate was increased, and bone-specific ALP decreased. pQCT showed increased cortical bone density in the 30 mg/kg group. No external, visceral or skeletal abnormalities were observed.</p><p>In naturally born offspring, the only observed effects were low haemoglobin on PND63 and increased serum Due to the presence of shorter gestation length and increased incidence of premature births at 0.3 mg/kg as compared with vehicle-treated controls there is no NOAEL for female reproductive toxicity in the ePPND study. The Applicant's proposed NOAEL at 3 mg/kg for pre-and postnatal development in fetuses and offspring is agreed with. It is also agreed that burosumab did not induce teratogenicity in monkeys up to a dose of 30 mg/kg.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Local tolerance</head><p>Local tolerance was assessed within the 40-week toxicology studies. No gross or histopathological abnormalities were observed at the IV infusion sites or SC injection sites in adult or juvenile cynomolgus monkeys. In contrast, injection site reactions were commonly observed in the clinical trials with burosumab and are listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other toxicity studies</head><p>Tissue cross-reactivity study of burosumab in normal cynomolgus monkey, rabbit and human tissues FITCconjugated burosumab was applied to cryosections at concentrations of 0.5 μg/mL or 2.5 μg/mL. FGF23 knock-in mouse spleen (positive control) showed cytoplasmic staining of very rare cells at both concentrations. No specific binding was identified in any of the cryosections from rabbit, monkey or human tissues. Since some expression of FGF23 in normal tissues (especially the kidney) would be expected, the absence of staining indicates that the immunohistochemical method used was not sensitive enough to detect low levels of FGF23. The results of this study are not considered conclusive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Influences of anti-FGF23 antibody in wild-type and Hyp mice</head><p>A murine anti-FGF23 antibody at doses of 0, 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg was administered by SC injection twice a</p><p>week for 2 weeks, or as a single dose, to male wild-type (WT) mice (C57BL/6J) and male hypophosphatemic (Hyp) mice (B6.Cg-PhexHyp/J). The Hyp mouse is considered to be a relevant animal model of human XLH.</p><p>The results showed lower baseline serum inorganic phosphate levels in Hyp mice, and a less pronounced increase following anti-FGF23 treatment as compared to WT mice. There was less ectopic mineralization in Hyp mice as compared to WT mice at comparable dose levels, and the incidence and severity of mineralization were related to the level and duration of increased serum inorganic phosphate. Bone growth was improved in Hyp mice by the effects of anti-FGF23 antibody treatment.</p><p>The results of this study support the Applicant's contention that the risk of hyperphosphataemia and its associated sequelae of tissue mineralization is less in a hypophosphatemic disease state, such as in XLH patients. However, a deficiency of this study is the lack of toxicokinetic data. The results would have been more convincing if it could have been shown that burosumab at a similar exposure level induced less increase in serum phosphate, and less ectopic mineralization, in the hypophosphatemic mice as compared to wildtype controls.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.4.">Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment</head><p>According to the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2), the environmental risk assessment for proteins may consist of a justification for not submitting ERA studies as they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. As the active substance burosumab is a monoclonal antibody, it is not expected to pose a risk Assessment report EMA/148319/2018 Page 33/130 to the environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.5.">Discussion on non-clinical aspects Pharmacology</head><p>Biacore studies showed that the KRN23/FGF23 complex could bind to Klotho. It is postulated that KRN23</p><p>(burosumab) binds to the FGFR-binding N-terminal domain of FGF23, while the C-terminal domain binds</p><p>Klotho. Burosumab is an IgG1 antibody which could exhibit effector functions such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). While FGF23 is a soluble protein, Klotho is expressed on the cell surface and the demonstration that burosumab may bind to the complex of FGF23 and Klotho suggests a potential for antibody-mediated cytotoxicity to Klotho expressing cells. The</p><p>Applicant was asked to discuss this issue. In their response, the Applicant confirmed that burosumab may induce ADCC activity on Klotho-expressing cells in vitro, in the presence of FGF23. This activity was shown with cells expressing Klotho at supraphysiological levels. Published data suggests that the highest Klotho expresson is seen in the kidney. In absence of any evidence for a cytotoxic activity in the kidney in nonclinical toxicity studies or in patients, it is concluded that ADCC is unlikely to be a safety concern.</p><p>In the 13 week GLP PD study (sbl303-116) in adult and juvenile monkeys, total and unbound FGF23</p><p>increased after a single intravenous dose in adult and juvenile monkeys. An increase in free FGF was also recorded in the clinical trials with burosumab. The Applicant was asked to provide clarification of these results based on non-clinical data and the proposed mechanism of action. In their response, the Applicant suggested that the increased levels of FGF23 might be due to the dissociation of FGF23 from the burosumab/FGF23 complex in vitro (during the assay). Alternatively, elevations in total FGF23 could also be due to an increased secretion of FGF23 in vivo, as a compensatory response to the elevation of serum phosphate caused by the inhibition of FGF23 activity following burosumab administration. In any case, the increase in total or unbound FGF23 does not appear to be biologically relevant or represent a cause for concern as a subsequent decrease in serum phosphate was not evident in monkeys or humans.</p><p>The product is intended for treatment of patients with excess levels of FGF23. From a theoretical viewpoint, it would not be the goal to completely block the activity of FGF23, but rather to limit the activity to a level in line with physiological level and this needs to be considered in the clinical situation. Section 4.2 in the SmPC points out the need for monitoring and dose adjustment based on phosphate levels. The appropriateness and sufficiency of these measures are discussed in the clinical assessment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacokinetics</head><p>The methods of analysis for toxicokinetic analysis are adequate and validation reports have been submitted.</p><p>However, for some of the pivotal toxicology studies, the method used for toxicokinetic evaluation lacked formal GLP compliant validation. GLP compliance is expected for toxicokinetic data from pivotal toxicology studies. The method in Study AL-4116-G, which was used in all cynomolgus toxicology studies except the 14</p><p>week repeat dose toxicity study, lacked formal GLP compliant validation. The Applicant clarified that this method was similar to the GLP method 6691-177 and that quality assurance was performed in compliance with Japanese law. There were no important differences in exposure data between the cynomolgus studies using the AL-4116-G method and the 6691-177 method, showing that the methods behaved in a similar way.</p><p>It is concluded that toxicokinetics data from the cynomolgus toxicity studies are reliable and can support the safety evaluation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Toxicology</head><p>The main toxicological effect observed in the non-clinical studies was ectopic mineralization. The Applicant has provided an integrated assessment document concerning the risk of ectopic mineralization in patients.</p><p>Correlation analyses show that the development of tissue mineralization in animals appears to be driven primarily by serum phosphate levels during treatment with burosumab. In general, supraphysiological serum phosphate levels exceeding 8 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) were associated with ectopic mineralization in rabbits and monkeys. Reversibility of mineralization was observed in some, but far from all, cases. Patients with XLH have serum phosphate levels &lt; 2.8 mg/dL (normal range in humans: 3.2-6.1 mg/dL) and the target for treatment with burosumab is 5 mg /dL. No patient in the clinical trials had a serum phosphate level above 5 mg/dL (see further the Clinical Assessment Report). Based on the animal data, a 40% increase above the target phosphate level of 5 mg/dL would be needed to cause ectopic mineralization.</p><p>The risk of mineralization during clinical use is expected to be lower due to presence of excess FGF23 in patients, and manageable through monitoring and maintenance of normal phosphate and calcium levels.</p><p>Hyperphosphataemia and ectopic mineralizaion are included as Important potential risks in the RMP. The risk for renal and cardiac mineralization in particular is proposed to be monitored via imaging. On the whole, the Applicant's discussion and risk assessment of ectopic mineralization can be accepted. The risk of an adverse reproductive outcome cannot be completely ruled out. The incidence of combined abortions/embryo-fetal deaths for GD20 to delivery or cesarean section on GD133 in the 30 mg/kg group was higher than the maximum for the control background dataset; this difference was only apparent when satellite animals were included. The incidence of premature births was higher at 3 mg/kg when compared to that observed in historical controls; this was not dose-related; the relationship to treatment is not certain. Any changes in bone and phosphate metabolism in the fetus are likely related to changes in maternal phosphate levels and subsequently, the active placental transport of phosphate to the fetus, rather than via a FGF23-related mechanism.</p><p>While effects on reproductive function occurred at exposures similar to those proposed clinically, it is acknowledged that exposure-based safety margins are less useful for informing risk to XLH patients since the toxicology studies were conducted in normal animals which are overly sensitive to changes in serum phosphate than XLH patients and that reproductive and developmental risk is expected to be best managed by maintaining appropriate phosphate levels.</p><p>The SmPC therefore advises against the use of burosumab in pregnant women and women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception. However, as recommended by the CHMP, the Applicant has in addition identified this potential risk of an adverse reproductive outcome as part of the RMP.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.2.">Pharmacokinetics</head><p>Pharmacokinetic data for burosumab are available from six clinical studies in XLH patients; four Phase 1 or</p><p>Phase 1/2 studies in adults and two Phase 2 studies in children at 1-4 years and 5-12 years of age, respectively <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">(Table 1)</ref>.  Rich pharmacokinetic data are available from three of the studies in adults, and these were analysed using non-compartmental methods. In addition, the adult pharmacokinetic data (except data from a Phase 1 study in Japanese and Korean patients) were combined in a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Only sparse data are available from the paediatric studies, and the data was analysed using population pharmacokinetic methods.</p><p>There is no data from healthy volunteers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacokinetic bioanalysis</head><p>Serum concentrations of burosumab were determined using two different assays. An Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay, developed by Kyowa Hakko Kirin California was used to analyse study samples from the three adult studies included in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. An electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay based on Meso-Scale Discovery (MSD) methodology was subsequently Assessment report EMA/148319/2018 Page 37/130 developed at Toray Research Center and later moved to BioAgilytix Labs and revalidated. This assay was used to analyses samples from the study in Japanese/Korean adults and from the two paediatric studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of anti-burosumab antibodies</head><p>Immunogenicity of burosumab was evaluated in all clinical trials in the burosumab development program.</p><p>The initial assay used to detect anti-burosumab antibodies in human serum was a sandwich ELISA, which was used on serum samples from subjects enrolled in the single-ascending dose study KRN23-US-02 in adult patients. To improve the sensitivity of the anti-burosumab antibody assay in human serum the assay was redeveloped to use the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) platform based on electrochemiluminescence (ECL) signal detection. This assay was used in subsequent studies. The Applicant has since filing of the MAA developed a new acid dissociation method with significantly higher drug tolerance, which was successfully validated. All available study samples will be re-tested using the new method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Absorption</head><p>In the phase 1 and Phase 1/2 studies with PK evaluation, subcutaneous burosumab was injected in the abdomen. In the Phase 2 studies in children, the injection site was rotated with each injection between the abdomen, upper arms, or thighs. Injection site will be rotated also in the ongoing Phase 3 studies.</p><p>After subcutaneous administration to adults, burosumab absorption was slow with Tmax between 7 and 11 days. Bioavailability of burosumab after subcutaneous administration was high, 90% and 128% for the 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg doses, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distribution</head><p>After single-dose intravenous administration to adults (study KRN23-US-02), Vss for burosumab ranged between 44 and 57 ml/kg, indicating limited distribution. There is no in vitro data on protein binding or active transport, which is acceptable for an antibody.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Elimination</head><p>No studies have been performed to characterise the elimination mechanisms of burosumab. Its metabolism and elimination are expected to follow the immunoglobulin clearance pathways, resulting in degradation to small peptides and amino acids.</p><p>The clearance of burosumab is low and is suggested to be dependent on body weight. After intravenous administration to adult patients, mean clearance ranged between 0.14 and 0.21 ml/hr/kg across dose groups and appeared to be independent of dose at doses of 0.003 to 0.3 mg/kg.</p><p>Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from adult and paediatric patients the point estimate of CL/F for a 70 kg person after subcutaneous administration was 0.29 L/Day (0.17 ml/hr/kg) ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 2)</ref>.</p><p>The mean terminal half-life of burosumab in adults ranged from 8 to 12 days after intravenous doses and from 13 to 19 days after subcutaneous administration, indicating absorption-rate limited elimination at subcutaneous administration. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, for a typical 13 kg patient a half-life of around 16 days was estimated. The PK values are mean±SD for NCA analysis, and point estimates for population PK (NLME) modeling. * Derived from typical value of CL/F (0.279 L/day) in a 70-kg XLH patient</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Linearity</head><p>Burosumab pharmacokinetics appeared to be linear from 0.1 to 1 mg/kg according to the population pharmacokinetic analysis based on adult and paediatric data. Time dependency of burosumab has not been formally evaluated. Given that dose adjustments, as guided by pharmacodynamic response, was allowed in the multiple dose studies the time to reach steady state at a single dose level could not be determined.</p><p>Based on an elimination half-life of about 19 days, time to steady state would be expected to be reached within 12 weeks (at dose no. 4 at Q4W dosing) if no dose adjustments were made.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacokinetics in target population</head><p>Exposure data at steady state of the therapeutic dose is limited.</p><p>There is only one study in adults with multiple dosing at the therapeutic dose, and only sparse pharmacokinetic data are available from this study. Also in children only sparse data are available.</p><p>Exposure at steady state with therapeutic dosing was simulated using the population pharmacokinetic model.</p><p>The exposure estimation in children was based on the last reported dose level and therefore reflects the individual dose adjustments made based on a PD endpoint. At steady state, the mean dose level was about 11.8 mg and 39 mg in children 1-4 years and 5-12 years, respectively. The estimated mean AUCtau was 204 µg*day/ml and 269 µg*day/ml, respectively. The numbers should be interpreted with some caution as they are based on sparse data and mainly C trough levels.</p><p>There is yet no pharmacokinetic data in adolescents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special populations</head><p>There are no pharmacokinetic studies in renal or hepatic impairment.</p><p>During development of the combined population pharmacokinetic model in adults and children an effect of weight on the CL/F of burosumab was assumed, and it was included already in the structural models. The inclusion of weight in the models was suggested to well predict the effect of body weight on the pharmacokinetic parameters of burosumab, justifying dosing by bodyweight.</p><p>Gender and age were tested as co-variates but were not significant. The studied adult age range was 25-68 years. Based on a between-study comparison, mean CL/F per kg in patients from Japan or Korea might be somewhat higher than in Caucasian patients.</p><p>No in vitro or in vivo pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been performed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.3.">Pharmacodynamics</head><p>Serum phosphorus concentration, serum 1,25(OH)2D concentration, and TmP/GFR were increased from baseline after KRN23 administration in adult single dose studies. No apparent safety concerns were identified.</p><p>The pharmacodynamics results in main clinical studies are discussed within respective study in clinical efficacy and safety sections of this AR.</p><p>In both adult and paediatric populations, FGF23 is markedly increased by KRN23 treatment (almost 3000-fold in the paediatric study UX023-CL201 and more than 800-fold in the adult study UX023-CL203); this unexpected finding is discussed further in detail in the safety section of this AR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anti-burosumab antibodies</head><p>Across the four clinical studies conducted in adult XLH patients, only one subject tested positive for antiburosumab binding antibodies, at pre-dose as well as after burosumab administration. This patient tested negative for anti-burosumab neutralising antibodies. Among the paediatric patients, anti-burosumab antibodies were detected in four patients. These patients presented with anti-burosumab antibodies only at baseline and the results were suggested to be within the false positive threshold for the analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.4.">Discussion on clinical pharmacology</head><p>The pharmacokinetic evaluation of a new active substance should aim at characterising the pharmacokinetic properties of the substance, in order to possibly support the proposed dose regimen and to predict situations and patient groups where exposure may be clinically significantly different from that in the pivotal efficacy/safety study population. Evaluation of exposure-response and/or exposure-toxicity relationships may aid estimation of what is a clinically relevant difference in exposure. Burosumab is an antibody, and some aspects of the pharmacokinetic behaviour can therefore be predicted without specific studies. In addition, the dose or dose interval of burosumab will be individually adjusted based on a pharmacodynamic endpoint, serum phosphorous levels. The possibility to predict differences in pharmacokinetics/exposure due to intrinsic factors is therefore not critical.</p><p>The ELISA and ECL assays used to determine burosumab serum levels were adequately validated. No comparison of bioavailability of burosumab between different injection sites has been performed, which is acceptable as the injection site will be rotated in clinical practice.</p><p>Lack of studies to characterise the elimination mechanisms for burosumab is acceptable as it is expected to follow the normal immunoglobulin clearance pathways. Therefore, also lack of pharmacokinetic studies in renal or hepatic impairment is acceptable.</p><p>A weight-based dosing appears justified based on the population PK analyses.</p><p>From a strict pharmacokinetic point of view, the lack of data in adolescents and the limited data in children 1-4 years of age is acceptable, given that the dose is individualised based on a PD parameter. In addition, major differences in PK in different age groups might not be expected for an antibody.</p><p>Lack of data on pharmacokinetic drug interaction potential is acceptable. The disposition of burosumab is not expected to be dependent on metabolising enzymes or transport proteins. Direct effects of an antibody on metabolism or transport of other drugs are also not expected. In addition, burosumab is not reported to affect cytokine levels, and therefore secondary effects on cytokine inhibition of CYP activity are not expected.</p><p>Adequate methodology has been used in the population PK analyses. The combined population PK/PD analyses in children and adults indicate that the burosumab effect on serum phosphorus levels is similar in both patient populations. The model is an improvement on the previous model, although there is a tendency for over-prediction in the heavier paediatric subjects at very high concentrations which needs to be considered when using the model for extrapolation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.5.">Conclusions on clinical pharmacology</head><p>The clinical pharmacology data for burosumab is considered sufficient, and there are no outstanding issues.</p><p>For future measurements with the new ADA assay, the CHMP recommends to verify the established cutpoints for the ADA assay in patient population-specific sera, if possible, and report any potentially significant impact on the immunogenicity assessment. Furthermore, it is noted that in the PK/PD model there is a tendency for over-prediction in the heavier paediatric subjects at very high concentrations and the CHMP recommends to consider this in case of the potential use of this model for extrapolation in the future.</p><p>Assessment report EMA/148319/2018 Page 41/130 </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatments</head><p>Subjects were enrolled sequentially into cohorts defined by the initial dose of KRN23; within each dose cohort, subjects were randomised to a Q2W or to a Q4W regimen. All subjects received KRN23 by SC injection. Initial doses were 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 mg/kg Q2W or 0.2, 0.4 or 0.4 mg/kg Q4W, based on sequential enrolment and randomization; subsequent doses were adjusted every 4 weeks in 0.3 mg/kg increments, as needed, based on 2-week post-dose (peak) fasting serum phosphorus levels. Radiographs were obtained during the study to for the assessment of rickets and other bone abnormalities.</p><p>Bilateral anteroposterior (AP) knee radiographs and bilateral posteroanterior (PA) hand/wrist radiographs were obtained at Screening Visit 1 and at the Weeks 40 and 64 study visits. Standing long leg radiographs were obtained at Screening Visit 1 and at the Week 64 study visit.</p><p>The severity of rickets was measured using a modified version of a scale developed by Thomas Thacher, MD <ref type="bibr">(Thacher et al. 2000</ref>). The RSS system is a radiographic scoring method developed to assess the severity of nutritional rickets in the wrists and knees based on the degree of metaphyseal fraying, concavity, and the proportion of the growth plate affected. RSS was scored using a predefined methodology (Biomedical Systems Independent Review Manual, September 2014); each radiograph was scored individually without the need to reference back to a screening image for comparison, which allows the rater to remain blinded to radiograph sequence and treatment status. The method has been shown to have good intra-and inter-rater reliability (correlations of 0.89 and 0.84, respectively) <ref type="bibr">(Thacher et al. 2000)</ref>. RSS scores for XLH patients are, however, lower than those observed in nutritional rickets due to differences in the radiographic appearance of rickets between the two diseases that are impacted by the scoring methodology.</p><p>RSS scores range from 0 to 4 for the wrist and 0 to 6 for the knee, with higher scores associated with greater rickets severity. These scores are summed to generate an RSS total score and in XLH typically does not exceed 4.0.</p><p>Thomas Thacher, MD, the developer of the RSS methodology, served as the single, central, independent rater and performed all RSS scoring for this study, as well as for Study UX023-CL002.

Radiograph pairs were presented for review in random order.</p><p>The rater is asked to indicate the presence or absence of a series of XLH-related abnormalities such as metaphyseal lucency, metaphyseal/epiphyseal separation, metaphyseal fraying, and metaphyseal concave cupping, which are essentially the same radiographic features evaluated in the RSS. Once the presence or absence of these abnormalities has been recorded, the rater is asked to integrate the information and rate changes in these abnormalities based on the appearance of Image B relative to Image A using the following 7-point ordinal RGI-C scale.</p><p>The RGI-C global score is an overall score based on the general impression of change in the wrist and knee images -it is not calculated based on the RGI-C wrist and knee scores that have already been assigned. The rater also assigns an RGI-C leg score based on the standing long leg radiographs. Changes in lower extremity deformities were assessed at Week 64 as part of the RGI-C evaluation. For each RGI-C score (wrist, knee, global and leg), the average of the scores assigned by the three independent raters were used for analysis.</p><p>As a means to further reduce potential bias, additional radiographs were included in the batches reviewed.</p><p>RSS measures the rickets severity in single radiographs. In contrast, RGI-C measures the change in paired radiographs. RGI-C assessment could therefore overestimate healing effect in a study, where all patients received active treatment. It is much preferred for the RSS tool to be the main analysis tool for x-rays in the current development programme. The RGI-C tool is considered to be supportive only. third-party vendor. Randomisation was initially stratified by gender but not after the implementation of amendment 3 when the study was expanded to include additional subjects with RSS of at least 1.5 at the knee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical methods</head><p>For the primary efficacy endpoint, Change from Baseline in severity of rickets as measured by RSS total score, the null hypothesis of no change from Baseline of RSS total score was tested using a one sample t test.

In addition, 3 patients had nephrocalcinosis grade ≥ 3 by renal ultrasound. The study is ongoing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conduct of the study</head><p>The original version of Protocol UX023-CL201 was dated 24 February 2014 and was amended five times.</p><p>Several of the amendments had an impact on study conduct and a number of the changes made were based on evolving data and/or experience:</p><p>Within Protocol Amendment 3 (dated 02 March 2015) cohort 3 was expanded to include up to 30 subjects for a total study population of up to 50 subjects, a Rickets Severity Score (RSS) at the knee of at least 1.5, as determined by a central reader, was required for inclusion in the expansion group and because the enrollment criteria were adjusted to require a specific level of rickets severity, gender-related differences in the severity of skeletal disease were minimized and the requirement for gender balance was removed for the expansion group. To indicate that changes in rickets severity was to be evaluated by two methods; the RSS method was added to the Radiograph Global Impression of Change (RGI-C) system and details about blinding of radiographic assessments were added.</p><p>With protocol Amendment 4 (dated 22 April 2015) target serum phosphorus range was changed to 5.0 mg/dL from 4.5 mg/dL, the dose titration scheme was updated. The maximum dose of KRN23 was updated to allow the group of subjects in regimen Q2 to increase the dose up to 2.0 mg/kg Q2 if needed and to add that in both the Q2 and Q4 groups the maximum allowable dose is 90 mg.</p><p>This change was based on the finding that some subjects needed doses higher than 1.0 mg/dL (0.32 mmol/L) to achieve the serum phosphorus target, regardless of whether the dose was given at the Q2W or Q4W dose regimen. Approximately half of the subjects in the Q4W regimen were already receiving doses above 1.0 mg/dL (0.32 mmol/L) to achieve the proposed target serum phosphorus range, and no safety concerns were raised.</p><p>Protocol Amendment 5 (dated 28 August 2015) incorporated a 96-week Treatment Extension Period into the study design to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of KRN23. During the Treatment Extension Period, all subjects receive Q2W administration of KRN23.</p><p>The transition of subjects to Q2W dosing reflected interim Week 40 findings related to serum phosphorus levels, rickets, and dose. Subjects in the Q2W dosing regimen showed a more stable and consistent increase in serum phosphorus levels with less fluctuation over time than in subjects who received KRN23 Q4W for whom serum phosphorus levels increased at the middle of the dose cycle (week 2) but tended to return to baseline at the end of the dose interval (week 4).</p><p>Protocol Amendment 6 (dated 07 July 2016) was implemented after the data cut-off date of 16 June 2016 to clarify language and procedures regarding dose adjustment, to add an option for non-healthcare provider administration of study drug under certain conditions; to add reflexive genetic testing to assess additional genes associated with phenotypes overlapping with XLH if initial PHEX mutation analysis is negative or inconclusive; and to clarify or update study procedures and assessments.    and a score of 40 is the lower limit of the normal range).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Numbers analysed</head><p>The ITT, PK/PD, and safety analysis sets were the same and comprised all 52 subjects. Clinical efficacy evaluations:   Greater improvements in RSS scores were observed in subjects with greater disease severity at Baseline. In subjects with low RSS scores at Baseline and little room for improvement by this measure, the low level of rachitic disease remained low to Week 64 of the study. This result demonstrates that KRN23 efficacy was greater in patients with more severe disease as compared with those with less severe disease.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RSS Scores Change From Baseline to Week 40 by Baseline Rickets Severity Subgroups</head><p>RSS data were analyzed using the prespecified responder definition (ie, reduction in RSS total score from Baseline of at least 1.0 points). Overall, 66.7% of subjects were RSS responders at Week 64 (Q2W: 70.0%, Q4W: 63.2%). All subjects in the higher RSS subgroup had Baseline RSS total score ≥ 1.0 and were included in the responder analysis.     A borderline significant increase in growth velocity was seen from 5.35 to 5.91 cm/year (p=0.0e) as well as improvement in age/gender adjusted standing height Z score +0.15 (p&lt;0.0001).</p><p>The numbers for change in height variables indicated better outcomes in Q2 group. However, it is noted that baseline z-score and standing height percentiles were lower at baseline in Q4W group.</p><p>Growth is a complex issue to investigate and a large individual variation has been observed. Therefore, results from the confirmatory phase 3 study are awaited before including claims on growth in the SmPC section 5.1.</p><p>The mean weight increase was apparently higher in the q2w regimen (4.9kg) vs. Q4w regimen (3.6kg) which seems reasonable as q2w regimen group also had a tendency to faster growth. Mean weight z-scores were nearly unchanged. However, some subjects had a disproportionate weight increase, an issue to be followed in the randomised study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of Subjects Planned and Analyzed:</head><p>Approximately 10 paediatric subjects were planned for enrollment and 13 subjects were enrolled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Eligibility:</head><p>Subjects were between 1 and 4 years old, inclusive, with clinical findings consistent with XLH, including hypophosphataemia and radiographic evidence of rickets (at least 5 subjects were required to have a Rickets Severity Score [RSS] at the knee of ≥ 1.5 points at Screening), and a confirmed PHEX mutation or variant of uncertain significance. To maintain a level of gender balance, no more than 7 subjects of either gender were enrolled. Subjects unwilling to stop treatment with any oral phosphate and/or active vitamin D therapy during screening and for the duration of the study were excluded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dose</head><p>Subjects received KRN23 at a starting total dose of 0.8 mg/kg. The dose may be increased to 1.2 mg/kg at any time if a subject meets the following dose adjustment criteria: 1) two consecutive serum phosphorus measurements are below the normal range; 2) serum phosphorus has increased by &lt; 0.5 mg/dL from baseline; and 3) the subject has not missed a dose of study drug that would account for the decrease in serum phosphorus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Endpoints</head><p>Safety, efficacy, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic endpoints were approximately similar than in the study Study UX023-CL201.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subject Disposition:</head><p>A total of 13 paediatric subjects were enrolled into the study; enrollment is closed. All 13 subjects were included in each analysis set (Efficacy Analysis Set, PK/PD Analysis Set, and Safety Analysis Set Total enrollment was 9 boys (69.2%) and 4 girls (30.8%). Although the study aimed to maintain gender balance by enrolling no more than 7 subjects of either gender, based on a target enrollment of approximately 10 subjects, enrollment of 9 boys among 13 total subjects maintained the 70% single gender ratio sought.</p><p>One patient was screened for the study and was not enrolled (Subject 138-507) because they did not meet the entry criteria for biochemical findings associated with XLH (serum phosphorus and creatinine levels)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baseline Demographics and Medical History:</head><p>Per the enrollment criteria, all subjects in this study were paediatric, with ages ranging from 1 to 4 years </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rickets Severity at Baseline:</head><p>RSS scores from radiographs taken at Screening prior to the initiation of KRN23 treatment and used as baseline results showed the presence of rickets (RSS score &gt; 0) in all subjects at both the knee and the wrists. Mean (SD) RSS baseline scores were 2.92 (1.367) overall, 1.65 (0.801) at the knee, and 1.27 (0.696) at the wrist. The higher prevalence of rickets in the knees is likely due to faster growth and larger bones at the distal femur and proximal tibia/fibula compared with the wrist.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Extent of Exposure:</head><p>As Week 40). Three subjects had dose increases to 1.2 mg/kg Q2W based on the protocol-specified dose adjustment criteria; dose was increased at Week 22 for 2 subjects and at Week 34 for one subject. For all 3 subjects with dose increases, burosumab dose was continued at the increased dose (1.2 mg/kg Q2W) through the data cutoff date.</p><p>The mean total dose per administration ranged from 10.2 to 13.0 mg through Week 40.</p><p>Pharmacodynamic Results:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Serum Phosphorus</head><p>The primary efficacy endpoint is this study is the change from baseline over time in serum phosphorus.</p><p>At Baseline, all subjects had serum phosphorus levels below normal, with a mean (SD) of 2.51 (0.284) mg/dL (0.81 [0.092] mmol/L) compared with the normal range of 3.2 to 6.1 mg/dL (1.03 to 1.97 mmol/L).</p><p>Burosumab treatment rapidly and substantially increased mean serum phosphorus levels with mean concentrations above the lower limit of normal (LLN) at all post-Baseline time points. Increases in serum phosphorus concentration from Baseline were statistically significant at each study visit (p &lt; 0.0001, GEE analysis). At Week 40, mean (SD). . In previous studies in adults with XLH, maximum increases from baseline in serum 1,25(OH)2D levels were observed at approximately 1 week after the first KRN23 dose. Therefore, this pattern of increase in serum 1,25(OH)2D with a maximum value at Week 1 is consistent with previous findings.</p><p>No hypercalcaemia was observed in response to the increase in serum 1,25(OH)2D.</p><p>The assay method for serum 1,25(OH)2D concentrations changed during the study. The change in assay methodology was therefore considered to result in an underestimation in the increase of mean serum 1,25(OH)2D concentration at Week 20.   </p></div>

Only these subjects could serve as controls for the radiologic outcomes in the UX023-CL002 study.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcomes and estimation</head><p>Subjects in the Radiographic Analysis Set had received conventional therapy for approximately 8 years at the time of the post-baseline radiographs, with more than 6 years of treatment prior to the time of the baseline radiographs and an additional mean 1.7 years (median 1.97 years [102 weeks]) from the time of the baseline to post-baseline radiographs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Severity of rickets as measured by RSS:</head><p>In the analysis of 47 paired matching baseline and post-baseline radiographs, total RSS score decreased by 12% (from a mean of 1.33 to 1.17) at the time of the post-baseline radiographs.</p><p>Subgroups were also evaluated based on whether baseline radiographs had higher RSS (RSS total score ≥ 1.5) or lower RSS (RSS total score &lt; 1.5). Total RSS score decreased by 25% (from a mean of 1.88 to 1.42) in the higher RSS subgroup (25 paired radiographs), but increased by 26% (from a mean of 0.70 to 0.89) in the lower RSS subgroup (22 paired radiographs).</p><p>In the RGI-C, positive scores indicate healing of rickets (+1.0=minimal healing, +2.0=substantial healing, +3.0=complete healing) and negative scores indicate worsening of rickets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Change in severity of rickets and bowing as measured by RGI-C</head><p>The mean RGI-C global score was +0.79 for the overall group, +0.85 for the higher RSS subgroup (RSS total score ≥ 1.5), and +0.69 for the lower RSS subgroup.

Study UX023-CL002, a total of 35 subjects (Radiographic Analysis Set) was used as the primary analysis dataset and included 60 paired wrist and knee images. Because RSS and RGI-C assessments were conducted in a blinded manner with some individual subjects contributing more than one pair of wrist and knee radiographs, it was necessary to characterize results based on data corresponding to the paired radiographs (N1) rather than to the subjects (N). There were a smaller proportion of females in the UX023-CL201 cohort than in the UX023-CL002 cohort (50% and 68%). Other measured characteristics associated with rickets severity, were comparable. Baseline characteristics for Study UX023-CL002 in the above table were, however, based not on unique subjects but number of evaluable radiograph pairs.</p></div>

A post hoc sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore potential bias with subjects contributing multiple radiographs to the RSS analysis. In the sensitivity analysis, only one radiograph pair was selected for each subject based on the following criteria:</p><p>1. If a radiograph pair had one or both radiographs showing growth plates fused or partially fused, the radiograph pair was excluded;</p><p>2. If a subject had multiple radiograph pairs, the one with highest baseline RSS total score was selected. Based on these criteria, a total of 30 of the 35 subjects in the Radiographic Analysis Set qualified for the sensitivity analysis. In the sensitivity analysis, mean (SD) RSS total scores decreased from 1.32 (0.83) for the baseline radiographs to 1.03 (0.75) for the post-baseline radiographs, a mean (SD) change of -0.28</p><p>(1.07) to be compared with the difference of -0.16 in the above figure.</p><p>An additional sensitivity analysis where the subjects baseline radiograph with lowest baseline RSS total score was selected was requested and has been performed. In this analysis there was no evident improvement compared to baseline in either knee or wrist and hence not in total score.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Paediatric population 5-12 years</head><p>Design and conduct of the study UX023-CL201 is a randomised, multicentre, open-label, dose finding Phase 2 study. The study was conducted in prepubescent children aged 5-12 years with XLH to assess the PD and safety of KRN23 administered via subcutaneous (SC) injections monthly (Q4W) or biweekly (Q2W). 64 weeks of treatment data is now available.</p><p>A number of interim analyses were performed at various time-points. They were descriptive in nature but have seemingly had an impact on study conduct and planned analyses (increased sample size, revised inclusion criteria, cut-off for RSS subgroup analyses). The study protocol was amended 5 times. In addition, results from this study had seemingly been communicated (i.e. before data cut-off for the current analyses) and eventually also been published. There were therefore concerns regarding the dissemination of results, their potential violation of the credibility of the study results that followed and potential impact on study integrity. The Applicant has, as requested, clarified dates for protocol amendments, interim/primary analyses and press releases and argues that it is unlikely that e.g. interim analyses and publications of study data while study UX023-CL201 was ongoing have introduced any bias. However, considering the open-label design and the lack of a concurrent control group, concern regarding the impact on study integrity that the interim analyses and the communication of study results may have had, remains. However, the CHMP was of the view that it is unlikely to significantly change the conclusions from the study. The outcomes from the phase 2 study (UX023-CL201) will need to be confirmed in the ongoing phase 3.</p><p>The study initially enrolled 36 paediatric subjects with XLH and radiographic evidence of bone disease (preexpansion subjects). When fully enrolled, the study was expanded (protocol amendment 3) to include additional subjects in cohort 3 for a total of approximately 50 subjects overall. Expansion subjects were required to have a level of rickets severity of at least 1.5 points at the knee as defined by the Rickets Severity Score (RSS) method.</p><p>The Applicant has also presented a historical cohort study in a paediatric population (n=52) on conventional therapy, study UXO23-CL002. Baseline age and disease severity matched with subjects in study UX023-CL201. Results from this study were used to put the treatment response observed in subjects treated with KRN23, into the context of the disease and the existing treatment (i.e., conventional therapy with oral phosphate and active vitamin D).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy data and additional analyses</head><p>In study UX023-CL201 overall, the rickets severity RSS total score was reduced 50% from baseline to Week 41, from 1.80 to 0.90; p&lt;0.0001. In the Q2W group, the reduction was 61% (p=0.0001) RGI-C wrist, knee and global score increased (p&lt;0.0001) in both Q2 and Q4 groups at Week 40. All patients received treatment Q2 after 40 weeks. The available data week 64 indicates similar effect size than the previously submitted</p><p>week 40 data with mean RSS of 0.88.</p><p>In a comparison with a historical cohort (study UX023-CL002, children with conventional therapy), a larger correction of rachitic abnormalities measured by RSS (38% vs 12%) and RGI-C (+1.38 vs +0.79) was seen in patients who received KRN23 in study UX023-CL201. RSS total score improved most in the Q2W subgroup and was comparable in Q4W and conventional historical treatment group at week 40.</p><p>From baseline to week 64, a borderline increase in growth velocity was seen from 5.35 to 5.91 cm/year as well as improvement in standing height Z score +0.15 (p&lt;0.0001). The mean improvement in 6MWT was +47 m overall (p&lt;0.001) and +77 m in those with &lt;80% predicted at baseline (p&lt;0.0001). Week 40 (mean change: -17%) and to 115 (31) μg/L at Week 64 (mean change: -29%), and decreases were similar in the two dose groups.</p><p>The proposed posology in the SmPC is not in line with the posology used in the main paediatric study UX023-CL201 (that was also a dose finding study, starting from doses as low as 0.1mg/kg) but the proposed starting dose reflects the therapeutic dose level (0.8mg/kg Q2W) in study UX023-CL201. Thereafter, individual titration is needed for achieving low normal phosphate levels and this should be performed according to the phosphate levels as stated in the SmPC. This dosing strategy has also been implemented in the paediatric study UX023-CL205 through 24 weeks using a starting dose of 0.8 mg/kg Q2W. From a safety point of view, a starting dose of 0.4 mg/kg is the lowest maintenance dose in study UX023-CL201 and is now advised in the SmPC section 4.2. The dose is proposed to be titrated stepwise every four weeks with 0.4 mg/kg; i.e dose of 0.8 mg/kg is achieved already after four weeks of treatment. This rather conservative approach to dose titration may change after additional safety results from the conditional randomized phase 3 study (specific obligation; study UX023-CL301).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Paediatric population 1-4 years</head><p>Design and conduct of the study Study UX023-CL205 is a multicentre, open-label, Phase 2 study in children from 1 to 4 years old with XLH who are naïve to therapy or have previously received conventional therapy with oral phosphate and active vitamin D to assess the safety, PD, PK, and efficacy of KRN23 administered via subcutaneous (SC) injections every 2 weeks (Q2W) for a total of 64 weeks. The current analysis includes data from 13 subjects through</p><p>week 40. Subjects who complete the study may continue into an extension study. This study is being conducted at three centers in the United States (specific obligation study UX023-CL205).</p></div>

In this study, length/standing height, expressed both as a percentile for age and gender and as Z scores, tended to decrease instead of expected increase. No claims on growth are included in the SmPC for any age group.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.6.">Conclusions on clinical efficacy</head><p>The method of administration (subcutaneously every 2 weeks, Q2) is a potential general advantage In study UX023-CL201, all included paediatric 52 subjects completed week 40. This supports a good tolerability of burosumab as well as a patient/caregiver preference to the experimental therapy compared to the conventional therapy they had received before the study. The laboratory endpoints as well as nearly all radiological and clinical efficacy variables indicated better outcomes in Q2 dosing group compared to Q4.</p><p>Generally a more pronounced effect was seen in the severe RSS subgroup.</p><p>Laboratory variables s-phosphate and ALP can be considered as surrogate markers for disease severity in Xlinked hypophosphataemia and their demonstrated improvement indicate benefit of the treatment. Any radiological evidence of rickets healing, as observed in the studies, can be considered supportive for that pharmacological effect is clinically relevant.</p><p>The CHMP considers that efficacy results from the age group 5-12 years can be extrapolated to ages 1 to 4 years old, in light of the available data on pharmacodynamics parameters from this age group. Study UX023-CL205 is considered as a specific obligation. Final results of Study UX023-CL205 will be submitted in line with the due date setup in the specific obligation.</p><p>The RSS scoring methodology has previously been used for the assessment of the severity of nutritional rickets. There is no golden standard method of scoring radiological changes in XLH. However, the Applicant has used RSS scale now in study UX023-CL201 and for historical controls in UX023-CL002. For this orphan disease, finding another XLH population in order to further validate the scale seems difficult. Improvements of these parameters with burosumab were shown. The magnitude of effect and clinical relevance is difficult to interpret in paediatric patients with the current study design. This is also a concern regarding variables growth, 6 MWT, functional disability and pain. UX023-CL201 is a randomized, open-label, dose finding, phase 2 study to assess the pharmacodynamics and safety of the anti-FGF23 antibody, KRN23, in paediatric patients with XLH and is considered as a specific obligation. Final results will be submitted by the Applicant in line with the due date setup in the specific obligation.</p><p>As no control group without active treatment was included, a comparison of such (paediatric) open-label study results with external historical controls on conventional therapy thus did not allow a fully comprehensive assessment of efficacy. As comprehensive data on the product were not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was requested by the applicant in the submission and a comparatorcontrolled study is being performed to provide fully comprehensive data eventually. Study UX023-CL301is a randomized, open-label, phase 3 Study to assess the pharmacodynamics, efficacy, safety of the anti-FGF23 antibody, KRN23, versus oral phosphate and active vitamin D in paediatric patients with XLH and is considered as a specific obligation. Final results will be submitted by the Applicant in line with the due date setup in the specific obligation.</p><p>For this skeletal disease it is appropriate to limit the indication to children and adolescents with growing skeletons as reflected by the studied population: The current paediatric studies have included only children with radiographic evidence of bone disease but very mildly affected individuals with XLH may have hypophosphataemia without other signs and symptoms throughout the life.</p></div>

In ongoing study UX023-CL303 (data cut-off date 22-Dec-2016), 134 subjects were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to KRN23 (68 subjects) or placebo (66 subjects). Throughout the double-blind Placebocontrolled Treatment Period, the mean duration of exposure to study drug was similar in both treatment groups and indicates all subjects received the full 24-weeks of protocol-specified treatment. Through the data cut-off, subjects have been exposed to KRN23 for up to 367 days (~1 year). The total subject-years of exposure to KRN23 were 47.86 years. Throughout the double-blind period (Weeks 0-24), both treatment groups received stable doses of blinded study drug treatment (based on 1 mg/kg dosing). In both groups, the observed median weight-based dose of blinded study drug was 1.0 mg/kg.</p><p>The protocol specified criteria for treatment assignment unblinding and dose adjustments due to elevated serum phosphorus levels. Most subjects did not require such dose adjustments. Through the double-blind period, five (7.3%) subjects in the KRN23 group had treatment unblinded per protocol. One subject (207-303) had one dose withheld at Week 12 per protocol. The dose was reduced to 0.5 mg/kg and maintained at that level through Week 24 in four of the five subjects; one subject required an additional dose reduction.</p><p>Furthermore, 15 subjects with tumour-induced osteomalacia (TIO) or epidermal nevus syndrome (ENS) have been treated with KRN23 in study UX023T-CL201 (data cut-off date 25-May-2016) with a total cumulative exposure of 6.47 patient years.</p><p>In the single-dose adult XLH studies, the mean KRN23 total dose ranged from 6.1 mg for intravenous (IV) administration to 38.2 mg for subcutaneous (SC) administration, corresponding to 0.09 mg/kg for IV administration and 0.59 mg/kg for SC administration, respectively.</p></div>

In the other paediatric study, UX023-CL201, 52 children aged 5-12 years were treated with Burosumab for at least 64 weeks.</p><p>In the adult primary safety data set from study KRN23-INT001/002, UX023-CL203 and UX023-CL304, 31 subjects aged 19-66 years were treated with KRN23 for a median of 79.9 weeks at data cut-off date.</p><p>In the only placebo-controlled study, ongoing study UX023-CL303, 134 subjects were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to KRN23 (68 subjects) or placebo (66 subjects). All subjects have reached at least Week 24.</p><p>Furthermore, 15 subjects with tumour-induced osteomalacia (TIO) or epidermal nevus syndrome (ENT) (indications not included in the current application) have been treated with burosumab with a cumulative exposure of 6.47 patient years.</p><p>No fatalities are reported in any of the studies, neither in children nor adults.</p><p>All subjects in the paediatric studies reported a TEAE. Two subjects in study UX023-CL201 and one in study UX023-CL205 experienced grade 3 TEAEs, none of which was considered related to study treatment.</p><p>In study UX023-CL201, one subject experienced two concurrent serious TEAEs of high fever and myalgia, which were considered Grade 2 in severity. The event was deemed as possibly related to study treatment.</p><p>The patient recovered spontaneously, and study treatment was ongoing as of the data cut-off for this report, with no interruptions in the subsequent study dosing regimen. In study UX023-CL205, one SAE of tooth abscess has been reported. The event was deemed as unlikely related to study treatment, and burosumab treatment was not interrupted.</p><p>The majority of TEAEs considered related to the study drug are correlated to injection site reactions. In study UX023-CL201, such TEAEs occurred somewhat more often in the Q2W treatment arm, as expected.</p><p>Disturbances in vitamin D homeostasis (both decreased and increased levels) were more common in the Q4W than the Q2W group. One possible explanation could be that dose adjustments are easier with drug administrations every second week.</p><p>The three most reported TEAEs in study UX023-CL201 were headache (65.4%), cough and nasopharyngitis, paediatric studies were open-label, no comparison to untreated subjects can be done. It is noted that several of these, e.g. headache, cough and nasopharyngitis, are phenomena frequently occurring in a paediatric population. The prevalence of headache in children and adolescents is approximately 54% to 58%. It should however be noted that the incidence of headache was more common in the treatment group compared to placebo in adult study UX023-CL303, indicating a potential causal association to burosumab.</p><p>No subjects in the paediatric studies have discontinued the study due to TEAEs.</p><p>In the adult repeat-dose studies KRN23 INT-001/002, UX023-CL203 and UX023-CL304, all of the subjects experienced a TEAE, most of whom (77%) had a TEAE of Grade 2 or less. Ten subjects reported TEAEs grade 2-3 that were considered related to the study drug. The majority of TEAEs considered related to the study drug are correlated to injection site reactions.</p><p>Three adult subjects (10%) were discontinued from the studies KRN23-INT-001/002 by the investigator due to adverse events (i.e. injection site urticaria, exacerbation of pre-existing nephrolithiasis, and worsening of pre-existing restless legs syndrome). Two of the subjects later enrolled study UX023-CL203, and remains in the study to date.</p><p>In the placebo-controlled adult study UX023-CL303, the incidence of reported TEAE was comparable in the two groups (92.4% in the placebo group and 94.1 % in the KRN23 group). The main imbalances were found in two SOCs: Nervous system disorders (i.e. headache, dizziness, and RLS) (KRN23: 38.2%; placebo:</p><p>24.2%) and Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (KRN23: 36.8%; placebo: 45.5%).</p><p>In adult and paediatric populations, pain in extremity, arthralgia and myalgia were common. The applicant suggested that this may be related to XLH, and CHMP agreed that it is difficult to differentiate between symptoms from the underlying disease from adverse effect regarding musculoskeletal symptoms. This is further supported by musculoskeletal symptoms being more common in the placebo group in study UX023-</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CL303.</head><p>In total, eleven serious adverse events were reported in the adult population, none of which was considered related to the therapy. Due to the time relation between the exposure and the event, confounding factors and/or lack of known biologic rationale/mechanism of action of study drug that could account for the event, this is agreed.</p><p>In preclinical studies, the primary toxicological effects of burosumab were soft tissue and organ mineralization. Furthermore, in a 40 week, repeat dose study in monkeys, impaired cardiac function was recorded during the recovery period in males receiving high dose (30 mg/kg) burosumab. It is noted that this occurred in the context of supra-physiological levels of phosphate greater than 8 mg/dL.</p><p>As opposed to the XLH-patients, preclinical studies of burosumab were conducted in wild type animals which do not have excess FGF23 and hence normal baseline phosphate levels and phosphate physiology.</p><p>Burosumab treatment thus leads to prolonged and excessive antagonism of the normal regulatory actions of FGF23 on renal tubular phosphate resorption and vitamin D metabolism and hyperphosphataemia. This must be taken into consideration when extrapolating safety from preclinical data, as some of the burosumab effects on animals may be attributed to hyperphosphataemia.</p><p>Classical biomarkers used clinically to assess risk for ectopic mineralisation are serum phosphate and calcium, urinary excretion of both phosphate and calcium, and parathyroid hormone. Although these markers do not have ideal test characteristics individually to predict ectopic mineralisation risk, collectively, they can be utilized to help assess for risk of ectopic mineralisation. Of these biomarkers, serum phosphorus is considered the most predictive for ectopic mineralisation risk based on an analysis of ectopic mineralisation in the nonclinical toxicology assessment. Supra-physiological serum phosphorus levels above 8 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) were associated with ectopic mineralization in multiple species.</p><p>In order to minimize the risk for ectopic mineralization and other adverse events, the Applicant is aiming at Assessment report EMA/148319/2018 Page 108/130 targeting the treatment in the low end of the normal range of serum phosphate.</p><p>One child was reported to have a single serum phosphorus value above target range (5.2 mg/dL), but no subject in the paediatric population was reported to have a serum phosphorus level above the normal range (3.2-6.1 mg/dL). In study UX023-CL303, a total of seven (5.2%) burosumab treated subjects had a single serum phosphorus value above the upper limit of normal to data cut-off.</p><p>It should however be noted that serum phosphate was measured after at least 4-8 h of fasting. Serum phosphate fluctuates during the day in response to dietary intake, and it cannot be excluded that postprandial phosphate levels may exceed the upper reference limit. The Applicant has proposed a substudy of To manage the potential contribution of increased calcium on ectopic mineralization, the maintenance of normal levels of calcium in the serum and urine is aimed at during the studies.</p><p>During the studies, all subjects have been monitored with renal ultrasound and cardiac CT. The Applicant has proposed that recommendations for monitoring the development of nephrocalcinosis be amended to the SmPC.</p><p>Two cases of ectopic mineralisation of the heart were detected at week 88 among the children 5-12 years of age. In one of the cases, no ectopic mineralisation could be detected at Week 112. The other subject has not yet reached week 112. No ectopic mineralisation of the heart was detected in the younger children.</p><p>In the placebo-controlled adult study UX023-CL303, echocardiography reported ectopic mineralisation grade 1 in 5 subjects (7.6%) in the placebo group and 7 subjects (10.3%) in the KRN23 group at baseline. At Week 24, seven subjects (10.6%) in the placebo group and 1 subject (1.5%) in the treatment group had shifted from grade 0 to grade 1. No subject in either group had shifted from grade 1 to a higher grade but 1 subject (1.5%) in the placebo group and 3 subjects in the KRN23 (4.4%) had shifted from grade 1 to grade 0.</p><p>35% of the children in Study UX023-CL201, had signs of nephrocalcinosis at baseline renal ultrasound.</p><p>Through Week 64, 6 subjects (12%) had an increase, and 2 subjects (3.8%) had a decrease, of 1 point in renal ultrasound scores. Through Week 40, no event of nephrocalcinosis was reported in Study UX023-</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CL205.</head><p>In study UX023-CL303, 59.1% of the placebo group and 50% of the KRN23 group displayed nephrocalcinosis at baseline. In both groups, 12 subjects (placebo 18.1%, KRN23 17.6%) had worsening nephrocalcinosis by 1 point and 4 subjects (placebo 6.1%, KRN23 5.9%) were improved by 1 point.</p><p>Thus, even though there seems to be a tendency towards worsening of ectopic mineralisation over time in both children and adults, there was no difference between the placebo and treatment groups regarding nephrocalcinosis in the only placebo controlled study. There was also no trend for worsening ectopic mineralisation of the heart in the KRN23 group compared to placebo. So far, the anticipated problems with worsening ectopic mineralisation have been limited. It is however acknowledged that the length of time of exposure is not adequate to give full assurance over those events. The Applicant is required to address this in a post-authorisation study (PASS).</p><p>The absence of information on use of Crysvita in subjects with renal failure is considered a deficiency of the Week 12, and abnormal and potentially clinically significant at Week 40. QTcF and QTcB were normal (&lt;420 ms). The Applicant has clarified that the subject's PR-interval from 141 msec at baseline to 179 msec at</p><p>Week 40. Preliminary ECG results are available from the subject's Week 64 visit, and show a normal sinus rhythm and PR duration of 163 msec. This PR interval at Week 64 was classified as normal by the cardiologist reading the ECG as the subject had crossed into a new age-dependent reference range. The subject's first degree AV block was assessed as not clinically significant by the Investigator and first degree AV block is considered as not uncommon as an incidental finding in children. The Applicant will provide updated information on PR interval at the next first opportunity (in either the final study report or first PSUR). This is considered adequate.</p><p>Both in the paediatric and adult subsets, baseline elevation in serum amylase was seen in respectively 20.2% and 4.5% of the subjects. It was suggested this to be due to elevated salivary amylase, possibly related to the high frequency of dental issues in XLH. In seven children with elevated serum amylase levels, reflexive testing of amylase isoenzymes was conducted. The salivary isoenzyme accounted for the majority of amylase present in all cases. Furthermore, there were no meaningful differences observed between KRN23 and placebo groups regarding amylase levels. In the view of the CHMP these findings, in combination with all subjects being asymptomatic, therefore supported the view that the increase was due to elevated salivary amylase.</p><p>There were 9 subjects (19.2%) aged &gt; 50 years in the single-dose studies and 11 subjects (35.5%) in the adult repeat-dose studies KRN23 INT-001/002, UX023-CL203 and UX023-CL304. The age range was 21-68 years in the single-dose studies and 19-66 years in the adult repeat-dose studies. In the placebocontrolled study UX023-CL303, no subject was &gt; 65 years old. No studies were performed in elderly.</p><p>There are currently no data available on the use of KRN23 in pregnant women.</p><p>In both adult and paediatric populations, FGF23 is markedly increased by KRN23 treatment (almost 3000-fold in the paediatric study UX023-CL201, 1000-fold in Study UX023-CL205 (Week 24) and more than 800fold in the adult study UX023-CL203).</p><p>The increases in FGF23 levels following KRN23 treatment were considered likely to be due to a combination of increased expression and reduced clearance of FGF23. FGF23 concentrations increased in parallel with KRN23 concentrations, suggesting that binding of FGF23 prolonged its clearance from circulation as compared to native FGF23. Accumulation of antibody-ligand complexes in plasma is more likely to occur with smaller antibody-ligand complexes containing only one or two antibodies ("sustaining antibodies"), in contrast with rapid clearance of a ligand with antibodies that form large, cross-linked complexes ("clearing antibodies"). It is also possible that there is some compensatory increased production of FGF23 due to the rising phosphorus levels.</p><p>The levels of free FGF23 are also elevated compared to baseline.</p><p>Antibodies with high affinity and bivalent binding form more stable complexes with antigens whereas those with moderate affinity and monovalent binding tend to form less stable complexes with antigens. The burosumab-FGF23 complex belongs to the second category and is likely to give rise to some free FGF23 in circulation. However, due to the high molar excess of burosumab, any dissociated FGF23 in circulation is immediately re-associated with burosumab. This results in very low, if any, free FGF23 in the circulation and The clinical relevance of elevated PTH in patients with XLH is unclear. Data of the shift graphs suggest that exposure to Crysvita is associated with an increase in serum <ref type="bibr">[PTH]</ref>.The clinical relevance of this is not yet fully evaluated and is required to be addressed in a post-authorisation safety study (PASS). The information is also reflected in the SmPC and RMP.</p><p>In the adult primary safety dataset, two events of malignant tumours were recorded. In one subject, a suspect lung density, which later was diagnosed as a lung adenocarcinoma, was detected during the screening period, excluding the possibility of a treatment related event. In the other subject, a 55-year old woman, breast cancer was diagnosed on study day 270. The event was considered unlikely related to treatment. As breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide and as the age of 55 is not considered unusually low for breast cancer diagnosis, a relation between the event and the treatment cannot be established. Three adult subjects reported hypersensitivity TEAEs that were deemed related to study drug. One of the three cases led to discontinuation. After the data cut-off date, a serious, life-threatening event of angioedema was reported. The patient was concomitantly treated with lisinopril, and after approximately four weeks after withdrawal of the ACE-inhibitor, treatment with KRN23 could be continued without recurrence of the angioedema so far.</p><p>Hypersensitivity remains a potential risk with KRN23.</p><p>The presence of human anti-drug antibodies (ADA) was detected in four paediatric and in three adult subjects at baseline. At post-baseline, none of the paediatric and one of the adult subjects tested positive for ADA.</p><p>Exposition to KRN23 did not seem to increase the ADA positivity, and no indication of loss of efficacy was seen. The Applicant has since the MAA filing developed a new acid dissociation method. The applicant will retest all available samples from the clinical studies using this new validated method. The Applicant will provide updated information in the following PSUR updates.</p><p>No additional safety data is required in the context of this conditional marketing authorisation application.</p><p>However, long term safety will be assessed through a Post-Authorisation Safety Study (PASS) in Children with X-linked Hypophosphatemia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.2.">Conclusions on clinical safety</head><p>The safety profile of KRN23 is considered acceptable.</p><p>No fatalities were seen with the medicinal product so far, and the number of discontinuations due to AEs was low. The number of reported TEAEs in the only placebo-controlled study was comparable between the placebo-group and the treatment group. The number of TEAEs in the SOC Nervous system (principally headache, dizziness, and RLS) disorders was higher in the treatment group than in the placebo group.</p><p>Headache was also the most frequently reported TEAE among children 5-12 years. The most frequently reported related TEAE in both paediatric and adult subjects was mild injection site reaction (ISRs) that resolved in a few days in most cases.</p><p>The anticipated potential risk of ectopic mineralization has been of limited concern based on available data, but needs further monitoring by routine pharmacovigilance and is being further addressed in a PASS. There were no adverse events or loss of efficacy associated anti-drug antibodies so far, but the potential issue of immunogenicity and development of neutralizing antibodies remains.</p><p>The levels of total and free FGF23 were markedly increased in both paediatric and adult populations. So far, there are no indications that the elevated levels of free FGF23 have any biological activity. There are also indications in the literature linking elevated levels of FG23 to both carcinogenesis and cardiovascular mortality.

XLH is characterized by excess levels of circulating fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) that lead to increased urinary phosphate excretion, reduced 1,25(OH) 2 D synthesis, and subsequent hypophosphataemia. The features of the disorder can vary widely, even among affected members of the same family. Mildly affected individuals may have hypophosphataemia without other signs and symptoms. In children, the main clinical consequences of the disease are rickets, lower extremity skeletal deformities, gait abnormalities and loss of growth potential. In adulthood, the disease is associated with osteomalacia, musculoskeletal pain/stiffness and dental abscesses.</p><p>Burosumab (KRN23) is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits the excess biological activity of FGF23.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects</head><p>Paediatric studies:</p><p>The sample size is limited and no control group without active treatment KRN23 was included in the main paediatric study in children 5-12 years. Study UX023-CL201 (phase 2, dose finding study) is speaking in favor of a pharmacological effect (i.e. increase in s-phosphate, decrease in ALP) in this age group but the results on radiological and clinical endpoints are less convincing. Comparisons of (paediatric) open-label study results with external historical controls on conventional therapy should always be interpreted with caution.</p><p>In the study UX023-CL205, Week 40 data (PK, PD and safety) for all 13 enrolled patients age 1 to 4 years old had become available during the procedure. The pharmacodynamics results, RSS and RGI-C indicate similar response to that seen in children 5-12 years and the CHMP considers that efficacy results from age group 5-12 years can be extrapolated to ages 1 to 4 years old. In this study, length/standing height, expressed both as a percentile for age and gender and as Z scores, tended to decrease instead of (as would be expected) increase. The final study results at 64 weeks will be provided as part of a post authorisation commitment (specific obligation).</p><p>Although phase II studies have recruited subjects aged 1 to 12yrs, it is appreciated that those at the upper end of the age range encompass the age of 14yrs (the company states that 9 subjects reached 14yrs). A positive benefit/risk balance has not been shown in adults (application for this indication was withdrawn by the applicant during the procedure) or in adolescents with mature skeletons (not included in studies). The reasoned extrapolation to adolescents with growing skeletons without a strict upper age limit is based on shared mechanism of action and aim of therapy and improved x-ray appearance of affected growing bones after longer term exposure to burosumab. Only children with radiological evidence of bone disease have been included in the clinical studies so far and the indication wording is reflecting this accordingly.</p><p>The RSS scoring methodology has previously been used for the assessment of the severity of nutritional rickets. There is no golden standard method of scoring radiological changes in XLH. The Applicant has used RSS scale in study UX023-CL201 and for historical controls in UX023-CL002.</p><p>In study UX023-CL201, a borderline increase in growth velocity was seen from 5.35 to 5.91 cm/year from baseline to week 64 as well as improvement in standing height Z score +0.15 (p&lt;0.0001). The mean improvement in 6MWT was +47 m overall (p&lt;0.001) and +77 m in those with &lt;80% predicted at baseline (p&lt;0.0001). The magnitude of effect and clinical relevance is difficult to interpret in paediatric patients with the current study design regarding variables growth, 6 MWT, functional disability and pain. A biological variation and maturation with age has not been established for this group of subjects. Therefore, no claims on these parameters were included in the SmPC 5.1, pending final results from the confirmatory randomized phase 3 study due in 2019 (EU RMP category 2 study UX023-CL301as specific obligation of marketing authorization).</p><p>A number of interim analyses were performed at various time-points in study UX023-CL201. They were descriptive in nature but have seemingly had an impact on study conduct and planned analyses (increased sample size, revised inclusion criteria, cut-off for RSS subgroup analyses). The study protocol was amended 5</p><p>times. In addition, results from this study have seemingly been presented at medical conferences (i.e. before data cut-off for the current analyses) and eventually also been published. There were therefore some concerns regarding the dissemination of results, their potential impact on the credibility of the study results that follow and potential impact on study integrity; however, it was considered unlikely to change significantly the conclusions from the studies.</p><p>Change in the RSS scale was the primary radiological endpoint of the study. This scale was developed for nutritional rickets and not for XLH. A single rater (inventor of the scale) did all RSS assessments in the study.</p><p>During the procedure, the images have been re-rated by 2 other independent raters on request of the CHMP and results based on these assessments are supportive for treatment effect in these parameters.</p><p>Long-term efficacy beyond 64 weeks of KRN23 is unknown.</p><p>The proposed posology in the SmPC is not in line with the posology used in the main paediatric study UX023-CL201 (that was also a dose finding study, starting from doses as low as 0.1mg/kg) but the proposed starting dose reflects the therapeutic dose level (0.8mg/kg Q2W) in study UX023-CL201. Thereafter, individual titration is needed for achieving low normal phosphate levels and this should be performed according to the phosphate levels as stated in the SmPC. This dosing strategy has also been implemented in paediatric study UX023-CL205 through 24 weeks using a starting dose of 0.8 mg/kg Q2W. From a safety point of view, a starting dose of 0.4 mg/kg is now being advised in the SmPC at this time as this was the lowest maintenance dose in study UX023-CL201. The dose is proposed to be titrated stepwise every four weeks with 0.4 mg/kg; i.e dose of 0.8 mg/kg is achieved already after four weeks of treatment. This rather conservative approach to dose titration may change after additional safety results from from the confirmatory randomized phase 3 study are being received in 2019 (EU RMP category 2 study UX023-CL301as specific obligation of marketing authorization).</p><p>In children 5-12 years, ectopic mineralization (EM) of the heart was Grade 0 for all 52 subjects at Baseline and for all post-baseline assessments except for EM Grade 1/8 for two subjects at Week 88. One of these subjects had returned to EM Grade 0 at Week 112, and the other had no further assessments as of the data cut off. In children 1-4 years, no event of EM has been reported up to Week 40.</p><p>In the placebo-controlled adult study, EM of the heart was detected in 5 subjects (7.6%) in the placebo group and 7 subjects (10.3%) in the burosumab group at baseline. At Week 24, seven subjects (10.6%) in the placebo group and 1 subject (1.5%) had shifted from grade 0 to grade 1. 1 subject (1.5%) in the placebo group and 3 subjects in the KRN23 (4.4%) had shifted from grade 1 to grade 0.</p><p>35% of the children 5-12 years had signs of nephrocalcinosis at baseline renal ultrasound. Through Week 64, 6 subjects (12%) had a worsening and 2 subjects had an augmentation of the renal ultrasound scores. No case of nephrocalcinosis has been reported in children 1-4 years up to week 40.</p><p>In the placebo controlled adult study, 59.1% of the placebo group and 50% of the KRN23 group displayed nephrocalcinosis at baseline. In both groups, 12 subjects (placebo 18.1%, KRN23 17.6%) had worsening nephrocalcinosis and 4 subjects (placebo 6.1%, KRN23 5.9%) were improved.</p><p>Among the younger children, no EM or nephrocalcinosis have been reported at data cut-off.</p><p>In both adult and paediatric populations, FGF23 is markedly increased by burosumab treatment (almost 3000-fold in the paediatric study UX023-CL201 and more than 800-fold in the adult study UX023-CL203).</p><p>This is considered to be a result of both increased expression and reduced clearance of FGF23 ("sustaining antibodies"). Moreover, in both the adult study and children 1-4 years, the levels of free FGF23 were elevated 10-20-fold compared to baseline. In children 5-12 years, free FGF23 was not collected until Week 38. It is plausible that the elevated levels of free FGF-23 are caused by an in vitro artefact. The feasibility of measuring serum [free FGF23] without artefact, for example by use of equilibrium dialysis prior to measurement, is foreseen to be investigated by the MAH post approval.</p><p>Data of the shift graphs suggest that exposure to burosumab is associated with an increase in serum PTH.</p><p>Two subjects 5-12 years had serum iPTH concentrations &gt;2 x upper level of normal (ULN) at Screening or Baseline visits. Both subjects showed decreases in serum iPTH concentration over time. All subjects in the study but four had a maximum PTH value higher than baseline, but there was no consistent rise in PTH levels over time. In the adult placebo controlled study, the mean serum iPTH concentration was above the ULN (&gt; 72 pg/mL) in both treatment groups at baseline. As in children, there was no consistent rise in PTH levels over time. At week 24, there was a trend to lower PTH in the treatment group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects</head><p>At this time point, there are no results available from placebo-controlled (or conservative treatment controlled) studies in children. Without these data, it is very difficult to distinguish any adverse events from the symptoms of the underlying disease or other events naturally occurring in XLH population. However, interim data from the double blind phase (up to week 24) of the placebo controlled adult study UX02-CL303 are available.</p><p>Hyperphosphataemia is an anticipated unfavourable effect of Crysvita due to the mechanism of action of the product. The serum phosphate was closely monitored in the clinical studies and this will be needed also in clinical practice. This is reflected in the SmPC.</p><p>So far, only a limited number of events of hyperphosphataemia have been reported. However, serum phosphate was regularly determined in fasting subjects throughout the studies. Serum phosphate fluctuates during the day in response to dietary intake, and it cannot be excluded that post-prandial phosphate levels Ectopic mineralization is listed as a potential risk, possibly associated with hyperphosphataemia. During the studies, all subjects have been monitored with renal ultrasound and cardiac CT. Worsening of ectopic mineralisation seems to be a limited problem so far. However, the number of subjects treated and the observational time are still limited. The company has proposed a post-authorisation safety study (PASS), which was accepted as part of the RMP, evaluating the long term safety of the product, including ectopic mineralisation. Recommendations for monitoring of nephrocalcinosis are included in the SmPC.</p><p>Subjects with nephrocalcinosis may be at risk of developing chronic renal failure. The absence of information on use of Crysvita in subjects with renal failure is considered a deficiency of the current clinical development programme. The company has proposed that data on subjects with mild to moderate renal failure will be collected in the required PASS (category 3 study of the RMP).</p><p>Of initial concern was the relevance of elevated serum levels of free FGF23. As burosumab is an antibody of moderate affinity and monovalent binding, the burosumab-FGF23 complex is less stable and is likely to give rise to some free FGF23 in circulation. However, due to the high molar excess of burosumab, any dissociated FGF23 in circulation is immediately re-associated with burosumab. This therefore is likely to result in very low, if any, free FGF23 in the circulation and reduced availability for binding to its downstream receptor Moreover, members of the FGF-family have, for example, been linked to carcinogenesis, and elevated levels of FGF23 have been linked to greater risks of LVH and mortality, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease. The observation time may not be enough for excluding negative effects of long term effects of elevated levels of free FGF23.</p><p>To further evaluate both levels of free FGF23 in serum and long-term effects of putatively elevated levels of FGF23, the Applicant plans to investigate the level of the unbound FGF23 by measurement in the presence of study drug, perform feasibility experiments of the equilibrium dialysis approach, and investigate alternative approaches if necessary, and will give a progress update and a more detailed timeline at the first PSUR.</p><p>In Week 40 data from Study UX023-CL205, one subject was reported to have a normal ECG at baseline, abnormal and clinically insignificant at Week 12, and abnormal and potentially clinically significant at Week 40 (first degree AV block). QTcF and QTcB were normal (&lt;420 ms). The subject's first degree AV block was assessed as not clinically significant by the Investigator and the Applicant agrees with this assessment as first degree AV block is not uncommonly reported as an incidental finding in children. The Applicant will provide further information in either the final study report or first PSUR, whichever comes first. This is considered adequate.</p><p>The clinical relevance of elevated PTH in patients with XLH is unclear. This will be addressed in the required PASS (category 3 study of the RMP).</p><p>Assessment report EMA/148319/2018 Page 125/130 Baseline FGF23 Q2W 152 pg/mL, Q4W 161 pg/mL. FGF23 is increased more than 1900fold in Q4 and more than 3000-fold in Q2. Free FGF23 levels were presented and commented only for adult subjects.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.1.">Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects</head><p>Low serum phosphate is the main laboratory abnormality of XLH. The paediatric study has demonstrated an increase in serum phosphate and TmP/GFR in treated subjects, with a more stable profile over time with Q2 dosing compared to Q4. A tendency to superior clinical outcomes supports the Q2 dosing. The radiographic evaluation in XLH are considered as a clinically relevant outcome, however, the validation of these scores in XLH is not complete. Statistically significant improvements from baseline do not necessarily mean clinical relevance. Furthermore, it is not easy to estimate the magnitude of efficacy in the paediatric study UX023-CL201 as all patients received the experimental treatment and with 64 weeks available data. However, the effect on serum phosphate levels are further supportive of a benefit of the treatment.</p><p>The current paediatric studies have included only children with radiographic evidence of bone disease and ongoing studies have stepwise been changed towards including only more severely affected patients. Very mildly affected individuals with XLH may have hypophosphataemia without other signs and symptoms throughout the life. Consequentially, the agreed wording in the indication restricts the intended use to Xlinked hypophosphataemia with radiographic evidence of bone disease.</p><p>Injection site reactions were mostly mild in severity and nearly all resolved within 3 days. In the placebo controlled adult study, adverse events in the SOC Nervous system disorders (i.e. headache, dizziness, and RLS) were more common in the burosumab group. There were no treatment discontinuations in the paediatric studies. In the adult studies, 3 subjects discontinued treatment due to adverse events; however, two of those resumed treatment.</p><p>It is considered crucial to avoid hyperphosphataemia, as high serum phosphate is linked to the development of ectopic mineralisation and is considered a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. So far, hyperphosphataemia has been a limited problem, but it remains a concern that there is no data on serum phosphate levels in a non-fasting state. The company has committed to initiate a study on this issue. During the clinical studies, serum phosphate has been targeted in the lower end of the age-adjusted reference range. A similar advice is included in the SmPC, together with recommendations on how to monitor serum phosphate.</p><p>Ectopic mineralisation of the heart and/or kidney is considered an important potential safety risk. This has been of limited concern based on available data, but the time of exposure is not adequate to give full assurance regarding those events. Recommendation on monitoring nephrocalcinosis has been included in the SmPC, and the Applicant has proposed a long term post-authorisation safety study to address such safety issues.</p><p>It is presently unknown whether there are any unfavourable long term effects of the elevated FGF23-levels.</p><p>To further evaluate both levels of free FGF23 in serum and long-term effects of putatively elevated levels of FGF23, the Applicant plans to investigate the level of the unbound FGF23 by measurement in the presence of study drug, perform feasibility experiments of the equilibrium dialysis approach, and investigate alternative approaches if necessary, and will give a progress update and a more detailed timeline at the first PSUR.</p><p>The Applicant has withdrawn the adult indication and requests conditional approval to be limited to the paediatric population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.2.">Balance of benefits and risks</head><p>In the paediatric population 5-12 years, positive findings on serum phosphate levels in the Q2 dosing group were supported by at least favourable trends in all specified efficacy measures in patients with severe XLH rickets. In children 1-4 years, available pharmacodynamics and radiological data indicate similar response than for older children. Some subjects reached 14years of age during the studies. The reasoned extrapolation to adolescents with growing skeletons without a strict upper age limit is based on shared mechanism of action and aim of therapy as well as improved x-ray appearance seen in affected growing bones after longer term exposure.</p><p>Potential safety concerns have been identified, mainly hyperphosphataemia, ectopic mineralisation and elevated levels of free and total FGF23, but so far, these anticipated issues have been of limited concern based on available data. No unexpected adverse events have emerged. There were no deaths in any of the studies.</p><p>Data submitted for this application included two phase 2 studies in the paediatric population, which showed an improvement with burosumab of relevant metabolic parameters, including serum phosphate levels, of radiological endpoints related to the severity of rickets, and and clinical endpoints relevant for XLH. However, the the sample size and length of studies were limited. Furthermore, no control group without active treatment was included and therefore the comparison of such (paediatric) open-label study results with external historical controls on conventional therapy did not allow a fully comprehensive assessment of safety and efficacy.</p><p>As this is an orphan product intended for the treatment of a seriously debilitating disease (leading to defective bone mineralisation that manifests as rickets and osteomalacia with subsequent bowing of the leg, physical disability, and decreased height, and is also associated with pain, stiffness, fatigue, and functional limitations) the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation, and agreed that the applicant should complete the following studies as specific obligations for such a Conditional Marketing Authorisation (see also clinical efficacy section for more details on these studies):</p><p>UX023 All 3 studies had completed recruitment already at time of submission of this procedure, and were well advanced. Therefore it is likely that comprehensive data can be provided in the pre-specified timeframe.</p><p>Study UX023-CL301 is a randomized controlled phase 3 study, includes relevant efficacy outcome parameters, and is expected to confirm the positive benefit/risk profile observed in the phase 2 studies; this study has also shown a high degree of adherence to study treatment. The data from all 3 studies are planned to be submitted in or before 2020.</p><p>In summary, treatment of XLH with burosumab reduces the loss of phosphate from the kidney, improves abnormally low serum phosphate concentrations and other metabolic changes, and reduces the severity of rickets as shown in x-rays. Also, treatment with burosumab was not associated with major safety concerns.</p><p>No other specific and fully satisfactory treatment options for XLH are available. Therefore, while fully comprehensive data is not yet available, the benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.</p></div>

A murine anti-FGF23 antibody was used to characterize the PD effects and mode of action of inhibiting FGF23 in Hyp mice. Juvenile male Hyp mice treated with 4 weekly SC doses (4 or 16 mg/kg) of a murine anti-FGF23 Ab had significantly elevated serum phosphate and 1,25(OH) 2 D levels compared with those of control animals. Anti-FGF23 Ab treatment improved growth retardation and elongation of femoral and tibial bone.

This might indicate that the method is not suitable for detecting ADA in dosed patients. The Applicant has therefore developed a new acid dissociation method, which was adequately validated, except that establishment of cut-points and other characteristics was based on normal human plasma samples and not patient plasma. This is acceptable, given the low number of patients included in studies, however, if possible the Applicant is recommended to verify the cut points using patient sera. The new method improved the drug tolerance considerable and it is now well above the through levels of burosumab in all clinical studies. The applicant plans to retest all available samples from clinical studies using the new validated method, and to submit the results in a yearly update. Since the currently available data with the present ADA immunogenicity of burosumab, it is considered acceptable that the results of the retesting of clinical samples are submitted post-approval.</figDesc><table><row><cell>method indicate low</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Assessment report</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>EMA/148319/2018</cell><cell>Page 40/130</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

Growth velocity was calculated as the change in growth between intervals on an annualized basis and z-factors calculated for an additional age and gender adjusted analysis of growth rate. Functional disability and pain (Pediatric Orthopedic Society of North America -Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument [POSNA-PODCI])The POSNA-PODCI was developed to measure the functional health of paediatric and adolescent patients with a variety of musculoskeletal disorders. The questionnaire yields a global function score, a happiness score, and four functional assessment scores (upper extremity functioning, transfers and basic mobility, sports and physical functioning, and comfort/pain). Raw, mean, standardized, and normative scores were calculated for each scale. The global function score is an average of the four functional scores. Standardized scores range from 0 to 100, with 0 representing the poorest outcome or worst health and 100 the best possible outcome or best health. Normative scores were calculated so that higher scores indicate better functioning. All scores were referenced to the general, healthy population with a normative mean score of 50 and a standard deviation of 10.Renal phosphate reabsorption is impaired in patients with XLH due to excess FGF23. TmP/GFR is a measure of renal phosphate reabsorption, the primary mechanism by which FGF23 regulates phosphate homeostasis by comparing the fractional absorption of phosphate relative to the estimated rate of glomerular filtration, which provides insight into the degree to which phosphate is being reabsorbed relative to the amount of glomerular filtrate.</figDesc><table><row><cell>General Safety Endpoints</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>• All adverse events</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="2">• Events to monitor: Injection site reaction (High-Level Term), Hypersensitivity, Hyperphosphataemia,</cell></row><row><cell>Ectopic mineralization, Gastrointestinal events, Restless legs syndrome</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>• Chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis parameters: Serum 25(OH)D, FGF23 (total), GFR</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>• Human anti-human antibody (HAHA)</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>• Vital signs Physical exams, Pregnancy tests, Concomitant medications</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Ectopic Mineralization Endpoints</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="2">• Renal ultrasound, ECG, ECHO, Serum calcium, Urinary calcium excretion rate, Serum iPTH, Serum</cell></row><row><cell>creatinine</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Study Key PD Measures</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>• Serum phosphorus, Serum 1,25(OH)2D, TmP/GFR</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Secondary PD measures</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="2">• Urinary phosphorus, TRP, Fractional Excretion of Phosphorus (FEP), Bone Biomarkers (P1NP, CTx, ALP,</cell></row><row><cell>BALP)</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Pharmacokinetic Endpoint</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>• Serum pre-dose concentrations of KRN23 Efficacy Endpoints</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Assessment report</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>EMA/148319/2018</cell><cell>Page 47/130</cell></row></table><note>• Walking Ability (Six-minute Walk Test [6MWT]) The 6MWT was administered by a trained clinician in accordance with general principles set forth in the American Thoracic Society guidelines (ATS 2002) •Randomisation Within each initial dose cohort, subjects were randomised 1:1 to the Q2W or to the Q4W regimen via an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) based on a randomisation schedule developed by an independent</note></figure>

A total of 36% subjects in the paediatric study had evidence of nephrocalcinosis at baseline and are at risk of developing chronic renal failure.

This is accepted. Data on subjects with mild to moderate renal failure will be collected in the required PASS.Data submitted by the company give reassurance [i.e. an effect is not detected] regarding vital parameters (heart rate, blood pressure and ECG QTcF parameters).

The choice of the specific burosumab antibody KRN23 was to select an intermediate binding affinity and not one with maximal affinity since this helps assure that FGF23 levels do not decrease to zero. The Applicant's explanation to the elevated levels of total FGF23 is accepted. The company's argument regarding the elevated levels of free FGF23 is considered plausible.Regarding long-term risks, elevated levels of FGF23 have been linked to greater risks of LVH and mortality, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease. In the UX023-CL303 study, left ventricular mass index was stable in 60 patients in the burosumab group in which measured total and free FGF23 increase while on treatment. Also in study in the UX023-CL203, no increase in left ventricular mass index was seen in 19 subjects treated with burosumab for 48 weeks. It should be noted, however, that the observation time may not be enough for excluding negative effects on the heart in any of the studies.To further evaluate both levels of free FGF23 in serum and long-term effects of putatively elevated levels of FGF23, the Applicant plans to investigate the level of the unbound FGF23 by measurement in the presence of study drug, perform feasibility experiments of the equilibrium dialysis approach, and investigate alternative approaches if necessary, and will give a progress update and a more detailed timeline at the first PSUR.The relationship between PTH and FGF23 is complex, as summarized by Blau and Collins (Reviews inEndocrine and Metabolic Disorders June 2015, Volume 16, pp 165-174). Animal and in vitro data suggests that FGF23 directly inhibits PTH synthesis and secretion. On the other hand, FGF23 excess disorders such as TIO and XLH do not demonstrate inhibition of PTH synthesis and secretion in the setting of markedly elevated FGF23. Contrary, signs of secondary hyperparathyroidism can regularly be detected in XLH patients treated with phosphate and/or vitamin D. There are also reports on elevated PTH levels in untreated patients with XLH (please refer to a review by Schmitt and Mehls; Pediatric Nephrology, May 2004, Volume 19, pp 473-477).</figDesc><table><row><cell>reduced availability for</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Assessment report</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>EMA/148319/2018</cell><cell>Page 110/130</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>
