Furthermore, the new pharmacovigilance system that FDA is required to establish under section 505(k)(3) of the FDCA will not be sufficient to assess these serious risks.</p><p>Therefore, based on appropriate scientific data, FDA has determined that you are required to conduct the following:</p><p>PMR #1 A study in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients treated with Humira (adalimumab) in which you will bank tissue or blood samples (as appropriate) and then analyze them to identify genetic mutations and other biomarkers that predispose these patients to developing Hepatosplenic T-Cell Lymphoma (HSTCL).</p><p>The timetable you submitted on September 26, 2012 states that you will conduct this study according to the following schedule:</p><p>Final Protocol Submission: 09/2013 Study Completion: 09/2019 Final Report Submission: 09/2020 PMR #2: A multi-center observational study of Humira (adalimumab) in adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis treated in a routine clinical setting, to assess the long-term safety as measured by the incidence of opportunistic infections and malignancies. Long-term effectiveness should be assessed as a secondary goal. The proposed study should follow patients for a period of at least 10 years from time of enrollment in order to ascertain adverse events with longer latency periods such as malignancies. The primary analysis is to summarize safety data for patients on adalimumab and patients on non-biologic immunomodulator therapy. The study should be adequately sized to sufficiently detect a doubling of the risk of lymphoma events in each treatment group. A secondary analysis is to summarize safety data for patients on adalimumab and patients on the combination of adalimumab and non-biologic immunomodulator therapy. In addition, the study is to document and evaluate effects of withdrawal and re <ref type="bibr">BLA 125057/232 Page 4</ref> treatment with adalimumab and "switching" with other tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-blockers or biologics.</p><p>The timetable you submitted on September 26, 2012, states that you will conduct this study according to the following schedule:</p><p>Final Protocol Submission: <ref type="bibr">06/2013</ref><ref type="bibr">Study Completion: 12/2027</ref><ref type="bibr">Final Report Submission: 12/2029</ref> PMR #3 Develop, qualify, and implement improved validated anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) assays with reduced sensitivity to product interference. Until assays have been developed and validated, patient blood samples collected from clinical studies and trials should be banked under appropriate storage conditions. You will provide assay SOPs, validation protocols, and validation final reports that include data demonstrating that the assay is specific, sensitive and reproducible, and capable of sensitively detecting AAA responses in the presence of adalimumab levels that are expected to be present at the time of patient sampling.</p><p>The timetable you submitted on September 26, 2012, states that you will conduct this study according to the following schedule:</p><p>Final Report Submission: 12/2013 PMR #4 Utilizing a validated AAA assay as described in PMR #3 above, you should measure and analyze the immunogenicity profile based on post-dose patient samples from completed study M10-223, the trial conducted under PMR #5, the trial conducted under PMR #6, and the trial conducted under PMC #7.</p><p>The timetable you submitted on September 26, 2012, states that you will conduct this study according to the following schedule:</p><p>Final Protocol Submission: 09/2013 Study Completion: 03/2018 Final Report Submission: 03/2019</p><p>Finally, we have determined that only a clinical trial (rather than a nonclinical or observational study) will be sufficient to assess a known risk of serious adverse events, including opportunistic infections and malignancies, in patients receiving higher doses of adalimumab.</p><p>Therefore, based on appropriate scientific data, FDA has determined that you are required to conduct the following:</p><p>BLA 125057/232 Page 5 PMR #5 Conduct a trial in moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis patients to evaluate the safety of induction regimens of adalimumab at doses higher than 160/80 mg. In this trial, the efficacy of Humira (adalimumab) should also be assessed, both during induction treatment as well as during continued treatment after induction, and pharmacokinetic measurements should be conducted for exposure-response analysis. In this trial, collecting samples for immunogenicity testing (utilizing a validated anti-adalimumab antibody assay as described in PMR #3 above) and conducting analyses of the impact of immunogenicity on safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy is important. The protocol should be agreed upon by the agency prior to the initiation of the trial.</p><p>The timetable you submitted on September 26, 2012, states that you will conduct this trial according to the following schedule:</p><p>Final Protocol Submission: 09/2013 Trial Completion: 03/2018 Final Report Submission: 03/2019 PMR #6 A safety and pharmacokinetic trial as a sub-study of the trial described in PMR #5 above to evaluate trough concentrations of adalimumab and antibody levels (utilizing a validated anti-adalimumab antibody assay as described in PMR #3 above) at the time of loss of clinical remission in patients whose physicians plan to escalate the dose (e.g., decrease the dosing interval to weekly or increase the dosage) in response to loss of remission. Trough concentrations will be evaluated to determine whether patients who have low adalimumab exposures benefit from dose escalation without increasing risk of serious adverse events. The protocol should be agreed upon by the agency prior to initiation of the trial.</p><p>The timetable you submitted on September 26, 2012, states that you will conduct this trial according to the following schedule: Section 505(o)(3)(E)(ii) of the FDCA requires you to report periodically on the status of any study or clinical trial required under this section. This section also requires you to periodically report to FDA on the status of any study or clinical trial otherwise undertaken to investigate a BLA 125057/232 Page 6 safety issue. Section 506B of the FDCA, as well as 21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(vii) requires you to report annually on the status of any postmarketing commitments or required studies or clinical trials.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Final</formula><p>FDA will consider the submission of your annual report under section 506B and 21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(vii) to satisfy the periodic reporting requirement under section 505(o)(3)(E)(ii) provided that you include the elements listed in 505(o) and 21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(vii). We remind you that to comply with 505(o), your annual report must also include a report on the status of any study or clinical trial otherwise undertaken to investigate a safety issue. Failure to submit an annual report for studies or clinical trials required under 505(o) on the date required will be considered a violation of FDCA section 505(o)(3)(E)(ii) and could result in enforcement action.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Serious Infections</head><p>Patients treated with HUMIRA are at increased risk for developing serious infections involving various organ systems and sites that may lead to hospitalization or death [see <ref type="bibr">Boxed Warning]</ref>. Opportunistic infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, parasitic, or other opportunistic pathogens including aspergillosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, legionellosis, listeriosis, pneumocystosis and tuberculosis have been reported with TNF blockers. Patients have frequently presented with disseminated rather than localized disease.</p><p>The concomitant use of a TNF blocker and abatacept or anakinra was associated with a higher risk of serious infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); therefore, the concomitant use of HUMIRA and these biologic products is not recommended in the treatment of patients with RA [see <ref type="bibr">Warnings and Precautions (5.7,</ref><ref type="bibr">5.11) and Drug Interactions (7.2)</ref>].</p><p>Treatment with HUMIRA should not be initiated in patients with an active infection, including localized infections. Patients greater than 65 years of age, patients with co-morbid conditions and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants (such as corticosteroids or methotrexate), may be at greater risk of infection. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating therapy in patients:</p><p> with chronic or recurrent infection;</p><p> who have been exposed to tuberculosis;</p><p> with a history of an opportunistic infection;  who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis; or  with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tuberculosis</head><p>Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis or new tuberculosis infections have been observed in patients receiving HUMIRA, including patients who have previously received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis. Evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating HUMIRA and periodically during therapy.</p><p>Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF blocking agents has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Prior to initiating HUMIRA, assess if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed; and consider an induration of ≥ 5 mm a positive tuberculin skin test result, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG).</p><p>Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of HUMIRA in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.</p><p>Strongly consider tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis in patients who develop a new infection during HUMIRA treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Monitoring</head><p>Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with HUMIRA, including the development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with HUMIRA.</p><p>Discontinue HUMIRA if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. For a patient who develops a new infection during treatment with HUMIRA, closely monitor them, perform a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Invasive Fungal Infections</head><p>If patients develop a serious systemic illness and they reside or travel in regions where mycoses are endemic, consider invasive fungal infection in the differential diagnosis. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider appropriate empiric antifungal therapy, taking into account both the risk for severe fungal infection and the risks of antifungal therapy, while a diagnostic workup is being performed. To aid in the management of such patients, consider consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Malignancies</head><p>Consider the risks and benefits of TNF-blocker treatment including HUMIRA prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing a TNF blocker in patients who develop a malignancy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Malignancies in Adults</head><p>In the controlled portions of clinical trials of some TNF-blockers, including HUMIRA, more cases of malignancies have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated adult patients compared to control-treated adult patients. During the controlled portions of 34 global HUMIRA clinical trials in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and plaque psoriasis (Ps), malignancies, other than non-melanoma (basal cell and squamous cell) skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 0.6 (0.38, 0.91) per 100 patient-years among 7304 HUMIRA-treated patients versus a rate of 0.6 (0.30, 1.03) per 100 patient-years among 4232 controltreated patients (median duration of treatment of 4 months for HUMIRA-treated patients and 4 months for control-treated patients). In 47 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of HUMIRA in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, and Ps, the most frequently observed malignancies, other than lymphoma and NMSC, were breast, colon, prostate, lung, and melanoma. The malignancies in HUMIRA-treated patients in the controlled and uncontrolled portions of the studies were similar in type and number to what would be expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race). <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">1</ref> In controlled trials of other TNF blockers in adult patients at higher risk for malignancies (i.e., patients with COPD with a significant smoking history and cyclophosphamide-treated patients with Wegener's granulomatosis), a greater portion of malignancies occurred in the TNF blocker group compared to the control group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer</head><p>During the controlled portions of 34 global HUMIRA clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, and Ps, the rate (95% confidence interval) of NMSC was 0.7 (0.49, 1.08) per 100 patient-years among HUMIRA-treated patients and 0.2 (0.08, 0.59) per 100 patient-years among control-treated patients. Examine all patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of prior prolonged immunosuppressant therapy or psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment for the presence of NMSC prior to and during treatment with HUMIRA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lymphoma and Leukemia</head><p>In the controlled portions of clinical trials of all the TNF-blockers in adults, more cases of lymphoma have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated patients compared to control-treated patients. In the controlled portions of 34 global HUMIRA clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC and Ps, 3 lymphomas occurred among 7304 HUMIRA-treated patients versus 1 among 4232 control-treated patients. In 47 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of HUMIRA in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC and Ps with a median duration of approximately 0.6 years, including 23,036 patients and over 34,000 patientyears of HUMIRA, the observed rate of lymphomas was approximately 0.11 per 100 patient-years. This is approximately 3-fold higher than expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race). <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">1</ref> Rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of HUMIRA cannot be compared to rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of other TNF blockers and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population. Patients with RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly those with highly active disease and/or chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies, may be at a higher risk (up to several fold) than the general population for the development of lymphoma, even in the absence of TNF blockers. Post-marketing cases of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported in association with TNF-blocker use in RA and other indications. Even in the absence of TNF-blocker therapy, patients with RA may be at a higher risk (approximately 2-fold) than the general population for the development of leukemia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Malignancies in Pediatric Patients and Young Adults</head><p>Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blockers (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), of which HUMIRA is a member [see <ref type="bibr">Boxed Warning]</ref>. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas, including Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The other cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with immunosuppression and malignancies that are not usually observed in children and adolescents. The malignancies occurred after a median of 30 months of therapy (range 1 to 84 months). Most of the patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants. These cases were reported post-marketing and are derived from a variety of sources including registries and spontaneous postmarketing reports.</p><p>Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including HUMIRA [see Boxed Warning]. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases has occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all of these patients had received treatment with the immunosuppressants azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Hypersensitivity Reactions</head><p>In postmarketing experience, anaphylaxis and angioneurotic edema have been reported rarely following HUMIRA administration. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reaction occurs, immediately discontinue administration of HUMIRA and institute appropriate therapy. In clinical trials of HUMIRA in adults, allergic reactions overall (e.g., allergic rash, anaphylactoid reaction, fixed drug reaction, non-specified drug reaction, urticaria) have been observed in approximately 1% of patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation</head><p>Use of TNF blockers, including HUMIRA, may increase the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus. In some instances, HBV reactivation occurring in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy has been fatal. The majority of these reports have occurred in patients concomitantly receiving other medications that suppress the immune system, which may also contribute to HBV reactivation. Evaluate patients at risk for HBV infection for prior evidence of HBV infection before initiating TNF blocker therapy. Exercise caution in prescribing TNF blockers for patients identified as carriers of HBV. Adequate data are not available on the safety or efficacy of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy to prevent HBV reactivation. For patients who are carriers of HBV and require treatment with TNF blockers, closely monitor such patients for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. In patients who develop HBV reactivation, stop HUMIRA and initiate effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment. The safety of resuming TNF blocker therapy after HBV reactivation is controlled is not known. Therefore, exercise caution when considering resumption of HUMIRA therapy in this situation and monitor patients closely.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Neurologic Reactions</head><p>Use of TNF blocking agents, including HUMIRA, has been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disease, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disease, including Guillain-Barré syndrome. Exercise caution in considering the use of HUMIRA in patients with preexisting or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6">Hematological Reactions</head><p>Rare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anemia have been reported with TNF blocking agents. Adverse reactions of the hematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g., thrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been infrequently reported with HUMIRA. The causal relationship of these reports to HUMIRA remains unclear. Advise all patients to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or infection (e.g., persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on HUMIRA. Consider discontinuation of HUMIRA therapy in patients with confirmed significant hematologic abnormalities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7">Use with Anakinra</head><p>Concurrent use of anakinra (an interleukin-1 antagonist) and another TNF-blocker, was associated with a greater proportion of serious infections and neutropenia and no added benefit compared with the TNF-blocker alone in patients with RA. Therefore, the combination of HUMIRA and anakinra is not recommended [see Drug <ref type="bibr">Interactions (7.2)</ref>].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.8">Heart Failure</head><p>Cases of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) and new onset CHF have been reported with TNF blockers. Cases of worsening CHF have also been observed with HUMIRA. HUMIRA has not been formally studied in patients with CHF; however, in clinical trials of another TNF blocker, a higher rate of serious CHFrelated adverse reactions was observed. Exercise caution when using HUMIRA in patients who have heart failure and monitor them carefully.</p></div>

Similar proportions of patients developed protective levels of anti-influenza antibodies between HUMIRA and placebo treatment groups; however, titers in aggregate to influenza antigens were moderately lower in patients receiving HUMIRA. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Patients on HUMIRA may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving HUMIRA.</p><p>It is recommended that JIA patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating HUMIRA therapy.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Clinical Trials Experience</head><p>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying and controlled conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population in clinical practice.</p><p>The most common adverse reaction with HUMIRA was injection site reactions. In placebo-controlled trials, 20% of patients treated with HUMIRA developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 14% of patients receiving placebo. Most injection site reactions were described as mild and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation.</p><p>The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of studies in patients with RA (i.e., Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III and RA-IV) was 7% for patients taking HUMIRA and 4% for placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of HUMIRA in these RA studies were clinical flare reaction (0.7%), rash (0.3%) and pneumonia (0.3%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Infections</head><p>In the controlled portions of the 34 global HUMIRA clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC and Ps, the rate of serious infections was 4.6 per 100 patient-years in 7304 HUMIRA-treated patients versus a rate of 3.1 per 100 patient-years in 4232 control-treated patients. Serious infections observed included pneumonia, septic arthritis, prosthetic and post-surgical infections, erysipelas, cellulitis, diverticulitis, and pyelonephritis [see <ref type="bibr">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</ref>].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tuberculosis and Opportunistic Infections</head><p>In 47 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC and Ps that included 23,036 HUMIRA-treated patients, the rate of reported active tuberculosis was 0.22 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.08 per 100 patient-years. In a subgroup of 9396 U.S. and Canadian HUMIRA-treated patients, the rate of reported active TB was 0.07 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.08 per 100 patient-years. These trials included reports of miliary, lymphatic, peritoneal, and pulmonary TB. Most of the TB cases occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. In these global clinical trials, cases of serious opportunistic infections have been reported at an overall rate of 0.08 per 100 patient-years. Some cases of serious opportunistic infections and TB have been fatal [see <ref type="bibr">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</ref>].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Autoantibodies</head><p>In the rheumatoid arthritis controlled trials, 12% of patients treated with HUMIRA and 7% of placebo-treated patients that had negative baseline ANA titers developed positive titers at week 24. Two patients out of 3046 treated with HUMIRA developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The patients improved following discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms. The impact of long-term treatment with HUMIRA on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Liver Enzyme Elevations</head><p>There have been reports of severe hepatic reactions including acute liver failure in patients receiving TNFblockers. In controlled Phase 3 trials of HUMIRA (40 mg SC every other week) in patients with RA, PsA, and AS with control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 3.5% of HUMIRA-treated patients and 1.5% of control-treated patients. Since many of these patients in these trials were also taking medications that cause liver enzyme elevations (e.g., NSAIDS, MTX), the relationship between HUMIRA and the liver enzyme elevations is not clear. In controlled Phase 3 trials of HUMIRA (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg, or 80 mg and 40 mg on Days 1 and 15, respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in patients with CD with control period duration ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of HUMIRA-treated patients and 0.9% of control-treated patients. In controlled Phase 3 trials of HUMIRA (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg on Days 1 and 15 respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in patients with UC with control period duration ranging from 1 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations ≥3 x ULN occurred in 1.5% of HUMIRA-treated patients and 1.0% of control-treated patients. In controlled Phase 3 trials of HUMIRA (initial dose of 80 mg then 40 mg every other week) in patients with Ps with control period duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of HUMIRA-treated patients and 1.8% of control-treated patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunogenicity</head><p>Patients in Studies RA-I, RA-II, and RA-III were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to adalimumab during the 6-to 12-month period. Approximately 5% (58 of 1062) of adult RA patients receiving HUMIRA developed low-titer antibodies to adalimumab at least once during treatment, which were neutralizing in vitro.</p><p>Patients treated with concomitant methotrexate (MTX) had a lower rate of antibody development than patients on HUMIRA monotherapy (1% versus 12%). No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse reactions was observed. With monotherapy, patients receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In patients receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive patients than among antibody-negative patients. The long-term immunogenicity of HUMIRA is unknown.</p><p>In patients with JIA, adalimumab antibodies were identified in 16% of HUMIRA-treated patients. In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence was 6% compared to 26% with HUMIRA monotherapy.</p><p>In patients with AS, the rate of development of antibodies to adalimumab in HUMIRA-treated patients was comparable to patients with RA.</p><p>In patients with PsA, the rate of antibody development in patients receiving HUMIRA monotherapy was comparable to patients with RA; however, in patients receiving concomitant MTX the rate was 7% compared to 1% in RA.</p><p>In patients with CD, the rate of antibody development was 3%.</p><p>In patients with moderately to severely active UC, the rate of antibody development in patients receiving HUMIRA was 5%. However, due to the limitation of the assay conditions, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab levels were &lt; 2 ug/ml. Among the patients whose serum adalimumab levels were &lt; 2 ug/ml (approximately 25% of total patients studied), the immunogenicity rate was 20.7%.</p><p>In patients with Ps, the rate of antibody development with HUMIRA monotherapy was 8%. However, due to the limitation of the assay conditions, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab levels were &lt; 2 ug/ml. Among the patients whose serum adalimumab levels were &lt; 2 ug/ml (approximately 40% of total patients studied), the immunogenicity rate was 20.7%. In Ps patients who were on HUMIRA monotherapy and subsequently withdrawn from the treatment, the rate of antibodies to adalimumab after retreatment was similar to the rate observed prior to withdrawal.</p><p>The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to adalimumab in an ELISA assay, and are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. The observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay is highly dependent on several factors including assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to adalimumab with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11">DESCRIPTION</head><p>HUMIRA (adalimumab) is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for human tumor necrosis factor (TNF). HUMIRA was created using phage display technology resulting in an antibody with human derived heavy and light chain variable regions and human IgG1:k constant regions. Adalimumab is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell expression system and is purified by a process that includes specific viral inactivation and removal steps. It consists of 1330 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 148 kilodaltons.</p><p>HUMIRA is supplied as a sterile, preservative-free solution of adalimumab for subcutaneous administration. The drug product is supplied as either a single-use, prefilled pen (HUMIRA Pen) or as a single-use, 1 mL prefilled glass syringe. Enclosed within the pen is a single-use, 1 mL prefilled glass syringe. The solution of HUMIRA is clear and colorless, with a pH of about 5.2.</p><p>Each prefilled syringe delivers 0.8 mL <ref type="formula">(40 mg</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12.1">Mechanism of Action</head><p>Adalimumab binds specifically to TNF-alpha and blocks its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab also lyses surface TNF expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complement. Adalimumab does not bind or inactivate lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Elevated levels of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of patients with RA, JIA, PsA, and AS and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased levels of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In Ps, treatment with HUMIRA may reduce the epidermal thickness and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism(s) by which HUMIRA exerts its clinical effects is unknown.</p><p>Adalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC 50 of 1-2 X 10 -10 M).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12.2">Pharmacodynamics</head><p>After treatment with HUMIRA, a decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-reactive protein <ref type="bibr">[CRP]</ref> and erythrocyte sedimentation rate <ref type="bibr">[ESR]</ref>) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was observed compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Serum levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodeling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after HUMIRA administration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12.3">Pharmacokinetics</head><p>The maximum serum concentration (C max ) and the time to reach the maximum concentration (T max ) were 4.7 ± 1.6 µg/mL and 131 ± 56 hours respectively, following a single 40 mg subcutaneous administration of HUMIRA to healthy adult subjects. The average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was 64%. The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab were linear over the dose range of 0.5 to 10.0 mg/kg following a single intravenous dose.</p><p>The single dose pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in RA patients were determined in several studies with intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg. The distribution volume (V ss ) ranged from 4.7 to 6.0 L. The systemic clearance of adalimumab is approximately 12 mL/hr. The mean terminal half-life was approximately 2 weeks, ranging from 10 to 20 days across studies. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from five rheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31 to 96% of those in serum.</p><p>In RA patients receiving 40 mg HUMIRA every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations of approximately 5 µg/mL and 8 to 9 µg/mL, were observed without and with methotrexate (MTX), respectively. MTX reduced adalimumab apparent clearance after single and multiple dosing by 29% and 44% respectively, in patients with RA. Mean serum adalimumab trough levels at steady state increased approximately proportionally with dose following 20, 40, and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous dosing. In long-term studies with dosing more than two years, there was no evidence of changes in clearance over time.</p><p>Adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were slightly higher in psoriatic arthritis patients treated with 40 mg HUMIRA every other week (6 to 10 µg/mL and 8.5 to 12 µg/mL, without and with MTX, respectively) compared to the concentrations in RA patients treated with the same dose.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in patients with AS were similar to those in patients with RA.</p><p>In patients with CD, the loading dose of 160 mg HUMIRA on Week 0 followed by 80 mg HUMIRA on Week 2 achieves mean serum adalimumab trough levels of approximately 12 µg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4. Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 µg/mL were observed at Week 24 and Week 56 in CD patients after receiving a maintenance dose of 40 mg HUMIRA every other week.</p><p>In patients with UC, the loading dose of 160 mg HUMIRA on Week 0 followed by 80 mg HUMIRA on Week 2 achieves mean serum adalimumab trough levels of approximately 12 µg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4. Mean steady-state trough level of approximately 8 µg/mL was observed at Week 52 in UC patients after receiving a dose of 40 mg HUMIRA every other week, and approximately 15 µg/mL at Week 52 in UC patients who increased to a dose of 40 mg HUMIRA every week.</p><p>In patients with Ps, the mean steady-state trough concentration was approximately 5 to 6 µg/mL during HUMIRA 40 mg every other week monotherapy treatment.</p><p>Population pharmacokinetic analyses in patients with RA revealed that there was a trend toward higher apparent clearance of adalimumab in the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies, and lower clearance with increasing age in patients aged 40 to &gt;75 years.</p><p>Minor increases in apparent clearance were also predicted in RA patients receiving doses lower than the recommended dose and in RA patients with high rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations. These increases are not likely to be clinically important.</p><p>No gender-related pharmacokinetic differences were observed after correction for a patient's body weight. Healthy volunteers and patients with rheumatoid arthritis displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics.</p><p>No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.</p><p>In subjects with JIA (4 to 17 years of age), the mean steady-state trough serum adalimumab concentrations for subjects weighing &lt;30 kg receiving 20 mg HUMIRA subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with concomitant methotrexate were 6.8 µg/mL and 10.9 µg/mL, respectively. The mean steady-state trough serum adalimumab concentrations for subjects weighing ≥30 kg receiving 40 mg HUMIRA subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with concomitant methotrexate were 6.6 µg/mL and 8.1 µg/mL, respectively.</p></div>

Patients had at least 6 swollen and 9 tender joints. HUMIRA was administered subcutaneously in combination with methotrexate (MTX) (12.5 to 25 mg, Studies RA-I, RA-III and RA-V) or as monotherapy (Studies RA-II and RA-V) or with other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Study RA-IV).</p><p>Study RA-I evaluated 271 patients who had failed therapy with at least one but no more than four DMARDs and had inadequate response to MTX. Doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg of HUMIRA or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks.</p><p>Study RA-II evaluated 544 patients who had failed therapy with at least one DMARD. Doses of placebo, 20 or 40 mg of HUMIRA were given as monotherapy every other week or weekly for 26 weeks.</p><p>Study RA-III evaluated 619 patients who had an inadequate response to MTX. Patients received placebo, 40 mg of HUMIRA every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks, or 20 mg of HUMIRA weekly for up to 52 weeks. Study RA-III had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of inhibition of disease progression (as detected by X-ray results). Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of HUMIRA was administered every other week for up to 5 years.</p><p>Study RA-IV assessed safety in 636 patients who were either DMARD-naive or were permitted to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days. Patients were randomized to 40 mg of HUMIRA or placebo every other week for 24 weeks.</p><p>Study RA-V evaluated 799 patients with moderately to severely active RA of less than 3 years duration who were ≥18 years old and MTX naïve. Patients were randomized to receive either MTX (optimized to 20 mg/week by week 8), HUMIRA 40 mg every other week or HUMIRA/MTX combination therapy for 104 weeks. Patients were evaluated for signs and symptoms, and for radiographic progression of joint damage. The median disease duration among patients enrolled in the study was 5 months. The median MTX dose achieved was 20 mg.</p></div>

The results of Study RA-I were similar to Study RA-III; patients receiving HUMIRA 40 mg every other week in Study RA-I also achieved ACR 20, 50 and 70 response rates of 65%, 52% and 24%, respectively, compared to placebo responses of 13%, 7% and 3% respectively, at 6 months (p&lt;0.01).</p><p>The results of the components of the ACR response criteria for Studies RA-II and RA-III are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref>. ACR response rates and improvement in all components of ACR response were maintained to week 104. Over the 2 years in Study RA-III, 20% of HUMIRA patients receiving 40 mg every other week (EOW) achieved a major clinical response, defined as maintenance of an ACR 70 response over a 6-month period. ACR responses were maintained in similar proportions of patients for up to 5 years with continuous HUMIRA treatment in the open-label portion of Study RA-III. The time course of ACR 20 response for Study RA-III is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>In Study RA-III, 85% of patients with ACR 20 responses at week 24 maintained the response at 52 weeks.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Study RA-III ACR 20 Responses over 52 Weeks</head><p>In Study RA-IV, 53% of patients treated with HUMIRA 40 mg every other week plus standard of care had an ACR 20 response at week 24 compared to 35% on placebo plus standard of care (p&lt;0.001). No unique adverse reactions related to the combination of HUMIRA (adalimumab) and other DMARDs were observed.</p><p>In Study RA-V with MTX naïve patients with recent onset RA, the combination treatment with HUMIRA plus MTX led to greater percentages of patients achieving ACR responses than either MTX monotherapy or HUMIRA monotherapy at Week 52 and responses were sustained at Week 104 (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 4</ref>). In Study RA-III, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score, at month 12 compared to baseline. At baseline, the median TSS was approximately 55 in the placebo and 40 mg every other week groups. The results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref>. HUMIRA/MTX treated patients demonstrated less radiographic progression than patients receiving MTX alone at 52 weeks. In the open-label extension of Study RA-III, 77% of the original patients treated with any dose of HUMIRA were evaluated radiographically at 2 years. Patients maintained inhibition of structural damage, as measured by the TSS. Fifty-four percent had no progression of structural damage as defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less. Fifty-five percent (55%) of patients originally treated with 40 mg HUMIRA every other week have been evaluated radiographically at 5 years. Patients had continued inhibition of structural damage with 50% showing no progression of structural damage defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less.</p><p>In Study RA-V, structural joint damage was assessed as in Study RA-III. Greater inhibition of radiographic progression, as assessed by changes in TSS, erosion score and JSN was observed in the HUMIRA/MTX combination group as compared to either the MTX or HUMIRA monotherapy group at Week 52 as well as at Week 104 (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 6</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Physical Function Response</head><p>In studies RA-I through IV, HUMIRA showed significantly greater improvement than placebo in the disability index of Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ-DI) from baseline to the end of study, and significantly greater improvement than placebo in the health-outcomes as assessed by The Short Form Health Survey (SF 36). Improvement was seen in both the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS).</p><p>In Study RA-III, the mean (95% CI) improvement in HAQ-DI from baseline at week 52 was 0.60 (0.55, 0.65) for the HUMIRA patients and 0.25 (0.17, 0.33) for placebo/MTX (p&lt;0.001) patients. Sixty-three percent of HUMIRA-treated patients achieved a 0.5 or greater improvement in HAQ-DI at week 52 in the double-blind portion of the study. Eighty-two percent of these patients maintained that improvement through week 104 and a similar proportion of patients maintained this response through week 260 (5 years) of open-label treatment. Mean improvement in the SF-36 was maintained through the end of measurement at week 156 (3 years).</p><p>In Study RA-V, the HAQ-DI and the physical component of the SF-36 showed greater improvement (p&lt;0.001) for the HUMIRA/MTX combination therapy group versus either the MTX monotherapy or the HUMIRA monotherapy group at Week 52, which was maintained through Week 104.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14.2">Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis</head><p>The safety and efficacy of HUMIRA were assessed in a multicenter, randomized, withdrawal, double-blind, parallel-group study in 171 children (4 to 17 years of age) with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). In the study, the patients were stratified into two groups: MTX-treated or non-MTX-treated. All subjects had to show signs of active moderate or severe disease despite previous treatment with NSAIDs, analgesics, corticosteroids, or DMARDS. Subjects who received prior treatment with any biologic DMARDS were excluded from the study.</p><p>The study included four phases: an open-label lead in phase (OL-LI; 16 weeks), a double-blind randomized withdrawal phase (DB; 32 weeks), an open-label extension phase <ref type="bibr">up to 136 weeks)</ref>, and an openlabel fixed dose phase (OLE-FD; 16 weeks). In the first three phases of the study, HUMIRA was administered based on body surface area at a dose of 24 mg/m 2 up to a maximum total body dose of 40 mg subcutaneously (SC) every other week. In the OLE-FD phase, the patients were treated with 20 mg of HUMIRA SC every other week if their weight was less than 30 kg and with 40 mg of HUMIRA SC every other week if their weight was 30 kg or greater. Patients remained on stable doses of NSAIDs and or prednisone (≤0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/day maximum).</p><p>Patients demonstrating a Pediatric ACR 30 response at the end of OL-LI phase were randomized into the double blind (DB) phase of the study and received either HUMIRA or placebo every other week for 32 weeks or until disease flare. Disease flare was defined as a worsening of ≥30% from baseline in ≥3 of 6 Pediatric ACR core criteria, ≥2 active joints, and improvement of &gt;30% in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria. After 32 weeks or at the time of disease flare during the DB phase, patients were treated in the open-label extension phase based on the BSA regimen (OLE-BSA), before converting to a fixed dose regimen based on body weight (OLE-FD phase).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Response</head><p>At the end of the 16-week OL-LI phase, 94% of the patients in the MTX stratum and 74% of the patients in the non-MTX stratum were Pediatric ACR 30 responders. In the DB phase significantly fewer patients who received HUMIRA experienced disease flare compared to placebo, both without MTX (43% vs. 71%) and with MTX (37% vs. 65%). More patients treated with HUMIRA continued to show pediatric ACR 30/50/70 responses at Week 48 compared to patients treated with placebo.

Upon completion of both studies, 383 patients enrolled in an open-label extension study, in which 40 mg HUMIRA was administered every other week.</p><p>Study PsA-I enrolled 313 adult patients with moderately to severely active PsA (&gt;3 swollen and &gt;3 tender joints) who had an inadequate response to NSAID therapy in one of the following forms: (1) distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement (N=23); (2) polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid nodules and presence of plaque psoriasis) (N=210); (3) arthritis mutilans (N=1); (4) asymmetric PsA (N=77); or (5) ASlike (N=2). Patients on MTX therapy (158 of 313 patients) at enrollment (stable dose of ≤30 mg/week for &gt;1 month) could continue MTX at the same dose. Doses of HUMIRA 40 mg or placebo every other week were administered during the 24-week double-blind period of the study.</p><p>Compared to placebo, treatment with HUMIRA resulted in improvements in the measures of disease activity (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Tables 7 and 8</ref>). Among patients with PsA who received HUMIRA, the clinical responses were apparent in some patients at the time of the first visit (two weeks) and were maintained up to 88 weeks in the ongoing open-label study. Similar responses were seen in patients with each of the subtypes of psoriatic arthritis, although few patients were enrolled with the arthritis mutilans and ankylosing spondylitis-like subtypes. Responses were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX therapy at baseline.</p><p>Patients with psoriatic involvement of at least three percent body surface area (BSA) were evaluated for Psoriatic Area and Severity Index (PASI) responses. At 24 weeks, the proportions of patients achieving a 75% or 90% improvement in the PASI were 59% and 42% respectively, in the HUMIRA group (N=69), compared to 1% and 0% respectively, in the placebo group (N=69) (p&lt;0.001).

Patients received placebo, or an initial dose of 80 mg HUMIRA at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1 for 16 weeks. Across all treatment groups the mean baseline PASI score was 21 and the baseline PGA score ranged from "moderate" (41%) to "severe" (51%) to "very severe" (8%).</p><p>Studies Ps-I and II evaluated the proportion of patients who achieved "clear" or "minimal" disease on the 6 point PGA scale and the proportion of patients who achieved a reduction in PASI score of at least 75% (PASI 75) from baseline at Week 16 (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 14</ref> and 15).</p><p>Additionally, Study Ps-I evaluated the proportion of subjects who maintained a PGA of "clear" or "minimal" disease or a PASI 75 response after Week 33 and on or before Week 52. 578 (71%) 26 (7%) * Clear = no plaque elevation, no scale, plus or minus hyperpigmentation or diffuse pink or red coloration Minimal = possible but difficult to ascertain whether there is slight elevation of plaque above normal skin, plus or minus surface dryness with some white coloration, plus or minus up to red coloration HUMIRA 40 mg every other week Placebo N = 99 N = 48 PGA: Clear or minimal* 70 (71%) 5 (10%) PASI 75 77 (78%) 9 (19%) * Clear = no plaque elevation, no scale, plus or minus hyperpigmentation or diffuse pink or red coloration Minimal = possible but difficult to ascertain whether there is slight elevation of plaque above normal skin, plus or minus surface dryness with some white coloration, plus or minus up to red coloration Additionally, in Study Ps-I, subjects on HUMIRA who maintained a PASI 75 were re-randomized to HUMIRA (N = 250) or placebo (N = 240) at Week 33. After 52 weeks of treatment with HUMIRA, more patients on HUMIRA maintained efficacy when compared to subjects who were re-randomized to placebo based on maintenance of PGA of "clear" or "minimal" disease (68% vs. 28%) or a PASI 75 (79% vs. 43%).</p><p>A total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an open-label extension study. Median time to relapse (decline to PGA "moderate" or worse) was approximately 5 months. During the withdrawal period, no subject experienced transformation to either pustular or erythrodermic psoriasis. A total of 178 subjects who relapsed re-initiated treatment with 80 mg of HUMIRA, then 40 mg eow beginning at week 1. At week 16, 69% (123/178) of subjects had a response of PGA "clear" or "minimal".</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>This resubmission, received March 30, 2012, is a complete response to the CR letter, and represents the second review cycle for this sBLA. The Sponsor proposes to market adalimumab (Humira) for the following indication in adults:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1)</head><p>reducing signs and symptoms, and inducing and maintaining induction of clinical remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy HUMIRA® (adalimumab) is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for human tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Adalimumab was approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis on December 31, 2002 and was subsequently approved for treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease (CD), and plaque psoriasis. In this supplemental Biological License Application (sBLA), the Sponsor pursues the approval of adalimumab with labeling revision for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Adalimumab binds specifically to TNF-alpha and blocks its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab also lyses surface TNF expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complement. Adalimumab does not bind or inactivate lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses of ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel disease.</p><p>The Applicant presents data from three phase 3 studies were included in this submission: M06-826 (the pivotal induction study), M06-827 (the pivotal maintenance study), and M10-223 (long-term single-arm, open-label trial that enrolled 498 patients). The endpoints for the two submitted pivotal trials are summarized below. In both studies, clinical remission was defined as a total Mayo score of ≤2 with no individual subscore &gt;1.</p><p>Study M06-826 has an 8-or 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled period which is followed by open-label treatment through Week 52. The objective was to evaluated adalimumab for the effectiveness of induction treatment. The study enrolled 576 subjects. The primary endpoint was clinical remission per Mayo score which is defined as total Mayo score ≤ 2 and no individual subscore &gt; 1. (Mayo Score is a composite sore of UC disease activity ranging from 0 to 12 based on the sum of 4 sub scores. The higher the score is, the more severe the disease is. The four sub-scores include endoscopy, stool frequency, rectal bleeding and physician's global assessment.) Week 8 remission rate was 9.2% in the placebo arm and 18.5% in the adalimumab 160/80/40 arm (P=0.031). The adalimumab low dose arm (80/40/40) had a 10.0% clinical remission rate at week 8 which was not significantly different from placebo (P=0.833).</p><p>Study M06-827 is a 52-week randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study that evaluated adalimumab for the effectiveness of induction and maintenance treatment. The study enrolled 518 subjects. The ranked co-primary efficacy endpoints were the proportion of subjects who achieved remission at Week 8 and the proportion of subjects who achieved remission at Week 52. Week 8 remission rate was achieved by 9.3% of subjects in the placebo arm and 16.5% of subjects in the adalimumab 160/80/40 arm (P=0.019).</p><p>Week 52 remission was achieved in 8.5% of subjects in the placebo arm and 17.3% of subjects in the adalimumab 160/80/40 arm (P=0.004).</p><p>Study M10-223 evaluated the long-term maintenance of response, safety and tolerability of repeated administration of adalimumab in subjects with UC who participated in and successfully completed Study M06-826 or Study M06-827.</p><p>The concerns with this application initially involved the marginal efficacy noted in Study M06-826 and 827. Although the clinical remission rate at Week 8 in the adalimumab 160/80/40 treatment group for Study M06-826 was statistically higher than that in the placebo group (18.5% vs. 9.2%, p=0.031), these results are sensitive to alternative analyses, and the conclusions are not considered robust from a statistical perspective. For example, adjusting the primary analysis for the significantly different baseline Mayo scores, the treatment differences were not significant (p=0.085). Moreover, the significance of the analysis results is sensitive to the use of exact testing methods as well as the classification status based on a single subject. This issue was intimately related to the clinical meaningfulness of the data. I was concerned that the clinical development program lacks adequate justification of the balance of risk and benefit of adalimumab treatment for the induction and maintenance of clinical remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Given the known serious risks associated with the use of Humira, the data presented in the current Application do not adequately demonstrate that Humira has clinically meaningful efficacy. Further, the results of the submitted studies show that the benefit of Humira for reducing signs and symptoms and inducing and maintaining induction of clinical remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy does not outweigh the risks. Given the small treatment effect and E-R analysis results suggest that higher dose may achieve greater treatment effect [for induction], the sponsor should explore higher doses for inducing remission in a clinical trial that define an appropriately labeled dose related to clinical efficacy of Humira. Without an appropriately defined dose, the benefit-risk assessment for Humira may not be favorable, a conclusion that is supported by the fragility of the data. This conclusion is demonstrated through sensitivity analyses revealing that Study M06-826 could be a "negative" study, if a change in the responder status of 1 subjects in the adalimumab 160/80/40 group from responder to non-responder, or in the responder status of just 1 placebo subject from non-responder to responder. This impacts the interpretation of the benefit risk assessment relative to the differences in improvement in clinical remission rates reported (treatment difference in clinical remission at Week 8 of 9.3% and 7.2% in Studies 826 and 827, respectively and treatment difference in sustained clinical remission at Weeks 8 and 52 of 4.4% in Study 827), in light of the known risks of Humira (such as malignancies, serious infections, serious allergic reactions, hepatitis B virus reactivation, new onset or exacerbation of demyelinating disease, new or worsening heart failure, and lupus-like syndrome).</p><p>Remicade is currently approved for the same indications as those proposed for Humira and the two drug products have very similar safety profiles. While there are limitations associated with the use of cross study comparisons, the data from the Remicade approval studies and NNT analyses suggest that Remicade is more efficacious than Humira for the proposed UC indications.</p><p>In summary the data in the original application did not establish that adalimumab is effective and safe for the treatment of patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. I have concluded that there was not sufficient evidence of clinical benefit, which coupled with some concerns of safety, makes it impossible for me to justify the marketing of this product without additional key information. The decision to provide a complete response was supplemented by convening an advisory committee in August 2012 to address a path forward.</p><p>Subsequent to the execution of a Gastroenterology Drug Advisory Committee held on August 28, 2012 to discuss this application, the nearly unanimous recommendation by the experts was approval of this application. Discussion of the clinical meaningfulness of the data as compared to statistical significance of the primary endpoint analysis was featured topics during the GIDAC. The majority of Committee members believed that the observed treatment differences, small in magnitude but statistically significant, do represent a clinically meaningful benefit to the population of UC patients, primarily because of the continuing need for treatment alternatives. The majority further believed that the demonstrated benefit is sufficient to outweigh the risks and that the benefit-risk decision can be made by individual patients with their providers.</p><p>Given the adequacy of clinical trials to sufficiently demonstrate efficacy and the Committee's recommendations that these results are meaningful and outweigh the product's risks, I have agreed with the team recommendation of approval of Humira for this indication. In fact the Team Leader Dr. Welch of Statistics has stated: "The sponsor's complete response satisfactorily addressed the statistical issues in the CR letter. Although much of the resubmission was based on exploratory analyses, the results should be considered supportive. From a statistical perspective, both studies 826 and 827 met their primary objective to show induction of clinical remission at week 8. However, replication of effect was only seen in patients who did not have prior UC therapy. Study 827 demonstrated a treatment effect for induction at 52 weeks and a small effect for induction at both 8 and 52 weeks. The study was not designed to support maintenance of remission, since subjects were not re-randomized at week 8; however, the given results would seem to support a "sustained remission" claim under the condition that completers were in remission during the time-course of study, and that patients who terminated early were not in remission at time of withdrawal.</p><p>In light of the secondary reviews, however, we recommend that the product be indicated for "inducing and sustaining remission", which is more specific than "achieving" remission but does not include the more stringent efficacy claim of "maintenance of remission". Given our uncertainty about the long-term benefit of Humira to sustain remission, we recommend the drug be continued beyond 8 weeks only in patients who have achieved remission within that time. Further, we recommend that the product be indicated only for TNFα-antagonist naïve patients, because the evidence failed to demonstrate benefit in patients with prior exposure to these products.</p><p>In addition, there will be a number of postmarket commitments (PMCs) from the Sponsor as more fully detailed in this review consistent with the GIDAC recommendations described below. These include studies related to exploring risk of HSCTL, long-term safety of serious infections and malignancies and long-term effectiveness in a comparative registry, evaluating low adalimumab exposures benefit from dose escalation without increasing risk of serious adverse events, conducting an assessment of anti-adalimumab antibody response to Humira, with a validated assay capable of sensitively detecting anti-adalimumab antibodies, conducting a trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of induction regimens at doses higher than 160/80 mg and evaluating the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. The specific indication approved will be modified from the Applicant's initial proposal and specifically state: Inducing and sustaining clinical remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids, azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP). The effectiveness of HUMIRA has not been established in patients who have lost response to or were intolerant to TNF blockers</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background</head><p>The reader is referred to Dr. Peterson's Clinical Review for further discussion of the regulatory history concerning Humira. Briefly, HUMIRA® (adalimumab) is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for human tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Adalimumab was approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis on December 31, 2002 and was subsequently approved for treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease (CD), and plaque psoriasis. In this supplemental Biological License Application (sBLA), the applicant pursues the approval of adalimumab with labeling revision for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">CMC</head><p>The reader is referred to the CMC Review by Jun Park. The CMC Reviewer noted that the Clinical Pharmacology Reviewer raised a concern about the sensitivity of both AAA assays to product interference (i.e., neither the original nor the new AAA assay is able to appropriately measure AAA because of product interference) (see Section 5.1 of this CDTL Review). The CMC Reviewer concluded that an assay with improved drug tolerance should be developed.</p><p>The following deficiency is included in the CRL:</p><p>"The immunogenicity assay was not adequate. Develop, qualify and implement an improved validated anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) assay with reduced sensitivity to product interference. Provide a detailed description of the methodology and plans for validation of the assays that will be used for the detection of AAA. The qualification results should include data demonstrating that the assay is specific, sensitive and reproducible, and should include information on the sensitivity of the assay to drug interference. The validated assay should be capable of sensitively detecting AAA responses in the presence of adalimumab levels that are expected to be present at the time of patient sampling. Until assays have been developed and validated, patients samples collected from clinical studies should be banked under appropriate storage conditions." There were no new CMC data in the resubmission, and no additional review of CMC data was performed in the current review cycle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Nonclinical Pharmacology/Toxicology</head><p>No new review issues are identified and no nonclinical issues were raised.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Clinical Pharmacology/Biopharmaceutics</head><p>I share my agreement regarding concerns of Dr. Zhou's initial review that there are significant concerns regarding the lack of complete understanding of the exposure response relationship of adalimumab in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderately active to severe ulcerative colitis. The exposure-response analysis conducted based on data from Study M06-827 suggested a higher induction dose might achieve a greater treatment effect for the induction of clinical remission at Week 8. The Clinical Pharmacology Reviewer stated that this conclusion is mainly based on two observations as summarized by Dr. Rajpal: 1) There was an increased remission rate with increased exposures that did not plateau at higher exposures. A statistically-significant (p=0.0002) relationship was established between adalimumab Week 8 trough concentration and clinical remission at Week 8 using logistic regression. The figure below demonstrates the exposure-response relationship for clinical remission at Week 8 suggesting that higher exposures may be associated with a higher clinical remission rate. Thus, this finding suggests that a higher dose may produce additional benefit for inducing clinical remission. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine if the relationship between Week 8 adalimumab trough concentration and Week 8 clinical remission was confounded by baseline Mayo score and prior anti-TNF exposure. When adjusting for baseline Mayo score and prior exposure to anti-TNF therapy, the week 8 adalimumab trough concentration was still significant (p=0.0003). As a follow up concern, patients with lower exposures in the induction phase were unable to maintain response and switched to open-label treatment earlier than patients with higher exposures. The figure below demonstrates that subjects who had lower Week 8 adalimumab trough concentrations lost response earlier than the subjects with higher Week 8 concentrations. This provides additional evidence that exposures achieved by the 160/80/40 induction dose may not be sufficient to maintain response. Proportional hazards analysis showed that Week 8 concentrations are significantly associated with time to inadequate response after correcting for previous exposure to anti-TNF therapy at baseline and baseline Mayo score. Maintenance Phase:</p><p>The Clinical Pharmacology Reviewer concluded that a robust exposure-response relationship for the maintenance phase could not be established due to significant drop out and missing PK data. Although the model relating steady state adalimumab trough concentrations to Week 52 remission demonstrates a weak trend in exposure-response (p=0.01, see figure below), suggesting a higher dose may provide additional benefit, the analysis is based on only 78 patients (31% of the total treatment population) who remained in the double-blind phase throughout the trial and had PK data. Other limitations noted by the Clinical Pharmacology Reviewer included the following: (a) The analysis dataset included non-remitters at Week 8. (b) Only a marginally significant (p=0.04) exposure-response relationship was observed using a logistic regression analysis that adjusted for baseline Mayo score and prior anti-TNF use. (c) The data used in this analysis may not be representative of the actual treatment population since the clinical remission rate is 33% (43/132) for patients who remained in the double-blind treatment phase compared to 50% (39/78) for subjects who remained in double blind phase and had PK data. In addition there is lack of understanding the impact of Immunogenicity on Adalimumab Pharmacokinetics. No conclusions can be made regarding the impact of immunogenicity on pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and safety because only very small number of subjects had confirmed antibody status. The assessment of immunogenicity incidence was not adequate in the current submission. The majority of subjects (74.4%, 268/360) had no immunogenicity assessment due to high drug concentration (≥2 mcg/mL) and they could not be ruled as negative. Among the subjects with immunogenicity assessed, anti-adalimumab antibodies (AAA) were observed in 20.7% (19/92) of patients. Dr. Zhou states: "Our exposure-response analysis indicates that the dosing has not been fully explored. Without a better defined dosing paradigm the clinical efficacy of Humira in this population can not be considered adequately defined. No conclusions can be made regarding the impact of immunogenicity on pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and safety because majority of the subjects in the phase 3 studies were not tested for anti-adalimumab antibodies due to drug interference. In order to obtain an adequate adalimumab immunogenicity profile, we recommend that the Sponsor <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> develop an assay with improved drug tolerance to allow detecting anti-adalimumab antibodies in the presence of adalimumab drug concentration in the study samples collected from patients during treatment, and/or 2) collect post-dose samples at time points where the adalimumab drug concentrations are not expected to interfere with the immunogenicity assay (i.e., adalimumab concentration ≤ 2 μg/mL)." From a Clinical Pharmacology perspective, the combination of a lack of adequate dose-response combined with a lack of adequate immunogenicity information will limit our ability to write adequate labeling concerning the use of this product.</p><p>Based on the feedback of the GIDAC concerning these issues, there was no change in the perspectives of the Clinical Pharmacology reviewers. The confidence in the dataset suggesting that the exposure-response analysis suggested that a higher induction dose would lead to a higher treatment effect in induction of clinical remission, the Clinical Pharmacology Reviewers recommended studies to study a higher induction dose. Communication of the PMCs will be discussed below in the approval letter and more fully detailed in section 13 of this review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Clinical Microbiology</head><p>Clinical Microbiology considerations do not apply to this application because Humira is not an antimicrobial agent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Clinical/Statistical-Efficacy</head><p>In the original cycle of this application, the reader is referred to Dr. Rajpal's CDTL memorandum for further review and complete information of historical efficacy and safety data related to clinical trial and exposure data related to adalimumab. Dr. Rajpal recommends a Complete Response to this application for the reasons stating: "Your submission does not provide substantial evidence to establish the efficacy of Humira for reducing signs and symptoms, and inducing and maintaining induction of clinical remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. To address this deficiency, we recommend that you provide additional evidence of efficacy from either: (a) comprehensive re-analyses of outcome data from the clinical trials you have already conducted with Humira; or (b) additional adequate and wellcontrolled trial(s)." It is my decision that the Agency plans to discuss the efficacy data presented in this application at a future meeting of the Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee I do not agree that conduct of comprehensive re-analyses of outcome data would adequately address the deficiency. Given the known serious risks associated with the use of Humira, the data presented in the current application do not adequately demonstrate that Humira has clinically meaningful efficacy. Although the clinical remission rate at Week 8 in the adalimumab 160/80/40 treatment group for Study M06-826 was statistically higher than that in the placebo group (18.5% vs. 9.2%, p=0.031), these results are sensitive to alternative analyses, and the conclusions are not considered robust from a statistical perspective. For example, adjusting the primary analysis for the significantly different baseline Mayo scores, the treatment differences were not significant (p=0.085). Moreover the significance of the analysis results is sensitive to the use of exact testing methods as well as the classification status based on a single subject. This impacts the interpretation of the benefit risk assessment relative to the differences in improvement in clinical remission rates reported (treatment difference in clinical remission at Week 8 of 9.3% and 7.2% in Studies 826 and 827, respectively and treatment difference in sustained clinical remission at Weeks 8 and 52 of 4.4% in Study 827) and the known risks of Humira (such as malignancies, serious infections, serious allergic reactions, hepatitis B virus reactivation, new onset or exacerbation of demyelinating disease, new or worsening heart failure, and lupus-like syndrome).</p><p>The data in the original application did not allow the establishment of a favorable benefit risk assessment for adalimumab for the treatment of patients in reducing signs and symptoms and inducing and maintaining induction of clinical remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Remicade is currently approved for the same indications as those proposed for Humira and the two drug products have very similar safety profiles. Despite the contrast to already approved medications for the same indication, it is important to understand that there are limitations associated with the use of cross study comparisons. The data from the Remicade approval studies and NNT analyses suggest that Remicade is more efficacious than Humira for the proposed UC indication. The marginal differences in efficacy observed with adalimumab and the fragility of the data as determined by sensitivity analyses leads to conclude that this application should receive a Complete Response.</p><p>It is my conclusion to defer to the counsel of the 2012 Advisory Committee that discussed this application; we have made a revised Risk Benefit assessment approving adalimumab for the indication (see below). The Advisory Committee was asked to comment on the clinical significance of the marginal differences exhibited in efficacy differences between adalimumab and placebo and the corresponding determination of benefit and risk with this application.</p><p>In the Complete response submission by the Applicant, numerous exploratory analyses were conducted as outlined by Drs. Gottlieb and Fan in their reviews. Specifically these included primary and secondary analyses of Study 826 using the ITT-E population (i.e., all patients enrolled that received study drug or placebo); integrated primary and secondary analyses across Studies 826 and 827; additional exploratory analyses from Study 827 (e.g., clinical response based on partial Mayo score at Weeks 2, 4, and 8 and clinical response based on full Mayo score at Week 8); re-analysis of full and partial Mayo scores at Baseline and Week 52 using average of last 3 days (rather than standard "worst-ranked" methodology)-Study 827; all-cause and UC-related hospitalizations (pooled across Studies 826 and 827); and exploratory analyses of clinical remission and clinical response status at Week 52 in the subgroup of patients from Study 827 in clinical response at Week 8.</p><p>The following analyses were conducted by the sponsor in an attempt to combine safety and efficacy data and will be reviewed in section 7.</p><p>serious adverse event (SAE)-adjusted days in remission number of patients who discontinued due to adverse events (AEs) relative to number of patients in remission at Weeks 8 and 52 Net Efficacy Adjusted Risk (NEAR) analysis Number Needed to Harm (NNH) analyses</p><p>Initially my impression and that of the reviewers that the numerous post-hoc analyses are insufficient to support approval and statistical evaluation with p values pose no strong support for the approval decision. From the GIDAC, it was clear that the data were interpreted by the AC experts as contributing clinical meaningfulness to the submitted data. For example, the minutes captured the following assessments by the GI experts: Those voting "Yes" commented about unmet need, compliance &amp; convenience issues, which favored having adalimumab as a treatment option. The study did show statistical significance as compared to placebo, at week 8, albeit the differences being marginal. One member noted the long record of use of this drug and of the class of drugs. Several noted that currently given few treatment choices adalimumab would be another option, especially for difficult to treat patients. Committee members hence endorsed Humira voting that it resulted in clinically meaningful benefit. Even the marginal benefit was acceptable given the high disease burden with regards to its impact on quality of life." It should be stated though that the analyses offered by the Statistical review still were not completely satisfied with the conclusions of the GIDAC relative to the clinical meaningfulness of the dataset. As noted by Dr. Rajpal, "The statistical reviewer continues to be concerned about the high amount of missing data and commented that with approximately 70% missing data, the results for sustained clinical remission may not be reliable. This reviewer notes that this is not an approvability issue." The Statistical Team Leader also stated, "The sponsor's complete response satisfactorily addressed many of the statistical issues raised in the CR letter. Although much of the resubmission was based on exploratory analyses, the results should be considered supportive." From a statistical perspective, both studies 826 and 827 met their primary objective to show induction of clinical remission at week 8. However, replication of effect was only seen in patients who did not have prior UC therapy using TNF blockers. Study 827 demonstrated a treatment effect for induction at 52 weeks and a small effect for induction at both 8 and 52 weeks. The GIDAC supported the clinical meaningfulness but the population will be refined to reflect the strength of the data.</p><p>I will agree with the Clinical and Statistical recommendation for approval of Humira for the proposed indication with modifications above noted to the modified indication to stress the approvability of the data to support the use of Humira only in TNF blocker naïve treated patients.</p></div>

These known risks include malignancies, serious infections, serious allergic reactions, hepatitis B virus reactivation, new onset or exacerbation of demyelinating disease, new or worsening heart failure, and lupus-like syndrome.</p><p>The Clinical Reviewer concluded that there was no clear trend of higher incidence of AEs with increasing Humira dose seen in the UC studies.</p><p>The GIDAC concluded that there was not a significant safety issue with approval of Humira for this indication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Advisory Committee Meeting</head><p>An Advisory Committee meeting was convened August 28, 2012 to address the path forward for this application. In my initial opinion rendered supporting the Complete Response action, I concurred with Clinical and statistical reviewers that the clinical development program did not support the benefit outweighing the risk of adalimumab treatment for the induction and maintenance of clinical remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy, an advisory committee is necessary to identify future path. Given the small treatment effect and E-R analysis results suggest that higher dose may achieve greater treatment effect [for induction], the sponsor should explore higher doses for inducing remission in a clinical trial. Remicade is currently approved for the same indications as those proposed for Humira and the two drug products have very similar safety profiles. While there are limitations associated with the use of cross study comparisons, the data from the Remicade approval studies and NNT analyses suggest that Remicade is more efficacious than Humira for the proposed UC indications. Support for these initial review impressions is substantiated by the opinions of the GIDAC recommending that further dose exploration with higher doses be performed as a postmarketing requirement. Details of these postmarketing commitments are described below.</p><p>The data in the original BLA did not establish that adalimumab is effective and safe for the treatment of patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. I had concluded that there was not sufficient evidence of clinical benefit, which coupled with some concerns of safety, made it impossible for me to justify the marketing of this product without additional key information. Subsequent to the execution of a Gastroenterology Drug Advisory Committee held on August 28, 2012 to discuss this application, the nearly unanimous recommendation by the experts was approval of this application. Discussion of the clinical meaningfulness of the data as compared to statistical significance of the primary endpoint analysis was featured topics during the GIDAC. The majority of Committee members believed that the observed treatment differences, small in magnitude but statistically significant, do represent a clinically meaningful benefit to the population of UC patients, primarily because of the continuing need for treatment alternatives. The majority further believed that the demonstrated benefit is sufficient to outweigh the risks and that the benefitrisk decision can be made by individual patients with their providers.</p><p>Given the adequacy of clinical trials to sufficiently demonstrate efficacy and the Committee's recommendations that these results are meaningful and outweigh the product's risks, I have agreed with the team recommendation of approval of Humira for this indication. However, we recommend that the product be indicated for "inducing and sustaining remission", which is more specific than "achieving" remission but does not include the more stringent efficacy claim of "maintenance of remission". Given our uncertainty about the long-term benefit of Humira to sustain remission, we recommend the drug be continued beyond 8 weeks only in patients who have achieved remission within that time. Further, we recommend that the product be indicated only for TNFα-antagonist naïve patients, because the evidence failed to demonstrate benefit in patients with prior exposure to these products. As discussed below in Labeling Section 12, the notation of these specific limitations will be noted.</p><p>In addition, there will be postmarket commitments (PMCs) from the Sponsor more fully described in Section 13.2 Risk Benefit. The specific indication approved will be modified from the Applicant's initial proposal and specifically state: Inducing and sustaining clinical remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids, azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP). The effectiveness of HUMIRA has not been established in patients who have lost response to or were intolerant to TNF blockers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.">Pediatrics</head><p>The Pediatric clinical development program would need to validate appropriate endpoints for study in children with moderately to severe ulcerative colitis. The lack of complete understanding the identification of an effective dose of adalimumab in adults would preclude the adoption of extrapolation to children with moderately to severe UC as the basis for extrapolation is understanding the exposure response characteristics as discussed below. The role of pharmacokinetics in pediatric clinical trials is discussed in the FDA guidance Exposure-Response Relationships -Study Design, Data Analysis, and Regulatory Applications 1 . The Pediatric Study Decision tree from the FDA exposure relationship guidance depicts the role of PK and PD in the development of pediatric clinical trials (see below, excerpted from guidance).</p><p>From the recent Advisory committee of Remicade in ulcerative colitis (Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee (GIDAC) Hilton Washington DC/Silver Spring, Silver Spring, Maryland July 21, 2011 Summary Minutes), it is was deemed to be reasonable to extrapolate efficacy from adults with properly conducted clinical trials based on the assumption that the course of ulcerative colitis and its response to treatment in adult and pediatric patients are sufficiently similar to be able to extrapolate efficacy from adult to pediatric patients. The committee unanimously agreed that there was sufficient and well supported data to extrapolate from adult to pediatric patients for the induction of clinical remission.</p><p>In this situation it should be noted that Humira has orphan designation, PREA does not apply to the adult indication as the pediatric indication has orphan status (designation date of May 11, 2011) as noted by Dr. Rajpal in his review. It is not clear whether the Applicant is still pursuing a development plan for pediatric UC given the orphan designation status but a</p></div>

Long-term effectiveness should be assessed as a secondary goal. The proposed study should follow patients for a period of at least 10 years from time of enrollment in order to ascertain adverse events with longer latency periods such as malignancies. The primary analysis is to summarize safety data for patients on adalimumab and patients on nonbiologic immunomodulator therapy. The study should be adequately sized to sufficiently detect a doubling of the risk of lymphoma events in each treatment group. A secondary analysis is to summarize safety data for patients on adalimumab and patients on the combination of adalimumab and non-biologic immunomodulator therapy.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>This application was initially submitted as an efficacy supplement to the BLA (sBLA) for Humira (adalimumab) on January 25, 2011. A Complete Response (CR) Letter was sent by the Division on November 21, 2011. This resubmission, received March 30, 2012, is a complete response to the CR letter, and represents the second review cycle for this sBLA.</p><p>Proposed Indication: The proposed indications for ulcerative colitis (UC) in the initial submission and in the current resubmission are each shown below (emphasis added): Initial submission: "…for reducing signs and symptoms, and inducing and maintaining induction of clinical remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy." Current resubmission: "…for reducing signs and symptoms, and achieving clinical remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy."</p><p>Proposed Dose Regimen: The proposed dose regimen for the UC indication is 160 mg initially on Day 1 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg injections per day for two consecutive days), followed by 80 mg two weeks later (Day 15), followed in turn by a maintenance dose of 40 mg every other week beginning two weeks later (Day 29). It should be noted that this is the same dose regimen as that for the Crohn's disease indication.</p><p>Other Proposed Label Revisions: The Applicant also proposes additions to the Adverse Reactions, Clinical Pharmacology, and Clinical Studies sections.</p><p>Advisory Committee Meeting: The application was presented to the Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee during the current review cycle (August 28, 2012) to seek recommendations on dose selection, demonstration of clinically meaningful benefit, approvability, and need for additional pre-approval and/or post-approval studies. A large majority voted that the optimal dose has not been fully established; they explained that although the optimal dosing has not been fully explored, the dosing regimen studied demonstrated efficacy. A large majority voted that the observed treatment differences for clinical remission at Week 8, clinical remission at Week 52, and clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52 each represent a clinically meaningful benefit; in addition, a large majority voted that having clinical remission at Week 52 represents a clinically meaningful endpoint. A large majority voted that pre-approval studies were not necessary. Finally, a large majority voted in favor of approval. There was discussion about post-approval studies; recommendations included exploration of higher doses, evaluation of the relationship between trough concentrations and clinical remission rates, and development of an improved immunogenicity assay. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Humira (adalimumab)</head><p>Mechanism of Action: Adalimumab is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to TNFα and blocks its interaction with cell surface receptors, which in turn inhibits TNFα-induced pro-inflammatory effects.</p><p>Other Approved Indications: Humira was originally approved for rheumatoid arthritis in 2002. Since then, it has also been found to be effective in treating several other diseases, and it is currently also approved for juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, and plaque psoriasis. The safety and efficacy of Humira in pediatric patients for indications other than juvenile idiopathic arthritis have not been established.</p><p>Safety Information: Humira has no specific contraindications. The approved labeling has a boxed warning for serious infections and malignancies, which is part of TNFα-antagonist class labeling. The following serious adverse reactions are highlighted in the boxed warming for serious infections: tuberculosis, bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis), and infections due to other opportunistic pathogens. The following serious adverse reactions are highlighted in the boxed warming for malignancies: hepatosplenic Tcell lymphoma (HSTCL) and other lymphomas and malignancies. There are also warnings and precautions for hypersensitivity reactions, Hepatitis B virus reactivation, demyelinating disease, cytopenias, use with anakinra, heart failure, autoimmunity, use with live vaccines, and use with abatacept.</p><p>Dosing Recommendations (Other Approved Indications): The recommended dosing for each of the approved indications is summarized below: ▪ Rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis: 40 mg every other week. It should be noted that the labeling states that patients with rheumatoid arthritis who are not receiving concomitant methotrexate may benefit from increasing the dosing frequency to 40 mg every week. ▪ Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (patients 4 to 17 years of age): 20 mg every other week (for patients that weigh 15 to 30 kg), and 40 mg every week (for patients that weigh 30 kg or more). ▪ Plaque psoriasis: initial dose of 80 mg followed one week later by a dose of 40 mg every other week. ▪ Crohn's disease: same dose as that proposed for UC (i.e., 160 mg, followed two weeks later by a dose of 80 mg, in turn followed two weeks later by a dose of 40 mg every other week).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Ulcerative Colitis</head><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease of unknown etiology. Peak age of onset is in the early twenties, but age of onset can vary widely. UC is more common in whites vs. non-whites and in women vs. men. The disease is manifest as mucosal inflammation and mucosal ulceration that occurs in the colon in a continuous segment beginning with the rectum. Extent of involvement varies, but it can include the entire colon. Involved areas classically show inflammatory changes that are limited to the mucosa, and, depending on severity, there may be extensive, broad-based ulceration.</p><p>Clinically, UC presents as a chronic relapsing disease with variable-length bouts of bloody mucoid diarrhea and lower abdominal pain, but there may be long quiescent periods between attacks. There may also be systemic manifestations of the disease, with involvement of joints, eyes, skin, or the hepatobiliary system. Potential serious complications include severe bleeding, toxic megacolon, and perforation. There is a very significant risk of colon cancer with longstanding disease, such that pancolitis of 10 years duration or longer has a 20-to 30fold increased risk of cancer compared to the general population. Surveillance colonoscopies for patients at higher risk are routinely offered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Current Treatment Options for Ulcerative Colitis</head><p>Decisions about treatment of UC weigh such factors as disease activity, disease extent and duration, previous treatment attempts and the patient's preference. The goal is to stop the patient's active acute disease (induction of remission) and then maintain the patient in remission.</p><p>Aminosalicylate preparations, given orally, rectally or in combination, are the first line of treatment for induction of remission (aminosalicylates are approved to treat mildly or moderately active UC including, for certain products, maintenance of remission). Patients with mild-to-moderate UC that is refractory to aminosalicylates are often advanced to oral corticosteroids (approved to "tide the patient over a critical period") and immunosuppressive agents (e.g., azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine; widely used but unapproved). Use of any of the preceding has come to be considered part of "conventional therapy."</p><p>Currently, Remicade (infliximab) is the only TNFα-antagonist approved for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with moderately to severely active UC who have inadequate response to conventional therapy. Remicade has been shown to be effective in this population and has an acceptable safety profile; however, many patients do not respond initially, lose response over time, and/or develop intolerance.</p><p>Colectomy is still required for many when medical therapy fails or when epithelial dysplasia is found on surveillance. Total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is currently the procedure of choice because it preserves anal sphincter function. While the mortality of the procedure is low, long-term morbidity is not. Pouchitis, often intermittent and recurrent, is a prevalent problem with symptoms that include increased stool frequency, urgency, incontinence, seepage, and abdominal and perianal discomfort. End of Review Meeting: The sponsor discussed their approach in responding to the review issues in the End of Review Meeting (January 25, 2012). The sponsor proposed submitting additional analyses that explore the totality of the data, demonstrate the clinical meaningfulness of the clinical results, and support a favorable benefit/risk profile. The Division advised the sponsor that the resubmission would be accepted for review, but the multiple post hoc analyses proposed would be considered exploratory.</p><p>Advisory Committee Meeting: The application was presented to the Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee during the current review cycle (August 28, 2012) to seek recommendations on: (1) dose selection, (2) efficacy analysis; (3) additional pre-approval studies, (4) benefit-risk considerations, and (5) post-approval studies. The outcome of the meeting was as follows:</p><p>(1) Dose Selection: In response to the question of whether the optimal dose has been adequately established, 3 voted yes, and 14 voted no. (2) Efficacy Analysis: The Committee was asked to discuss the factors they consider in defining "clinically meaningful benefit" in this patient population; considerations included a specific magnitude of difference, steroid-sparing effect, and avoidance of colectomy. The Committee was asked if the observed treatment differences for clinical remission at Week 8, at Week 52, and at both Weeks 8 and 52, were clinically meaningful; the votes were as follows:</p><p>Week 8: Yes=15 votes; No=1 vote; Abstain=1 vote.</p><p>Week 52: Yes=16 votes; No=1 vote. Both Weeks 8 and 52: Yes=10 votes; No=6 votes; Abstain=1 vote. In addition, the Committee was asked if the endpoint of clinical remission at Week 52 represents a clinically meaningful endpoint; the votes were as follows: Yes=16 votes; No=1 vote.</p><p>(3) Additional Pre-Approval Studies: Regarding the question of whether there should be additional efficacy studies prior to approval for moderately to severely active UC, the Committee voted as follows: Yes=3 votes; No=13 votes; Abstain=1 vote. (4) Benefit-Risk Considerations: Regarding the question of whether the expected benefits outweigh the known and potential risks, the Committee voted as follows: Yes=15 votes; No=2 votes. (5) Post-Approval Studies: The Committee was asked to discuss studies that should be conducted post-approval if they believe this application should be approved.</p><p>Recommendations included exploration of higher doses, evaluation of the relationship between trough concentrations and clinical remission rates, and development of an improved immunogenicity assay.

However, the CMC Reviewer became aware during the first review cycle of this sBLA that samples from Study M06-827 (submitted for review in the sBLA) were assayed for serum anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) using a new immunogenicity method, while samples from Studies M02-403, M04-691 and M02-433 (studies submitted in a previous efficacy supplement for Crohn's disease) were measured for serum AAA using the original immunogenicity method approved under the original BLA.</p><p>The CMC Reviewer noted that the Clinical Pharmacology Reviewer raised a concern about the sensitivity of both AAA assays to product interference (i.e., neither the original nor the new AAA assay is able to appropriately measure AAA because of product interference) (see Section 5.1 of this CDTL Review). The CMC Reviewer concluded that an assay with improved drug tolerance should be developed.</p><p>The following was included in the CR Letter as an issue to be addressed (but was not considered an approvability issue):</p><p>The immunogenicity assay was not adequate because the original and new immunogenicity assays would not evaluate most patient samples appropriately due to the drug interference in the assays for anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) measurement. Therefore, there is a need to develop an assay with improved drug tolerance. To address this issue, you should develop, qualify and implement an improved validated AAA assay with reduced sensitivity to product interference. Provide a detailed description of the methodology and plans for validation of the assays that will be used for the detection of AAA. The qualification results should include data demonstrating that the assay is specific, sensitive and reproducible, and should include information on the sensitivity of the assay to drug interference. The validated assay should be capable of sensitively detecting AAA responses in the presence of adalimumab levels that are expected to be present at the time of patient sampling. Until assays have been developed and validated, patient samples collected from clinical studies should be banked under appropriate storage conditions. (See CR Letter in Appendix 2.)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Exposure-Response Analysis</head><p>Induction Phase:</p><p>The Clinical Pharmacology Reviewer noted that the exposure-response analysis conducted based on data from Study M06-827 suggested a higher induction dose could achieve a greater treatment effect for the induction of clinical remission at Week 8. The Clinical Pharmacology Reviewer stated that this conclusion is mainly based on two observations:</p><p>(1) There was an increased remission rate with increased exposures that did not plateau at higher exposures. A statistically-significant (p=0.0002) relationship was established between adalimumab Week 8 trough concentration and clinical remission at Week 8 using logistic regression. The figure below demonstrates the exposure-response relationship for clinical remission at Week 8 suggesting that higher exposures may be associated with a higher clinical remission rate. Thus, this finding suggests that a higher dose may produce additional benefit for inducing clinical remission. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine if the relationship between Week 8 adalimumab trough concentration and Week 8 clinical remission was confounded by baseline Mayo score and prior anti-TNF exposure. When adjusting for baseline Mayo score and prior exposure to anti-TNF therapy, the week 8 adalimumab trough concentration was still significant (p=0.0003). (2) Patients with lower exposures in the induction phase were unable to maintain response and switched to open-label treatment earlier than patients with higher exposures. The figure below demonstrates that subjects who had lower Week 8 adalimumab trough concentrations lost response earlier than the subjects with higher Week 8 concentrations. This provides additional evidence that exposures achieved by the 160/80/40 induction dose may not be sufficient to maintain response. Proportional hazards analysis showed that Week 8 concentrations are significantly associated with time to inadequate response after correcting for previous exposure to anti-TNF therapy at baseline and baseline Mayo score. Maintenance Phase:</p><p>The Clinical Pharmacology Reviewer concluded that a robust exposure-response relationship for the maintenance phase could not be established due to significant drop out and missing PK data. Although the model relating steady state adalimumab trough concentrations to</p><p>Week 52 remission demonstrates a weak trend in exposure-response (p=0.01, see figure below), suggesting a higher dose may provide additional benefit, the analysis is based on only 78 patients (31% of the total treatment population) who remained in the double-blind phase throughout the trial and had PK data. Other limitations noted by the Clinical Pharmacology Reviewer included the following: (a) The analysis dataset included nonremitters at Week 8. (b) Only a marginally significant (p=0.04) exposure-response relationship was observed using a logistic regression analysis that adjusted for baseline Mayo score and prior anti-TNF use. (c) The data used in this analysis may not be representative of the actual treatment population since the clinical remission rate is 33% (43/132) for patients who remained in the double-blind treatment phase compared to 50% (39/78) for subjects who remained in double blind phase and had PK data. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Immunogenicity</head><p>The Clinical Pharmacology Reviewer stated that no conclusions could be drawn regarding the impact of immunogenicity on pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and safety because only a small proportion of subjects had confirmed antibody status. The assessment of immunogenicity incidence was not adequate. The majority of subjects (74.4%, 268/360) had no immunogenicity assessment due to high drug concentration (≥ 2 mcg/mL) and they could not be ruled as negative. Among the subjects with immunogenicity assessed, antiadalimumab antibodies (AAA) were observed in 20.7% (19/92) of patients.</p><p>The Clinical Pharmacology Reviewer concluded that an assay with improved drug tolerance should be developed (see Section 3.1 of this CDTL Review) and/or post dose AAA samples should be collected at time points when the adalimumab concentrations would not be expected to interfere with the immunogenicity assay (i.e., adalimumab concentration ≤ 2 μg/mL).</p><p>The following was included in the CR Letter as an issue to be addressed (but was not considered an approvability issue):</p><p>The immunogenicity profile for adalimumab has not been adequately assessed. Utilizing a validated AAA assay as described in Item #1 above, you should assess the immunogenicity profile based on post-dose patient samples in which the adalimumab concentrations are not expected to interfere with the immunogenicity assay.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Item #1 (cont.): Dose Selection / Modest Improvements in Remission (826 and 827)</head><p>The Applicant's response to the concern about dose selection is discussed in the Clinical Pharmacology section (see Section 5). The Clinical Pharmacology Reviewer concluded that the exposure-response data (from Study 827) suggested that a higher induction dose would lead to a higher treatment effect. For maintenance, data were not sufficient to determine an exposure-response relationship. In addition, a question about dose selection was posed to the Advisory Committee (see <ref type="bibr">Sections 2.4 and 9)</ref>; in response to the question of whether the optimal dose has been adequately established, 3 voted yes, and 14 voted no.</p><p>The Applicant responded to the concern about the modest treatment differences observed in both studies by providing a number of supplemental and exploratory analyses that included the following: primary and secondary analyses of Study 826 using the ITT-E population (i.e., all patients enrolled that received study drug or placebo); integrated primary and secondary analyses across Studies 826 and 827; additional exploratory analyses from Study 827 (e.g., clinical response based on partial Mayo score at Weeks 2, 4, and 8); re-analysis of full and partial Mayo scores at Baseline and Week 52 using average of last 3 days (rather than standard "worst-ranked" methodology)-Study 827; exploratory analyses of clinical remission and clinical response status at Week 52 in the subgroup of patients from Study 827 in clinical response at Week 8; serious adverse event (SAE)-adjusted days in remission; number of patients who discontinued due to adverse events (AEs) relative to number of patients in remission at Weeks 8 and 52; Net Efficacy Adjusted Risk (NEAR) analysis; and Number Needed to Harm (NNH) analyses.</p><p>The supplemental and exploratory analyses were difficult to interpret because many of the endpoints and the precise methods of comparisons were not clearly defined prior to the start of the studies. Thus, although these analyses were included in the Meeting Materials for the Advisory Committee meeting and are included in this CDTL Review (see the Applicant's analyses and discussion in Appendix 7), the Advisory Committee questions and discussion as well as the clinical and statistical reviews focused on the analysis of the primary endpoints of each of the studies and the first-ranked secondary endpoint of Study 827 (sustained clinical remission).</p><p>The Committee was asked to discuss the factors they consider in defining "clinically meaningful benefit" in this patient population; considerations included a specific magnitude of difference, steroid-sparing effect, and avoidance of colectomy. The Committee was asked if the observed treatment differences for clinical remission at Week 8, at Week 52, and at both Weeks 8 and 52, were clinically meaningful; the votes were as follows: It should be noted further that consistent with the recommendations of the Advisory Committee, there will be a PMR for a trial to study a higher induction dose (see PMR #5 in Section 13.5) and a PMR for a trial to study trough concentrations and antibody levels at the time of loss of clinical remission in patients whose physicians plan to escalate the dose (see PMR #6 in Section 13.5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.2">Assessment of Applicant's Response to Other Issues (Not Approvability Issues)</head><p>A summary of the Clinical/Statistical Reviewers' assessment of the Applicant's response to Items #3a, 4a, 4b, and 4c in the CR Letter is presented below; these were not approvability issues. Also, this Reviewer's assessment is included below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Item #3a: Study 826 Secondary Endpoint Results and Subgroup Analysis by CRP</head><p>Secondary Endpoint Results of Study 826: In the initial review cycle, the statistical reviewer identified the concern about the lack of supportive evidence from the secondary endpoint results of Study 826 (i.e., first-ranked secondary endpoint was not statistically significant). The Applicant addressed the Statistical Reviewer's concern by presenting the primary and ranked secondary endpoints using the IAS-E population (the population that includes the ITT-E population of Study 826 and the ITT population of Study 827). The treatment differences in this exploratory analysis by the Applicant are all statistically significant in this pooled population (see Appendix 7 -Applicant's Analysis #3b). The statistical reviewer concluded that this is a post hoc and exploratory analysis and does not address his concern. This reviewer notes that although there was not supportive evidence from the secondary efficacy results of Study 826, there was supportive evidence from the secondary efficacy results of Study 827 (the first eight ranked secondary endpoints had statistically significant results) (see Section 7.1.2 of this CDTL Review). Thus, in this reviewer's opinion, this issue is not a concern. This reviewer further notes that this item was not deemed an approvability issue in the first review cycle.</p><p>Inconsistent Treatment Effects in Subgroup Analysis Based on CRP in Study 826: In the initial review cycle, the statistical reviewer identified the concern about inconsistent treatment effects in the subgroup analysis based on CRP (i.e., treatment difference of 13.4% in the CRP &lt;10 mg/L subgroup, and treatment difference of -4.5% in the CRP ≥ 10 mg/L subgroup). The Applicant addressed the Statistical Reviewer's concern by presenting the subgroup analysis based on CRP using the IAS-E population (treatment difference of 10.5% in the CRP &lt; 10 mg/L subgroup, and treatment difference of 1.7% in the CRP ≥ 10 mg/L subgroup). The statistical reviewer concluded that this is a post hoc and exploratory analysis and does not address his concern. This reviewer notes that although there appeared to be inconsistent treatment effects in the subgroup analysis based on CRP in Study 826, this was not observed in Study 827. In Study 827, there were consistent treatment effects observed in the subgroup analysis based on CRP at Week 8 (i.e., treatment difference of 7.6% in the CRP &lt;10 mg/L subgroup, and treatment difference of 5.1% in the CRP ≥ 10 mg/L subgroup) and at Week 52 (i.e., treatment difference of 8.7% in the CRP &lt;10 mg/L subgroup, and treatment difference of 8.0% in the CRP ≥ 10 mg/L subgroup) (see Appendix 5 of this CDTL Review). Thus, in this reviewer's opinion, this issue is not a concern. This reviewer further notes that this item was not deemed an approvability issue in the first review cycle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Item #4a: Study 827 Robustness of Sustained Remission Results and Missing Data</head><p>Robustness of Sustained Clinical Remission Results: In the initial review cycle, the statistical reviewer noted that the sustained clinical remission endpoint is sensitive to alternative analyses (e.g., Fishers exact test, p=0.062). It should be noted that the original statistical analysis was based on the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test. The Applicant addressed the Statistical Reviewer's concern by using the alternative methodology of logistic regression with treatment group as the factor; based on this analysis, the statistical significance remained (p=0.048). The statistical reviewer commented that it is not clear if the use of anti-TNF agents was used as a covariate in the Applicant's logistic regression analysis as detailed results were not provided. In addition, the statistical reviewer noted that the logistical regression method involves statistical models, and the fundamental assumptions for modeling methods are debatable. The secondary statistical reviewer noted that observed case and complete case sensitivity analyses were also done, and these showed a numerical trend in favor of Humira. This reviewer further notes that this item was not deemed an approvability issue in the first review cycle.</p><p>Missing Data: In the initial review cycle, the Statistical Reviewer noted that the high rates of early drop-outs (78% placebo vs. 69% adalimumab) undermine reliance on the estimated treatment effect, and the higher placebo rate would tend to produce bias in favor of the study drug. The Applicant addressed the Statistical Reviewer's concern by noting the rules for escape (i.e., moving to open label Humira treatment). These rules were as follows:</p><p>Partial Mayo score ≥ Baseline score on 2 consecutive visits at least 14 days apart (for subjects with a Partial Mayo score of 4 to 7 at Baseline). Partial Mayo score ≥ 7 on 2 consecutive visits at least 14 days apart (for subjects with a Partial Mayo score of 8 or 9 at Baseline). The applicant noted that the higher dropout rate for placebo was due to a higher rate of open label escape in the placebo group (55% in the placebo group versus 47% in the Humira group) (see table below); the applicant noted that the higher rate of escape in the placebo group may be due to inadequate response and lack of efficacy. Thus, the applicant concluded that the elevated rate of dropout in the placebo group versus the Humira group would not undermine overall conclusions which support the overall superiority of Humira over placebo. treatment difference of 8.3% in the baseline Azathioprine or 6-MP use subgroup, and treatment difference of 9.0 % in the no baseline Azathioprine or 6-MP use subgroup) (see Appendix 5 of this CDTL Review). For the Week 8 endpoint in Study 826, there were consistent treatment effects observed in the subgroup analysis based on baseline Azathioprine or 6-MP use (i.e., treatment difference of 11.9% in the baseline Azathioprine or 6-MP use subgroup, and treatment difference of 7.5 % in the no baseline Azathioprine or 6-MP use subgroup) (see Appendix 4 of this CDTL Review). Thus, in this reviewer's opinion, this issue is not a concern. This reviewer further notes that this item was not deemed an approvability issue in the first review cycle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Item #4c: Study 827 Not Designed to Demonstrate Maintenance of Clinical Remission</head><p>In the initial review cycle, the statistical reviewer identified the concern that a study design intending to show maintenance of clinical remission should re-randomize patients that achieve induction of clinical remission, and noted that the Applicant's first ranked secondary endpoint of sustained clinical remission is a measure of durability in contrast to maintenance. The Applicant addressed the statistical reviewer's concern by proposing revised indication wording of "achieving clinical remission" instead of the earlier proposal in the initial submission of "inducing and maintaining induction of clinical remission." In the current review cycle, the clinical reviewer agreed with the use of "inducing and sustaining clinical remission" to replace the Applicant's proposed wording for the indication (see Section 12 of this CDTL Review). This reviewer agrees that the proposed revised indication wording addresses this issue.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1">First Review Cycle</head><p>Below is summarized the safety data at the time of the initial review of the sBLA submission. More information is provided in the first cycle CDTL review by Anil Rajpal and the first cycle Clinical Review by Aisha Peterson Johnson.</p><p>Exposure: Across all three studies, the mean duration of exposure to Humira was 542.5 days (range 14 to 1,475 days). Of the 1,010 patients in the All Humira Set, 60.0% (606) used Humira for greater than 12 months, 49.6% were exposed for greater than 18 months, and 35.4% were exposed for greater than 24 months.</p><p>Deaths: There was one death reported in the three studies submitted in this Application. The patient (72902) died at age 36 on Day 543 of Humira (9 days after his last dose). He was a Caucasian male randomized to Humira 160/80/40 mg in Study 827 and continued on Humira in Study 223. During this study, the patient dose-escalated to Humira 40 every week. The patient had a non-serious event of flu syndrome, head pain, body aches, and fever 3 days prior to his death. He was found in respiratory arrest by his mother and transferred to a hospital where resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful. Autopsy revealed a bilateral adrenal hemorrhage secondary to an infectious process, the etiology of which could not be determined from the autopsy. The death was considered possibly related to study drug. Serious Adverse Events: Serious adverse events (SAEs) are summarized below by Induction Set, Maintenance Set, and All Humira Set:</p><p>Induction Set: During the 8 week induction periods of Studies 826 and 827, a total of 610 patients were exposed to Humira. SAEs were reported in 5 patients <ref type="formula">(</ref>  The Clinical Reviewer concluded that no new safety signals were identified in review of the sBLA, and that known events associated with the use of Humira appear to be adequately represented in current labeling. In addition, the Clinical Reviewer concluded that there was no clear trend of higher incidence of AEs with increasing Humira dose seen in the UC studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2">Current Review Cycle</head><p>For additional information, see the Current Cycle Clinical Review by Klaus Gottlieb.</p><p>The Clinical Reviewer noted that since the initial submission no new safety signals have become apparent. However, the total number of deaths has increased from 1 to 4 since the first cycle review.</p><p>No deaths were reported in Studies 826 or 827. There were 4 deaths (0.2 events/100 PYs)</p><p>reported in the open-label portion of the UC clinical program through 15 April 2012. Two deaths were treatment-emergent, and 2 deaths were post-treatment (defined as greater than 70 days after last adalimumab dose). The first treatment-emergent death was described above (see Section 8.1). The second treatment-emergent death and the two post-treatment deaths are summarized below. The Clinical Reviewer concluded that no new safety signals were identified in review of the sBLA, and that known events associated with the use of Humira appear to be adequately represented in current labeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.3">Recommendation</head><p>An Approval Action is the final recommendation from a Safety standpoint.</p><p>A PMR is recommended for a study to bank samples for future evaluation to identify genetic mutations and other biomarkers that predispose IBD patients to developing Hepatosplenic T-Cell Lymphoma (HSTCL). See PMR #1 in Section 13.5.</p><p>A PMR is recommended for a multi-center observational study of Humira (adalimumab) in adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis treated in a routine clinical setting, to assess the long-term safety as measured by the incidence of opportunistic infections and malignancies. Long-term effectiveness should be assessed as a secondary goal. The proposed study should follow patients for a period of at least 10 years from time of enrollment in order to ascertain adverse events with longer latency periods such as malignancies. The primary analysis is to summarize safety data for patients on adalimumab and patients on non-biologic immunomodulator therapy. The study should be adequately sized to sufficiently detect a doubling of the risk of lymphoma events in each treatment group. A secondary analysis is to summarize safety data for patients on adalimumab and patients on the combination of adalimumab and non-biologic immunomodulator therapy. In addition, the study is to document and evaluate effects of withdrawal and re-treatment with adalimumab and "switching" with other tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-blockers or biologics.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Advisory Committee Meeting</head><p>A meeting of the Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee (GIDAC) was convened to discuss this application on August 28, 2012.</p><p>The questions posed to the GIDAC, the results of voting, and a summary of the discussion that took place are provided below:</p><p>1. Dose Selection:</p><p>VOTE: Based on the exposure-response data and observed treatment effect presented, has the optimal Humira dose for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) been adequately established? Please comment on the need for further dose exploration.</p><p>Voting Results: YES=3; NO=14; ABSTAIN=0 Discussion: Those voting "Yes" commented that while the dose studied is clinically effective for anti-TNF naïve patients, an optimal dose has not been fully established. It was also noted that while the current dosing schedule was clinically effective in some patients, others required a higher dose of 40mg every week. The committee noted that the sponsor had requested for the product label to allow a higher dose in non responders. Such variable dosing is likely to minimize risk in responders, while allowing others to receive higher doses for clinical effectiveness. There were also comments that a post marketing dose ranging study was required.</p><p>Those who voted "No" noted that the optimal dosing for this drug has not been fully explored given FDA's concentration response analysis. Although the dosage used demonstrated clinical efficacy, the therapeutic effect continued to rise and did not plateau for the doses studied. It was commented that a higher dose study may have facilitated a better response; hence a post approval dose response study is needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Efficacy Analysis (Studies 826 and 827):</head><p>(a) DISCUSSION: Please discuss the factors that you consider in defining the term "clinically meaningful benefit" in patients with moderately to severely active UC.</p><p>Voting Results: Not applicable as this is not a voting question.</p><p>Discussion: Panel members expressed a range of opinions on this issue. Statistically significant clinical efficacy alone does not imply "clinically meaningful benefit". Such results require interpretation within the context of disease burden, safety, availability of other therapies and the therapeutic pipeline. Hence, a certain magnitude of difference between placebo and treatment groups assessed either by way of a delta or odds ratio or relative risk cannot alone determine "clinically meaningful benefit". Safety of Humira was of particular concern to some panel members; and in particular, the long term safety of the drug had not been fully evaluated. The impact of the disease on the quality of life and the need for alternative therapies were noteworthy concerns in other opinions. The steroid sparing effects or colectomy avoiding attributes of the drug were of significant importance. Patient age, duration of disease, length of therapy, and convenience of dosing were also mentioned as factors to consider. In summary, "clinically meaningful" is a subjective measure, and apart from risk benefit analysis, is dependent on patient (and physician) preferences and their risk tolerance. Within the advisory committee there was variance in the comfort level with the risk-benefit trade off in the context of clinical effectiveness. While there was unanimity regarding the lack of long term safety record for this specific indication, given the track record of this drug for other medical conditions, most members were willing to accept the safety concerns, and endorse it despite its marginal effectiveness for UC. Discussion: Those voting "Yes" commented about unmet need, compliance, and convenience issues, which favored having adalimumab as a treatment option. The study did show statistical significance as compared to placebo, at week 8, albeit the differences being marginal. One member noted the long record of use of this drug and of the class of drugs. Several noted that currently given few treatment choices, adalimumab would be another option, especially for difficult to treat patients. Committee members hence endorsed Humira voting that it resulted in clinically meaningful benefit. Even the marginal benefit was acceptable given the high disease burden with regards to its impact on quality of life.</p><p>The member who voted "No" commented that although Week 8 results are statistically significant, it failed to meet the member's assessment of clinically meaningful because of inadequate information on durability of response and safety.</p><p>It was also noted that the data suggest that it is best to use adalimumab as an alternative to Remicade as opposed to salvage therapy following Remicade. Data thus far suggests that benefits following Remicade are modest.</p><p>The member who voted "Abstain" commented that there wasn't enough information to provide a reliable answer and also commented that the answer could be "yes" if it could be determined that there weren't substantive safety issues, that the drug effect is durable, evidence was present to indicate adalimumab is effective in patients not adequately controlled by existing therapies, and that such data were reliable. However, the probability of "No" appeared much more likely then a "Yes," hence the abstention. Discussion: The members who voted "Yes" commented that Week 52 as a marker for durability of effect is a meaningful endpoint. It was also commented that remission is at the top of the list of what patients want to see.</p><p>The member who voted "No" commented that interpreting the question as related to the practicality of obtaining long-term data reliably, while desirable, is logistically challenging. To successfully conduct a trial of such a long duration given the likelihood of significant drop out rates and loss to follow up, without adversely impacting reliable and meaningful results is difficult.</p><p>(ii) VOTE: Does the observed treatment difference in the proportion of patients that had clinical remission at Week 52 of 8.8% (95% CI: 2.9%, 14.8%) (Study 827) represent a clinically meaningful benefit? (please explain your vote)</p><p>Voting Results: YES=15; NO=1; ABSTAIN=1 Discussion: The members who voted "Yes" commented that the decision was made mainly on reasons discussed previously and due to durability of sustained response. One member noted that this is a more significant finding, showing consistency of continued exposure. Most members agreed that the result is clinically relevant at Week 52.</p><p>The member who voted "No" commented that the data does not represent clinically meaningful benefit and is not confident in the interpretation of the data at Week 52. It was also noted that the durability issue is not answered because it is a cross sectional look.</p><p>The member who voted "Abstain" noted that the decision was arrived for the same reasons as Question 2b. It was noted that the vote could be "Yes" if the agent was truly safe and if we knew the value of 8.8% was real and a vote could be "No" because we can't conclude there isn't a real risk for malignancy and serious infection. Discussion: Members voting "Yes" commented that the magnitude of effect is disappointing, but does seem meaningful given the subset of patients who are difficult to treat. Some members expressed concerns regarding missing data for long term safety, but noted that benefits were seen.</p><p>The members who voted "No" commented that because of the unknown about safety and missing data, the answer could not be a Yes. It was also noted that the value of 4.4% for durability is very low for an agent that has the risks that are known.</p><p>One member voted "Abstain" for reasons that the magnitude of effect is disappointing but a rigorous endpoint and that the 4.4% is difficult to interpret when explaining the trial results to a patient.</p><p>3. Additional Pre-Approval Studies:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VOTE:</head><p>Are there additional efficacy studies that should be conducted prior to approving Humira for moderately to severely active UC? (please explain your vote)</p><p>Voting Results: YES=3; NO=13; ABSTAIN=1 Discussion: Those who voted "Yes" commented that we need to further explore efficacy, safety, and dose. One member commented on the need for randomization trials involving patients with inadequate response or intolerance to existing therapy.</p><p>Those who voted "No" commented that there are studies needed, but not for approval of the medication and the approval should not be held up for the proposed indication. Most of these members expressed the need for post approval dosing and safety trials.</p><p>One member abstained from voting due to unclear phrasing and noted the contingency of approval should not be dependent on efficacy studies, but the medication should be tailored to specific patient populations and more studies are necessary, especially looking at the safety profile.</p><p>One member who had originally voted "Yes," subsequently noted during the explanation of the vote that she wanted to vote "No" and did not feel there is a need for additional studies before approval, but does want to see post approval studies and sub population response to adalimumab. The vote count above records her vote as "Yes".</p></div>

If YES, specify whether your answer is limited to particular population(s) defined by level of disease severity or inadequate response/intolerance to prior therapies.</p><p>(please explain your vote) Voting Results: YES=15; NO=2; ABSTAIN=0 Discussion: Those who voted "Yes" commented that benefits outweigh the risks in various populations, given earlier discussions. The efficacy extended to patients intolerant to other anti-TNF therapies, anti-TNF naïve patients, those not responding to other conventional therapies, and populations with moderately to severely active disease.</p><p>A few members noted that there is not enough data at this point to limit to certain populations.</p><p>Those who voted "No" commented that there are modest effects, but also uncertain durability and uncertain dose. One member also noted the lack of confidence in week 52 data.</p></div>

It was also noted that in addition to the need for exploration of drug dosage issues, the mechanism of action of the drug needs to be looked at more in depth.</p><p>The panel also wanted to see studies which will explore when to introduce a drug of this class, who is likely to benefit, and reasons for loss of response (i.e. immunogenicity or dose related). There were comments on the need for studies in young adults/teenage population especially in terms of safety and also gender specific responses.</p><p>The need for studies evaluating the correlation of serum trough levels with clinical effectiveness was noted. Also, it was pointed out that anti-adalimumab antibody measurements were not standardized and clinically available. The sponsor commented that they were committed to developing an improved immunogenicity assay and to have it made available shortly.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.6">Recommendation for Postmarketing Study Commitments (PMCs)</head><p>The postmarketing commitment below is recommended:</p><p>PMC #7 Conduct a one-year, multi-center, randomized, double-blind placebocontrolled trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. In this trial, the efficacy of adalimumab should be assessed during induction treatment as well as during continued treatment after induction, and pharmacokinetic measurements should be conducted for exposure-response analysis. Also, collect samples for immunogenicity testing (utilizing a validated AAA assay as described in PMR #3 above) and conduct analyses of the impact of immunogenicity on pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety. The protocol should be agreed upon by the agency prior to the initiation of the trial.  First, although both trials demonstrated statistically significant improvement for adalimumab treatment relative to placebo, we note that statistical significance is lost in Study M06-826 if the responder status of 1 patient in the adalimumab 160/80/40 group is changed from responder to non-responder, or if the responder status of 1 placebo-treated patient is changed from non-responder to responder. Although the clinical remission rate at Week 8 in the adalimumab 160/80/40 treatment group for Study M06-826 was statistically higher than that in the placebo group (18.5% vs. 9.2%, p=0.031), these results are sensitive to alternative analyses, and the conclusions are not considered robust from a statistical perspective. For example, adjusting the primary analysis for the significantly different baseline Mayo scores, the treatment differences were not significant (p=0.085). Moreover the significance of the analysis results is sensitive to the use of exact testing methods.</p><p>Second, we are concerned that you may not have adequately selected an appropriate adalimumab dose for your pivotal efficacy trials. We note the modest improvement in clinical remission rates reported in both trials (treatment differences relative to placebo in clinical remission at Week 8 of 9.3% and 7.2% in Studies M06-826 and M06-827, respectively), and the treatment difference relative to placebo in sustained clinical remission (at both Weeks 8 and 52) of 4.4% in Study M06-827.</p><p>To address these concerns, we will need to seek expert advice at a future meeting of the Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FACILITY INSPECTIONS</head><p>3. During a recent inspection of the facility for this application, our field investigator conveyed deficiencies to the representative of the facility. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required before this application may be approved.</p><p>Other Issues (Not Approvability Issues): IMMUNOGENICITY 1. The immunogenicity assay was not adequate because the original and new immunogenicity assays would not evaluate most patient samples appropriately due to the drug interference in the assays for anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) measurement. Therefore, there is a need to develop an assay with improved drug tolerance. To address this issue, you should develop, qualify and implement an improved validated AAA assay with reduced sensitivity to product interference. Provide a detailed description of the methodology and plans for validation of the assays that will be used for the detection of AAA. The qualification results should include data demonstrating that the assay is specific, sensitive and reproducible, and should include information on the sensitivity of the assay to drug interference. The validated assay should be capable of sensitively detecting AAA responses in the presence of adalimumab levels that are expected to be present at the time of patient sampling. Until assays have been developed and validated, patient samples collected from clinical studies should be banked under appropriate storage conditions.</p><p>2. The immunogenicity profile for adalimumab has not been adequately assessed. Utilizing a validated AAA assay as described in Item #1 above, you should assess the immunogenicity profile based on post-dose patient samples in which the adalimumab concentrations are not expected to interfere with the immunogenicity assay.        In the pre-specified Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), full Mayo (FM) scores were calculated using worst-rank methodology (i.e. the worst subscore from the past 3 days of the patient subject diary for Stool Frequency Score (SFS) and Rectal Bleeding Score (RBS) was used to calculate the Mayo score for each visit). To evaluate the possible impact of worst score versus average score methodology in Study 827, the Applicant undertook an exploratory analysis of selected patients from sites with readily-available diary data and re-calculated FM scores using the average SFS and RBS subscores from the three days prior to each visit.</p><p>To conduct this analysis, the Applicant included patients who had completed Study 827 and were currently participating in the long-term Study 223. The Applicant included three to four patients from each of the thirteen sites who reported still having readily-available diary data of both placebo and Humira patients. In the end, data from only 16 patients was used for this analysis. The results of this exploratory analysis revealed that using the average method to calculate SFS and RBS (instead of the worst-rank method) may have resulted in Week 52 FM and PM scores that were 0.59 points lower. See <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 28</ref>, below. The analysis was completed with data from only 16 of the 494 patients who participated in Study 827. The Clinical Reviewer concluded that with such a small sample size, no meaningful information can be obtained. In addition, the Clinical Reviewer concluded that these data cannot be relied upon for statistical inference given their post-hoc nature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applicant's Analysis #7: All-Cause and UC-related Hospitalizations (Pooled Across Studies 826 and 827)</head><p>In a further exploratory analysis, the Applicant presented pooled data from Studies 826 and 827 to evaluate hospitalization rates with active drug and placebo. As previously pointed out, these two studies had significant design differences that make pooling of data for efficacy analysis highly problematic. The chief concerns are that patients in Study 826 were naïve to TNF-alpha-antagonists whereas 40 % of subjects in Study 827 were anti-TNF-experienced. Moreover, a protocol change (Amendment 3) in Study 826 led to the addition of the lower dose treatment arm. The hospitalizations of these patients were not used for the Applicant's hospitalization analysis because they "did not perform significantly better than subjects randomized to placebo for the primary endpoint." 4 Whether this is a valid reason is arguable:</p><p>(1) This is a post-hoc justification; (2) a lower dose may not translate into an improvement in the Mayo score (primary endpoint), however, it may stabilize the patient enough to prevent a hospitalization.</p><p>While the Applicant presents data from several different sensitivity analyses which support their general conclusion (patients on active drug have fewer hospitalizations), other types of sensitivity analyses are not given: For example, results broken out by individual studies (826 and 827 not pooled) would be of interest and also an analysis that keeps patients on the low dose arm in Study 826 (pre-amendment) in the analysis.</p><p>The tables below are given for the purpose of reference.  The Applicant performed an exploratory analysis adjusting the days of clinical remission for days of serious adverse events (SAEs) leading to treatment discontinuation in Study 827. In this analysis, the mean days of SAEs leading to treatment discontinuation was subtracted from days of clinical remission. Despite the mean duration of SAEs being similar between the Humira 180/60 and placebo groups (4.11 and 4.64 days, respectively), the difference in SAE-adjusted days in clinical remission was statistically significantly different between groups. This difference is driven by the large difference in days of clinical remission (85.32 vs. 52.87 days in the Humira and placebo groups, respectively; p-value &lt; 0.001). Therefore, it is unclear what additional information the SAE-adjusted analysis of days of clinical remission provides beyond what can be inferred from the analysis that only considered days of clinical remission. Furthermore, the clinical meaningfulness of this analysis is unclear given the pooling of all SAE time without accounting for type of event and the timing of the event in relation to clinical remission, if remission occurred.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applicant's Analysis #10: Number of Patients who Discontinued Due to Adverse Events Relative to Number of Patients in Remission at Weeks 8 and 52</head><p>The Applicant conducted an exploratory analysis of Study 827 comparing the proportion of patients who achieved clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52 between treatment groups relative to those that had any AE that led to treatment discontinuation. For the individual endpoints, the ADA group had more subjects in clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52 (21 vs. 10, ADA and placebo respectively; Fisher p-value = 0.062) and fewer patients who discontinued due to an AE (22 vs. 30, ADA and placebo respectively; Fisher p-value=0.244). From these frequencies, the Applicant estimates that for every placebo subject who achieved clinical remission at both week 8 and week 52, 3.0 placebo subjects discontinued due to AEs; for ADA, the ratio is 1.0. The clinical meaningfulness of the ratios is unclear. This approach lumps together all AEs that led to treatment discontinuation and therefore lacks in specificity of AE. This approach of lumping events can obscure imbalances between treatment groups for individual AEs.</p><p>The Applicant included a summary risk benefit measure, which is the ratio of the bytreatment risk to benefit ratios <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table 34)</ref>. Specifically, the ratio of risk of discontinuing treatment due to AE to clinical remission in the placebo and ADA group is 30/10 (3.0) and 22/21 (1.0), respectively. The Applicant interprets this ratio as "placebo subjects are three times more likely to experience an AE leading to discontinuation than ADA subjects for the same level of clinical efficacy (measured by achieving clinical remission at Week 8 and Week 52)". The interpretation of this ratio of ratios is problematic for the following reasons: 1) the proportion of clinical efficacy differs between treatment groups, 2) this analysis does not fix the level of clinical efficacy in the estimation, and 3) this analysis assumes a one-toone exchangeability for the efficacy and safety outcomes.</p><p>These same issues apply to the Applicant's risk benefit ratio obtained for subjects who discontinued treatment prematurely relative to the number of subjects in clinical remission at week 8 and clinical response at week 52 (results not presented). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applicant's Analysis #11: Net Efficacy Adjusted Risk (NEAR) Analysis</head><p>The Applicant conducted an exploratory analysis combining clinical efficacy and safety into a single estimate. Their approach redefined the efficacy endpoint by only considering subjects with the efficacy response who also did not experience a particular safety event (i.e. a specific safety event-free treatment success). The odds of experiencing a safety event-free treatment success in the ADA group were then compared to the odds in the placebo group.</p><p>The Applicant referred to this analysis as the Net Efficacy Adjusted for Risk (NEAR), which is discussed in a paper by Boada and colleagues 6,7 . The Applicant interprets a NEAR OR larger than one as a benefit-risk ratio in favor of ADA compared to placebo. Using pooled data from the placebo and ADA 160/80/40 mg group from Studies 826 and 827 (IAS-E analysis set), NEAR ORs were calculated for clinical response per Full Mayo (FM) and Partial Mayo (PM) score at Week 8 for the following two safety events: serious infections, and SAEs (which included serious infections).</p><p>Beyond issues raised previously about lumping together various safety endpoints and performing a pooled analysis, the ability of this NEAR analysis to quantify benefit-risk in a clinically meaningful way is highly questionable. The limitations of this approach are threefold. First, this approach implicitly assumes that the clinical benefit of having a clinical response is of equal importance/weight as experiencing a specific safety event. Such an assumption was not justified by the Applicant and is likely inappropriate due to the varying degree of safety events considered. The implication of this one-to-one exchange of efficacy 6 Boada JN, Boada C, García-Saíz M, et al. Net Efficacy Adjusted for Risk (NEAR): a simple procedure for measuring risk:benefit balance. PLoS One. 2008;3(10):e3580). 7 The NEAR approach described in the publication is considered flawed. By obtaining expected counts from the marginal event counts, one is implicitly assuming that the efficacy and safety endpoints are independent. Such an assumption is incorrect and was not discussed in the source article. Further, as a consequence of their approach, if group A has a greater percentage of patients with a positive efficacy endpoint and fewer AEs compared to group B, with probability 1 the odds of treatment group A will be larger than the odds for group B (i.e., the OR&gt;1).</p><p>In addition, the Applicant's NEAR analysis differs from the approach described in the paper by Boada et al <ref type="bibr">(2008)</ref>. The difference is that the Applicant uses the observed number of subject that had an AE-free treatment success, whereas the source publication uses the expected numbers based on the marginal event counts within treatment groups.</p><p>for safety is illustrated by considering two hypothetical examples. In the first example, suppose that one ADA randomized study patient died. Using the NEAR approach, the estimated NEAR OR would differ minimally from the estimated OR from an analysis of only efficacy ignoring the potential safety concerns. In the second example, consider the week 8 remission analysis (per FM) which has 180/468 responses in the placebo group and 241/471 in the ADA group. Suppose there were 61 SAEs all occurring in the ADA group and they all occurred in patients that had a clinical response. In this case, the number of SAE-free treatment successes in the ADA group is 180/471 compared to 180/468 for placebo. In this extreme scenario (which has an alarming safety signal), per this approach and the Applicant's interpretation, the NEAR OR would be below one suggesting ADA has an unfavorable benefit-risk ratio; however, if there were 60 (or fewer) SAEs (still a large signal), the ADA group would have a favorable benefit-risk ratio. These examples suggest incongruence between the proposed quantification of benefit-risk (based on an adapted version of the NEAR) to how clinical benefit is considered along with risk.</p><p>A second limitation is that the comparison only contrasts the favorable aspects of benefitrisk, i.e. the numerator value is based on patients with clinical benefit and who did not experience the specific safety event of interest. Other aspects of benefit-risk that can be obtained from the cross-classification of the efficacy response and safety event, such as the proportion of patients that did not have a clinical response (e.g. no remission) but did have an AE that led to treatment discontinuation, are not presented in the Applicant's NEAR analysis.</p><p>A third limitation is that the comparison only considers short-term efficacy with short-term risk. The problem with this is that short-term efficacy assessment is not done without also considering long-term risk when one assesses the overall risk benefit of a product. The failure of the analysis to incorporate temporal considerations, in addition to the above points, is sufficient reason to question the results from this analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applicant's Analysis #12: Number Needed to Harm (NNH) Analysis</head><p>The number needed to harm (NNH) corresponds to the number of patients needed to treat with Humira compared to placebo to result in one adverse event (SAE, AE leading to discontinuation, serious infections and malignancies). Estimates were derived by taking the inverse of the risk difference (1/difference of proportions) based on pooled data from the UC studies or from combined data from the UC and CD studies. Several point estimates were provided by the sponsor; however, it is unclear how clinically meaningful these values are without inclusion of confidence intervals, considering estimates when including data on all Humira exposures (not just on exposure to the Humira 160/80 treatment group) and understanding the type of events included (e.g. category of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation lacks in specificity of event).</p><p>The table below provides estimates of the NNH based on combined data from the two UC studies (826 and 827) using data collected up to 52 weeks. Two estimates are provided; one based on the inverse of the difference in proportion of events between placebo and the Humira 180/60 group and the second between placebo and all Humira. In addition, 95% CI (based on asymptotic method) are included to provide a measure of variability around the NNH estimates. The proportion of all SAEs in the placebo and Humira 160/80 groups are 10.1% and 8.3% respectively resulting NNH of -55 (1/(0.083-0.101)) with a 95% CI <ref type="bibr">(-18, 53)</ref>. This suggests a lower risk of SAE (when holding all other outcomes constant) in the Humira group. Also, note that the confidence intervals around several estimates presented in the table include infinity suggesting that the possibility of no difference between regimens cannot be ruled out. The sponsor also provided estimates on the number needed to treat (NNT) for clinical remission, response, mucosal healing and IBDQ response. The issues raised above also apply to these analyses of NNT along with limitations in pooling data for efficacy assessments.</p><p>- <ref type="figure">------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</ref>--This is a representation of an electronic record that was signed electronically and this page is the manifestation of the electronic signature.   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">BENEFIT ASSESSMENT .....................................</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">INTRODUCTION AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND .......................................</ref>  <ref type="figure">..................................................................................................</ref>  <ref type="figure">....................................................................</ref>  <ref type="figure">.....................................................................................</ref>  <ref type="figure">.........................................................................................</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">............................................................................ 30   9 APPENDICES ......................................................................................................</ref> </p></div>

This recommendation is based on a review of the original prior-approval efficacy supplement to the BLA (sBLA) for Humira (adalimumab) that was initially submitted on January 25, 2011, the resubmission, received March 30, 2012, which is the sponsor's response to FDA's Complete Response (CR) letter, and deliberations during the Gastrointestinal Drug Advisory Committee (GIDAC) August 28, 2012 in Silver Spring, MD, as well as internal meetings with the review team.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Risk Benefit Assessment</head><p>Moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) is a serious chronic condition, which significantly affects the quality of life and long-term health status of patients. When pharmacological therapies fail, colectomy may be required.</p><p>Remicade (infliximab) is currently the only FDA-approved therapeutic option for patients with moderate to severe UC who have failed conventional therapies. It is an effective treatment, but has serious known risks that are not specific to infliximab but apply to other TNF-alpha-blockers as well.</p><p>Conventional treatment options for patients with UC consist of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. When these fail, the remaining options are limited. A second TNF-alpha blocker option would therefore be valuable if risks are balanced by efficacy.</p><p>The induction of remission studies (826, 827) had limitations which were detailed before and provided evidence of only a modest or marginal population effect (&lt; 10% over placebo) on induction of remission. This reviewer and other members of the review team questioned the clinical meaningfulness of the magnitude of the observed treatment difference.</p><p>There was only one maintenance study. It was designed to measure "sustained clinical remission", not "maintenance of remission" because patients who achieved clinical remission during the induction phase continued on the respective treatment instead of being rerandomized to placebo or Humira. The maintenance study (study 827) suggests only a weak effect (&lt;5% over placebo) in the population. The reviewers questioned the clinical meaningfulness of the magnitude of the observed treatment difference. As we are evaluating the clinical meaningfulness of the effect size of drugs, it is natural to do so considering our historical experience with similar drugs for the same indication. Despite many caveats, it can reasonably be stated that study ACT 1 that evaluated induction of remission in patients with moderately to severe ulcerative colitis with Remicade (infliximab) and study 826 (adalimumab) were similar in design and demographic factors. ACT 1 had clinical response and not clinical remission as the primary endpoint, and the placebo response rate in ACT 1 was slightly higher. Also, in study 826 there appeared to be more patients that were not on steroids or immunosuppressants upon entry. The effect size for the induction of remission was 23.9 % for infliximab (95% CI: 13.0% -34.6%) and 9.3 % (95% CI: CI 0.8% -17.9%) for adalimumab.</p><p>Although limited, the data in study 827 suggest that there is no advantage of Humira for induction of clinical remission in patients who lost response to or were intolerant to another TNF blocker; patients in this subgroup did not appear to achieve induction of clinical remission at a higher rate with Humira than with placebo.</p><p>Based on intensive discussions over the last several months the review team and this reviewer have identified a number of recommended postmarketing requirements and commitments.</p><p>1. A study to bank samples for future evaluation to identify genetic mutations and other biomarkers that predispose inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)patients to developing Hepatosplenic T-Cell Lymphoma (HSTCL). 2. A multi-center study of Humira in adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis treated in a routine clinical setting to assess the long-term safety of serious infections and malignancies and long-term effectiveness in a comparative registry. 3. A safety and pharmacokinetic trial as a substudy of the trial described in #4 to evaluate trough concentrations and antibody levels at the time of loss of clinical remission in patients whose physicians plan to escalate the dose (e.g., decrease the dosing interval to weekly or increase the dosage) in response to loss of remission. 4. A trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of induction regimens at doses higher than 160/80 mg. In this trial, the efficacy of adalimumab should be assessed with induction treatment as well as during continued treatment after induction, and pharmacokinetic measurements should be conducted for exposure response analysis. Also, collect immunogenicity samples and conduct analyses of the impact of immunogenicity on pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety. 5. Development, qualification, and validation of an improved anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) assays with reduced sensitivity to product interference. 6. Utilizing a validated AAA assay as described in PMC #5 above, the sponsor should assess the immunogenicity profile based on post-dose patient samples This reviewer's assessment of the risk-benefit assessment for Humira for an ulcerative colitis indication was skeptical prior to the GIDAC and changed to favorable afterwards based on the input of other practicing gastroenterologists and experts in the field of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

This research topic is essentially similar to this reviewer's question (section 1.2) how Humira may be best used in patients who are naïve to TNF-alpha blockers or those who are currently on a TNF-alpha-blocker and want or need to switch. This reviewer agrees with these recommendations. A cohort study correlating patients response and remission status with drug and antibody levels could be a component of such a study.</p><p>Additional postmarketing studies should include the evaluation of efficacy in children and adolescents (the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA) does not apply due to the orphan status of the drug) and a long-term registry or observational cohort study exploring the risk of being on Humira vs. immunosuppressants.</p></div>

They are often discussed together as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) which minimizes important distinctions. In those geographic areas where both diseases are prevalent, especially North America and Europe, UC has a higher incidence (1.2 to 20.3 cases per 100,000 persons per year) than Crohn's disease (0.03 to 15.6 cases per 100,000 persons per year). Unlike CD which affects the entire bowel wall, UC is limited to the mucosa (epithelium), generally milder, with fewer resultant complications except for epithelial cancer, i.e., adenocarcinoma of the colon.</p><p>UC manifests itself by bloody diarrhea with or without mucus. The disease tends to be most severe in the rectum and sigmoid but can affect the entire colon. Because of this severity gradient sigmoidoscopy is a good gauge of mucosal disease activity. In contrast, CD can affect any part of the entire GI tract and frequently spares long segments of the colon or small bowel ("skip lesions"). Decisions about treatment of UC weigh such factors as disease activity, disease extent and duration, previous treatment attempts and patient's preference into account. The goal is to stop the patient's active acute disease (induction of remission) and then maintain the patient in remission. 5-ASA preparations, given orally, rectally or in combination, are the first line of treatment for induction of remission. Patients with mildto-moderate ulcerative colitis that is refractory to rectal therapies and to oral 5aminosalicylate are often advanced to oral glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents (azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine).</p><p>Patients who continue to require glucocorticoid therapy or those who do not respond to it are candidates for TNF-alpha-antagonists. Currently only infliximab (Remicade) is marketed for this indication.</p><p>Adalimumab is a humanized IgG monoclonal antibody that binds to TNFα and blocks its interaction with cell surface receptors, which in turn inhibits TNFα-induced proinflammatory effects.</p><p>Humira was originally approved for rheumatoid arthritis in 2002. Since then, it has also been found to be effective in treating several other diseases, and it is currently also approved for juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, and plaque psoriasis.</p><p>Humira has no specific contraindications. The approved labeling has a boxed warning for serious infections and malignancies, which is part of TNFα-antagonist class labeling.</p><p>The following serious adverse reactions are highlighted in the boxed warming for serious infections: tuberculosis, bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis), and infections due to other opportunistic pathogens. The following serious adverse reactions are highlighted in the boxed warming for malignancies: hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) and other lymphomas and malignancies. There are also warnings and precautions for hypersensitivity reactions, Hepatitis B virus reactivation, demyelinating disease, cytopenias, use with anakinra, heart failure, autoimmunity, use with live vaccines, and use with abatacept.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Exploratory Analyses in Detail Exploratory Analysis #1 (Applicant): Adjustment for Baseline Mayo Score</head><p>Exploratory Analysis #1 is summarized in the table below. This was submitted by the Applicant in the current review cycle in response to the Statistical Reviewer's analysis in the first review cycle (also described in the table below). The ITT-A3 and ITT-E populations of Study 826 were defined previously. *The ITT-non-A3 population is defined as the population prior to Amendment 3 that received Humira or placebo. # The IAS-E population (Induction and Maintenance Analysis Set) includes the ITT-E population of 826 and the ITT population of 827 <ref type="table">(Table above is</ref>  The Clinical Reviewer and Statistical Reviewer concluded that the results from the additional analysis populations (i.e., ITT-non-A3, ITT-E, and IAS-E) are post hoc and do not alleviate concerns of the pre-specified analyses.</p></div>

The Applicant provided the primary and secondary analyses of Study 826 using the ITT-E population (as opposed to the ITT-A3 population) and the IAS-E population.  The Clinical Reviewer concluded that the analysis of PM scores for Weeks 2 through 8 may suggest that patients respond early to treatment with Humira; however, this analysis does not reveal if patients who respond at Week 2 continue to be in response at Weeks 4 and 8 or if they subsequently lose that response prior to Week 8. Further, the Clinical Reviewer concluded that no statistical inferences can be made due to the exploratory nature of these analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory Analysis #6 (Applicant): Re-analysis from Study 827 Using Average of Last 3 days (Rather than Standard "Worst-Ranked" Methodology)</head><p>In the pre-specified Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), full Mayo (FM) scores were calculated using worst-rank methodology (i.e., the worst subscore from the past 3 days of the patient subject diary for Stool Frequency Score (SFS) and Rectal Bleeding Score (RBS) was used to calculate the Mayo score for each visit). To evaluate the possible impact of worst score versus average score methodology in Study 827, the Applicant undertook an exploratory analysis of selected patients from sites with readily-available diary data and re-calculated FM scores using the average SFS and RBS subscores from the three days prior to each visit.  The analysis was completed with data from only 16 of the 494 patients who participated in Study 827. The Clinical Reviewer concluded that with such a small sample size, no meaningful information can be obtained. In addition, the Clinical Reviewer concluded that these data cannot be relied upon for statistical inference given their post-hoc nature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory Analysis #7 (Applicant): All-Cause and UC-related Hospitalizations (Pooled Across Studies 826 and 827)</head><p>In a further exploratory analysis, the Applicant presented pooled data from Studies 826 and 827 to evaluate hospitalization rates with active drug and placebo. As previously pointed out, these two studies had significant design differences that make pooling of data for efficacy analysis highly problematic. led to the addition of the lower dose treatment arm. The hospitalizations of these patients were not used for the Applicant's hospitalization analysis because they "did not perform significantly better than subjects randomized to placebo for the primary endpoint." 2 Whether this is a valid reason is arguable: (1) This is a post-hoc justification; (2) a lower dose may not translate into an improvement in the Mayo score (primary endpoint), however, it may stabilize the patient enough to prevent a hospitalization.</p><p>While the Applicant presents data from several different sensitivity analyses which support their general conclusion (patients on active drug have fewer hospitalizations), other types of sensitivity analyses are not given: For example, results broken out by individual studies (826 and 827 not pooled) would be of interest and also an analysis that keeps patients on the low dose arm in Study 826 (pre-amendment) in the analysis.</p><p>The tables below are given for the purpose of reference.  The FDA Clinical Reviewer concluded that the analyses are post hoc and do not alleviate concerns regarding the results of the pre-specified analyses.</p><p>An Information Request was sent to the Applicant to address the additional concerns about pooling of data across studies and the selective exclusion/inclusion of portions of the ITT population. The Applicant responded to this request and provided analyses of hospitalization data for each study and treatment arm separately; this data is summarized in the following table.  The Clinical Reviewer noted that Partial Mayo scores among subjects who switched from EOW dosing to EW dosing decreased by 50% (from last EOW = 6.0 to last EW value = 3.0). However, the FDA Clinical Reviewer concluded that these data have limited informational value regarding added efficacy of a higher dose because there was no randomization to EOW or EW, the analysis was not pre-specified, and the underlying study was open-label.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Exploratory Analyses Overview</head><p>It is important to point out that the "integrated risk-benefit analysis" (using quantitative and exploratory analyses condensing complex data into one metric) the sponsor presents is very different from the benefit-risk assessment that supports FDA regulatory decisions. Our assessment is much broader than what is captured by these analyses and incorporates a wider range of factors, such as disease severity and patients' medical need, in addition to the extensive body of evidence on the drug's efficacy and safety. It also requires our scientific and clinical judgment about these factors and their importance. Because of this, as well as some specific limitations that will presented in section 7.2 this reviewer believes that that the Net Efficacy Analysis adjusted for Risk (NEAR) analysis and other combined metrics are not helpful as part of FDA's benefitrisk assessment for Humira. It should be noted that the discussion and presentation of Exploratory Analyses #9, #10, #11, and #12 shown below were provided by LaRee Tracy (Safety Statistics Team Leader) and Bradley McEvoy (Safety Statistics Reviewer) in preparation of the Advisory Committee Briefing Document. The safety statistics team was consulted after this reviewer had identified serious concerns with the combined safety-efficacy assessment the sponsor was proposing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Exploratory Analyses in Detail Exploratory Analysis #9 (Applicant): Serious Adverse Event (SAE)-Adjusted Days in Remission</head><p>The Applicant performed an exploratory analysis adjusting the days of clinical remission for days of serious adverse events (SAEs) leading to treatment discontinuation in Study 827. In this analysis, the mean days of SAEs leading to treatment discontinuation was subtracted from days of clinical remission. Despite the mean duration of SAEs being similar between the Humira 180/60 and placebo groups (4.11 and 4.64 days, respectively), the difference in SAE-adjusted days in clinical remission was statistically significantly different between groups. This difference is driven by the large difference in days of clinical remission (85.32 vs. 52.87 days in the Humira and placebo groups, respectively; p-value &lt; 0.001). Therefore, it is unclear what additional information the SAE-adjusted analysis of days of clinical remission provides beyond what can be inferred from the analysis that only considered days of clinical remission. Furthermore, the clinical meaningfulness of this analysis is unclear given the pooling of all SAE time without accounting for type of event and the timing of the event in relation to clinical remission, if remission occurred.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory Analysis #10 (Applicant): Number of Patients who Discontinued Due to Adverse Events Relative to Number of Patients in Remission at Weeks 8 and 52</head><p>The Applicant conducted an exploratory analysis of Study 827 comparing the proportion of patients who achieved clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52 between treatment groups relative to those that had any AE that led to treatment discontinuation. For the individual endpoints, the ADA group had more subjects in clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52 (21 vs. 10, ADA and placebo respectively; Fisher p-value = 0.062) and fewer patients who discontinued due to an AE (22 vs. 30, ADA and placebo respectively; Fisher p-value=0.244). From these frequencies, the Applicant estimates that for every placebo subject who achieved clinical remission at both week 8 and week 52, 3.0 placebo subjects discontinued due to AEs; for ADA, the ratio is 1.0. The clinical meaningfulness of the ratios is unclear. This approach lumps together all AEs that led to treatment discontinuation and therefore lacks in specificity of AE. This approach of lumping events can obscure imbalances between treatment groups for individual AEs.</p><p>The Applicant included a summary risk benefit measure, which is the ratio of the bytreatment risk to benefit ratios <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 14)</ref>. Specifically, the ratio of risk of discontinuing treatment due to AE to clinical remission in the placebo and ADA group is 30/10 (3.0) and 22/21 (1.0), respectively. The Applicant interprets this ratio as "placebo subjects are three times more likely to experience an AE leading to discontinuation than ADA subjects for the same level of clinical efficacy (measured by achieving clinical remission at Week 8 and Week 52)". The interpretation of this ratio of ratios is problematic for the following reasons: 1) the proportion of clinical efficacy differs between treatment groups, 2) this analysis does not fix the level of clinical efficacy in the estimation, and 3) this analysis assumes a one-to-one exchangeability for the efficacy and safety outcomes.</p><p>These same issues apply to the Applicant's risk benefit ratio obtained for subjects who discontinued treatment prematurely relative to the number of subjects in clinical remission at week 8 and clinical response at week 52 (results not presented). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory Analysis #11 (Applicant): Net Efficacy Adjusted Risk (NEAR) Analysis</head><p>The Applicant conducted an exploratory analysis combining clinical efficacy and safety into a single estimate. Their approach redefined the efficacy endpoint by only considering subjects with the efficacy response who also did not experience a particular safety event (i.e. a specific safety event-free treatment success). The odds of experiencing a safety event-free treatment success in the ADA group were then compared to the odds in the placebo group. The Applicant referred to this analysis as the Net Efficacy Adjusted for Risk (NEAR), which is discussed in a paper by Boada and colleagues 4,5 . The Applicant interprets a NEAR OR larger than one as a benefit-risk Beyond issues raised previously about lumping together various safety endpoints and performing a pooled analysis, the ability of this NEAR analysis to quantify benefit-risk in a clinically meaningful way is highly questionable. The limitations of this approach are threefold. First, this approach implicitly assumes that the clinical benefit of having a clinical response is of equal importance/weight as experiencing a specific safety event.</p><p>Such an assumption was not justified by the Applicant and is likely inappropriate due to the varying degree of safety events considered. The implication of this one-to-one exchange of efficacy for safety is illustrated by considering two hypothetical examples.</p><p>In the first example, suppose that one ADA randomized study patient died. Using the NEAR approach, the estimated NEAR OR would differ minimally from the estimated OR from an analysis of only efficacy ignoring the potential safety concerns. In the second example, consider the week 8 remission analysis (per FM) which has 180/468 responses in the placebo group and 241/471 in the ADA group. Suppose there were 61 SAEs all occurring in the ADA group and they all occurred in patients that had a clinical response. In this case, the number of SAE-free treatment successes in the ADA group is 180/471 compared to 180/468 for placebo. In this extreme scenario (which has an alarming safety signal), per this approach and the Applicant's interpretation, the NEAR OR would be below one suggesting ADA has an unfavorable benefit-risk ratio; however, if there were 60 (or fewer) SAEs (still a large signal), the ADA group would have a favorable benefit-risk ratio. These examples suggest incongruence between the proposed quantification of benefit-risk (based on an adapted version of the NEAR) to how clinical benefit is considered along with risk.</p><p>A second limitation is that the comparison only contrasts the favorable aspects of benefit-risk, i.e. the numerator value is based on patients with clinical benefit and who did not experience the specific safety event of interest. Other aspects of benefit-risk that can be obtained from the cross-classification of the efficacy response and safety event, such as the proportion of patients that did not have a clinical response (e.g. no <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The NEAR approach described in the publication is considered flawed. By obtaining expected counts from the marginal event counts, one is implicitly assuming that the efficacy and safety endpoints are independent. Such an assumption is incorrect and was not discussed in the source article. Further, as a consequence of their approach, if group A has a greater percentage of patients with a positive efficacy endpoint and fewer AEs compared to group B, with probability 1 the odds of treatment group A will be larger than the odds for group B (i.e., the OR&gt;1).</p><p>In addition, the Applicant's NEAR analysis differs from the approach described in the paper by <ref type="bibr">Boada et al (2008)</ref>. The difference is that the Applicant uses the observed number of subject that had an AE-free treatment success, whereas the source publication uses the expected numbers based on the marginal event counts within treatment groups.</p><p>Clinical Review Klaus Gottlieb sBLA 125057/232 Humira® (adalimumab) 28 remission) but did have an AE that led to treatment discontinuation, are not presented in the Applicant's NEAR analysis.</p><p>A third limitation is that the comparison only considers short-term efficacy with shortterm risk. The problem with this is that short-term efficacy assessment is not done without also considering long-term risk when one assesses the overall risk benefit of a product. The failure of the analysis to incorporate temporal considerations, in addition to the above points, is sufficient reason to question the results from this analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory Analysis #12 (Applicant): Number Needed to Harm (NNH) Analysis</head><p>The number needed to harm (NNH) corresponds to the number of patients needed to treat with Humira compared to placebo to result in one adverse event (SAE, AE leading to discontinuation, serious infections and malignancies). Estimates were derived by taking the inverse of the risk difference (1/difference of proportions) based on pooled data from the UC studies or from combined data from the UC and CD studies. Several point estimates were provided by the sponsor; however, it is unclear how clinically meaningful these values are without inclusion of confidence intervals, considering estimates when including data on all Humira exposures (not just on exposure to the Humira 160/80 treatment group) and understanding the type of events included (e.g. category of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation lacks in specificity of event).</p><p>The table below provides estimates of the NNH based on combined data from the two UC studies (826 and 827) using data collected up to 52 weeks. Two estimates are provided; one based on the inverse of the difference in proportion of events between placebo and the Humira 180/60 group and the second between placebo and all Humira. In addition, 95% CI (based on asymptotic method) are included to provide a measure of variability around the NNH estimates. The proportion of all SAEs in the placebo and Humira 160/80 groups are 10.1% and 8.3% respectively resulting NNH of -55 (1/(0.083-0.101)) with a 95% CI <ref type="bibr">(-18, 53)</ref>. This suggests a lower risk of SAE (when holding all other outcomes constant) in the Humira group.

We have described below our reasons for this action and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues. First, although both trials demonstrated statistically significant improvement for adalimumab treatment relative to placebo, we note that statistical significance is lost in Study M06-826 if the responder status of 1 patient in the adalimumab 160/80/40 group is changed from responder to non-responder, or if the responder status of 1 placebo-treated patient is changed from non-responder to responder. Although the clinical remission rate at Week 8 in the adalimumab 160/80/40 treatment group for Study M06-826 was statistically higher than that in the placebo group (18.5% vs. 9.2%, p=0.031), these results are sensitive to alternative analyses, and the conclusions are not considered robust from a statistical perspective. For example, adjusting the primary analysis for the significantly different baseline Mayo scores, the treatment differences were not significant (p=0.085). Moreover the significance of the analysis results is sensitive to the use of exact testing methods.</p></div>

The immunogenicity assay was not adequate because the original and new immunogenicity assays would not evaluate most patient samples appropriately due to the drug interference in the assays for anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) measurement. Therefore, there is a need to develop an assay with improved drug tolerance.</p><p>To address this issue, you should develop, qualify and implement an improved validated AAA assay with reduced sensitivity to product interference. Provide a detailed description of the methodology and plans for validation of the assays that will be used for the detection of AAA. The qualification results should include data demonstrating that the assay is specific, sensitive and reproducible, and should include information on the sensitivity of the assay to drug interference. The validated assay should be capable of sensitively detecting AAA responses in the presence of adalimumab levels that are expected to be present at the time of patient sampling. Until assays have been developed and validated, patient samples collected from clinical studies should be banked under appropriate storage conditions. 2. The immunogenicity profile for adalimumab has not been adequately assessed.</p><p>Utilizing a validated AAA assay as described in Item #1 above, you should assess the immunogenicity profile based on post-dose patient samples in which the adalimumab concentrations are not expected to interfere with the immunogenicity assay.  • Present new safety data from the studies for the proposed indication using the same format as the initial submission. • Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the initial data.</p><p>• Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the initial data with the retabulated frequencies described in the bullet above. • For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.</p><p>3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature study discontinuation by incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed studies. Describe any new trends or patterns identified.</p><p>4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each patient who died during a clinical study or who did not complete a study because of an adverse event. In addition, provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.</p><p>5. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the initial data.</p><p>6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical trials (e.g. number of subjects, person time).</p><p>7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this drug. Include an updated estimate of use for drug marketed in other countries.</p><p>8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously submitted.</p></div>

A verbatim transcript will be available and posted on the FDA website at: http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/GastrointestinalDr ugsAdvisoryCommittee/ucm291609.htm All external requests for the meeting transcripts should be submitted to the CDER, Freedom of Information Office. Questions to the Committee:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Dose Selection:</head><p>VOTE: Based on the exposure-response data and observed treatment effect presented, has the optimal Humira dose for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) been adequately established? Please comment on the need for further dose exploration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>YES: 3 NO: 14 ABSTAIN: 0</head><p>Those voting "Yes" commented that while the dose studied is clinically effective for anti-TNF naïve patients, an optimal dose has not been fully established. It was also noted that while the current dosing schedule was clinically effective in some patients, others required a higher dose of 40mg every week. The committee noted that the sponsor had requested for the product label to allow a higher dose in non responders. Such variable dosing is likely to minimize risk in responders, while allowing others to receive higher doses for clinical effectiveness. There were also comments that a post marketing dose ranging study was required.</p><p>Those who voted "No" noted that the optimal dosing for this drug has not been fully explored given FDA's concentration response analysis. Although the dosage used demonstrated clinical efficacy, the therapeutic effect continued to rise and did not plateau for the doses studied. It was commented that a higher dose study may have facilitated a better response; hence a post approval dose response study is needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Efficacy Analysis (Studies 826 and 827):</head><p>(a) DISCUSSION: Please discuss the factors that you consider in defining the term "clinically meaningful benefit" in patients with moderately to severely active UC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reference ID: 3196365</head><p>Clinical Review Klaus Gottlieb sBLA 125057/232 Humira® (adalimumab)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>45</head><p>Panel members expressed a range of opinions on this issue. Statistically significant clinical efficacy alone does not imply "clinically meaningful benefit". Such results require interpretation within the context of disease burden, safety, availability of other therapies and the therapeutic pipeline. Hence, a certain magnitude of difference between placebo and treatment groups assessed either by way of a delta or odds ratio or relative risk cannot alone determine "clinically meaningful benefit". Safety of Humira was of particular concern to some panel members; and in particular, the long term safety of the drug had not been fully evaluated. The impact of the disease on the quality of life and the need for alternative therapies were noteworthy concerns in other opinions. The steroid sparing effects or colectomy avoiding attributes of the drug were of significant importance. Patient age, duration of disease, length of therapy, and convenience of dosing were also mentioned as factors to consider. In summary, "clinically meaningful" is a subjective measure, and apart from risk benefit analysis, is dependent on patient (&amp;physician) preferences and their risk tolerance. Within the advisory committee there was variance in the comfort level with the risk-benefit trade off in the context of clinical effectiveness. While there was unanimity regarding the lack of long term safety record for this specific indication, given the track record of this drug for other medical conditions, most members were willing to accept the safety concerns, and endorse it despite its marginal effectiveness for UC.</p><p>(b) Clinical Remission at Week 8: VOTE: Do the observed treatment differences (Humira 160/80/40 versus placebo) in the proportion of patients that had clinical remission at Week 8 of 9.3% (95% CI: 0.8%, 17.9%) (Study 826) and 7.2% (95% CI: 1.3%, 13.2%) (Study 827) represent a clinically meaningful benefit? (please explain your vote)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>YES: 15 NO: 1 ABSTAIN: 1</head><p>Those voting "Yes" commented about unmet need, compliance &amp; convenience issues, which favored having adalimumab as a treatment option. The study did show statistical significance as compared to placebo, at week 8, albeit the differences being marginal. One member noted the long record of use of this drug and of the class of drugs. Several noted that currently given few treatment choices, adalimumab would be another option, especially for difficult to treat patients. Committee members hence endorsed Humira voting that it resulted in clinically meaningful benefit. Even the marginal benefit was acceptable given the high disease burden with regards to its impact on quality of life.</p><p>The member who voted "No" commented that although Week 8 results are statistically significant, it failed to meet the member's assessment of clinically meaningful because of inadequate information on durability of response and safety. It was also noted that the data suggest that it is best to use adalimumab as an alternative to Remicade as opposed to salvage therapy following Remicade. Data thus far suggests that benefits following Remicade are modest.</p><p>The member who voted "Abstain" commented that there wasn't enough information to provide a reliable answer and also commented that the answer could be "yes" if it could be determined that there weren't substantive safety issues, that the drug effect is durable, evidence was present to indicate adalimumab is effective in patients not adequately The members who voted "Yes" commented that Week 52 as a marker for durability of effect is a meaningful endpoint. It was also commented that remission is at the top of the list of what patients want to see.</p><p>The member who voted "No" commented that interpreting the question as related to the practicality of obtaining long-term data reliably, while desirable, is logistically challenging. To successfully conduct a trial of such a long duration given the likelihood of significant drop out rates and loss to follow up, without adversely impacting reliable and meaningful results is difficult.</p><p>(ii) VOTE: Does the observed treatment difference in the proportion of patients that had clinical remission at Week 52 of 8.8% (95% CI: 2.9%, 14.8%) (Study 827) represent a clinically meaningful benefit? (please explain your vote)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>YES: 15 NO: 1 ABSTAIN: 1</head><p>The members who voted "Yes" commented that the decision was made mainly on reasons discussed previously and due to durability of sustained response. One member noted that this is a more significant finding, showing consistency of continued exposure. Most members agreed that the result is clinically relevant at Week 52.</p><p>The member who voted "No" commented that the data does not represent clinically meaningful benefit and is not confident in the interpretation of the data at Week 52. It was also noted that the durability issue is not answered because it is a cross sectional look.</p><p>The member who voted "Abstain" noted that the decision was arrived for the same reasons as Question 2b. It was noted that the vote could be "Yes" if the agent was truly safe and if we knew the value of 8.8% was real and a vote could be "No" because we can't conclude there isn't a real risk for malignancy and serious infection. Members voting "Yes" commented that the magnitude of effect is disappointing, but does seem meaningful given the subset of patients who are difficult to treat. Some members expressed concerns regarding missing data for long term safety, but noted that benefits were seen.</p><p>The members who voted "No" commented that because of the unknown about safety and missing data, the answer could not be a Yes. It was also noted that the value of 4.4% for durability is very low for an agent that has the risks that are known.</p><p>One member voted "Abstain" for reasons that the magnitude of effect is disappointing but a rigorous endpoint and that the 4.4% is difficult to interpret when explaining the trial results to a patient.</p><p>3. Additional Pre-Approval Studies:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VOTE:</head><p>Are there additional efficacy studies that should be conducted prior to approving Humira for moderately to severely active UC? (please explain your vote)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>YES: 3 NO: 13 ABSTAIN: 1</head><p>Those who voted "Yes" commented that we need to further explore efficacy, safety, and dose. One member commented on the need for randomization trials involving patients with inadequate response or intolerance to existing therapy. Those who voted "No" commented that there are studies needed, but not for approval of the medication and the approval should not be held up for the proposed indication. Most of these members expressed the need for post approval dosing and safety trials.</p><p>One member abstained from voting due to unclear phrasing and noted the contingency of approval should not be dependent on efficacy studies, but the medication should be tailored to specific patient populations and more studies are necessary, especially looking at the safety profile.</p><p>One member who had originally voted "Yes," subsequently noted during the explanation of the vote that she wanted to vote "No" and did not feel there is a need for additional studies before approval, but does want to see post approval studies and sub population response to adalimumab. The vote count above records her vote as "Yes". Those who voted "Yes" commented that benefits outweigh the risks in various populations, given earlier discussions. The efficacy extended to patients intolerant to other anti-TNF therapies, anti-TNF naïve patients, those not responding to other conventional therapies, and populations with moderately to severely active disease. A few members noted that there is not enough data at this point to limit to certain populations.</p><p>Those who voted "No" commented that there are modest effects, but also uncertain durability and uncertain dose. One member also noted the lack of confidence in week 52 data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Post-Approval Studies:</head><p>DISCUSSION: If you believe this product should be approved for moderately to severely active UC, are there any additional studies you would recommend post-approval?</p><p>The panel commented on the need to explore higher doses and since baseline efficacy has already been established, there is a need to maximize efficacy. It was also noted that in addition to the need for exploration of drug dosage issues, the mechanism of action of the drug needs to be looked at more in depth.</p><p>The panel also wanted to see studies which will explore when to introduce a drug of this class, who is likely to benefit, and reasons for loss of response (i.e. immunogenicity or dose related). There were comments on the need for studies in young adults/teenage population especially in terms of safety and also gender specific responses.</p><p>The need for studies evaluating the correlation of serum trough levels with clinical effectiveness was noted. Also, it was pointed out that anti-adalimumab antibody measurements were not standardized and clinically available. The sponsor commented that they were committed to developing an improved immunogenicity assay and to have it made available shortly.</p><p>(Please see official transcript for details.)</p><p>The meeting adjourned at approximately 3:14 p.m.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Induction of remission at 8 weeks</head><p>Studies 826 and 827 each showed a treatment effect that was statistically significant by pre-specified analysis criteria. It is important to recognize that the primary results were replicated in both studies (similar induction rates were shown between studies among patients with no previous UC therapy). Independent substantiation of a treatment effect does not have to be shown in identically designed studies. However, an important shortcoming of study 826 was its failure to show statistical significance for the secondary endpoints.</p><p>The issues raised by the reviewer regarding alternative efficacy analyses of study 826 are much less of a concern than would be the case if there were only a single study involved. The reviewer correctly notes that study 826 was essentially underpowered. Because of the smaller sample size compared to study 827, the relatively small effect size, and the discrete nature of the data, the sensitivity of the p-value to a single patient's hypothetical change in classification status or to the use of an exact test of proportions is not an unexpected result nor one that should necessarily have been a significant review issue. Moreover, the assumptions underlying the sponsor's use of the Chi-square test statistic for study 826 are defensible, and the proper p-value for the primary comparison should be based on that analysis.</p><p>The reviewer's and sponsor's analyses adjusting for Mayo score at baseline are problematic since such analyses are driven by the observed data, and p-values are not strictly interpretable. The alternative methods to adjust the analyses presented by the sponsor seem reasonable, and there are many such methods that could have been applied. However, baseline imbalances are always possible in a randomized trial and given an appropriate randomization method, should not invalidate the pre-specified analysis results.</p><p>The sponsor's re-submission provided additional data and analyses of the 8 week induction endpoint for both studies and these results are consistent with the treatment effects observed in the primary analysis populations. Some of these supplemental analyses were in fact pre-specified prior to unblinding (see review, Section 3.1.1.1). Section 3.1.1.2 of the review discusses the sponsor's integrated analysis of subgroup effects which showed numerically greater proportions of remitters for adalimumab across each subgroup. These results are exploratory as the primary reviewer noted; however, the data trend in a direction favorable to treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sustained remission</head><p>The interpretation of the results from Study 827 at week 52 is a concern since many subjects terminated after week 8. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(See review, Section 3.1.1.3.</ref>) However it should be recognized that only about 20% of subjects in each group discontinued study enrollment during the double blind period, while an additional 55% (placebo) and 47% (adalimumab) moved to open-label treatment because they failed to maintain clinical response based on their partial Mayo scores. As pre-specified, all these subjects were considered treatment failures. A key assumption is clinical: Had these subjects remained in the study, they would not have been in remission at week 52.</p><p>The reviewer noted that non-responder imputation generally would bias results in favor of treatment when there are more drop-outs in the placebo arm. This may be true, but the bias is not measurable nor is it clear that it would be large enough to substantially alter the observed treatment effect. If the drug were effective, there would be more patients in the placebo group needing rescue due to lack of efficacy, which was the case.</p><p>The sponsor argued that those who were transferred to the open-label arm were, not responding to treatment according to pre-specified rules and that the non-responder imputation was appropriate. The sponsor conducted alternative analyses including a multiple imputation analysis for week 52 remission (also submitted in the original application) and a logistic regression analysis for weeks 8 and 52 responders showing results consistent with the protocol-specified analysis. However, the strengths of these analyses are debatable. Observed case and complete case sensitivity analyses were also done, and these showed a numerical trend in favor adalimimab.</p><p>If it is reasonable to assume that subjects who terminated early would not have been in remission at week 52, had they stayed on assigned treatment, then the results may well be indicative a 9% treatment effect for adalimumab with regard to remission at week 52. It seems natural to assume that those who moved to open-label treatment failed to stay in remission, but it is not the case that all those in remission at week 52 had been so since week 8. The trial was not designed however to measure remission at weeks other than 8 and 52. Partial Mayo scores were collected at other weeks and used by the sponsor to support remission status over time.</p><p>The proportions of subjects who responded at both weeks 8 and 52 are more difficult to interpret since the effect size for that outcome was small (4%) in addition to the missing value concerns. Statistically, the effect at week 52 appears more convincing while treatment difference for both 8 and 52 responders is statistically marginal, but both results reached statistical significance per pre-planned analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Team Leader Memorandum</head><p>3 Study 827 was not designed to demonstrate maintenance of remission, since subjects were not re-randomized after week 8; however the results at week 52 would seem to support a notion of durability or sustained remission under the condition that completers were in remission during the study, and that patients who terminated early were not in remission. The secondary endpoint of being in remission at both weeks 8 and 52 better supports the idea of a sustained remission but does not capture the time-course of remission throughout the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall conclusion</head><p>It seems clear that the studies met their primary statistical objectives for induction of clinical remission at week 8, and the sponsor's pre-specified statistical methods were applied appropriately. Study 827 demonstrated a statistically significant treatment effect for induction at 52 weeks and a small but significant effect for induction at both 8 and 52 weeks. However, statistical significance does not imply clinical significance, and whether or not the treatment differences observed in these studies are clinically meaningful was the key issue for the Advisory Committee.</p><p>The sponsor's complete response satisfactorily addressed many of the statistical issues raised in the CR letter. Although much of the resubmission was based on exploratory analyses, the results should be considered supportive. <ref type="figure">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</ref>--This is a representation of an electronic record that was signed electronically and this page is the manifestation of the electronic signature. <ref type="figure">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</ref></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Backgound</head><p>This review is a summary and critique of the methods considered by the sponsor in their benefitrisk analysis. This review does not follow the standard statistical review template or format.</p><p>Humira (adalimumab) is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Humira is FDA approved for treatment of adult patients with moderately and severely active rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis, and moderate to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Supplemental BLA 125057/232 was submitted by the sponsor on January 25, 2011for a new indication for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). On November 11, 2011 the Division of Gastroenterology and Inborn Errors Products (DGIEP) issued a complete response letter (CRL) stating the main approvability issues of concerns over selection of an appropriate dose and efficacy results that were sensitive to alternative analyses.</p><p>On July 17, 2012, DGIEP consulted the Division of Biometrics VII (DB7) to provide a statistical assessment of benefit-risk analyses provided by the sponsor in their March 30, 2012 formal response to the Agency's CRL and of the sponsor's briefing document for the August 28, 2012 Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee (GDAC) meeting. The quantitative benefit-risk analyses assessed by the statistical reviewer were the numbers need to treat (NNT) and the number needed to harm (NNH) analyses, a net-efficacy adjusted for risk (NEAR) analysis, and a serious adverse event (SAE) adjusted days in clinical remission analysis. This review summarizes the risk-benefit analyses provided by the sponsor along with comments on the statistical methods and limitations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NNT and NNH Analyses</head><p>The sponsor's GDAC briefing document included NNT and NNH analyses that attempt to characterize the benefit and risk of the Humira intervention in relation to the randomized placebo group. Note that this information was not included in the sponsor's formal response submission. For both NNT and NNH, estimates were derived by taking the inverse of the risk difference (1/difference of proportions for outcome of interest between randomized treatment groups) based on pooled data from the two comparative UC trials or combined data from the UC and Crohn's disease trials (NNH only). NNT estimates were presented for clinical remission, clinical response, mucosal healing, and inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) response. NNH estimates were presented for the incidence of any SAE, adverse events (AE) leading to study drug discontinuation, serious infection, and malignancy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Limitations of the NNT and NNH Analyses</head><p>The main issue is that the sponsor's conclusion from the NNT and NNH analysis is not supported by the data. Specifically, the sponsor concludes (on page 111 of the briefing document), "In almost all cases, the risk of harm was greater with placebo, as reflected by positive NNH values for the placebo group. … The data demonstrate that the benefits outweigh the risks for adalimumab in UC" and provides <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>. This conclusion can not be supported by the data since confidence intervals (CI) around the NNT and NNH estimates all include the null value (±∞). Therefore, it is not possible to conclude with statistical certainty that the risks of harm were greater in the placebo group than in the Humira group. The CIs are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 2</ref>, which was constructed by the statistical reviewer using the same data used by the sponsor to produce <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>. Other important shortcomings of the sponsor's analysis include pooling data from multiple trials and a lack of specificity when using composite safety endpoints. The issue of pooling data from multiple trials without properly adjusting, or accounting, for trial is it can yield confounded results since it does not preserve the within trial comparison established by randomization. The issue with considering a composite safety endpoint, where the component endpoints that define the composite may have differing levels of severity and timing of occurrence, is a loss of the specificity for the individual component endpoint.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NEAR Analyses</head><p>In an attempt to combine clinical efficacy and safety into a single composite estimate, the sponsor performed an analysis based on the NEAR approach described by Boada and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">2,</ref><ref type="bibr">3</ref> . The sponsor's NEAR analyses defined the composite benefit-risk endpoint as safety event-free treatment success, which included subjects with the efficacy response (e.g. clinical response) who also did not experience a particular safety event (e.g. serious infection).</p><p>Results from the NEAR analyses are presented in both the response to the CRL and GDAC briefing document. The values of the composite endpoint, which were used to calculate the NEAR odds ratio (OR), were tabulated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Treatment Group Responder w/o AE Non-responders w/o AE Responders with AE Non-responders with AE Humira A1 B1 C1 D1 Placebo A2 B2 C2 D2</formula><p>The odds (responders without an AE/all other subjects in the same treatment group) of experiencing a safety event-free treatment success in the Humira 160/80 mg group were then compared to the odds in the placebo group with 95% confidence intervals calculated using standard methods. The NEAR OR was calculated as follows: (A1/(B1+C1+D1))/ (A2/(B2+C2+D2)). The sponsor interpreted a NEAR OR larger than one as a benefit-risk ratio in favor of Humira compared to placebo.</p><p>In the sponsor's GDAC briefing document, NEAR analyses were presented through week 8 using pooled data from trials 826 and 827 (Integrated analysis-set extended (IAS-E)), and through week 52 using the ITT analysis set from trial 827. At each time-point (week 8 or week 52), NEAR ORs were calculated for the efficacy endpoints of clinical response and clinical remission, and the safety events consisting of serious infection and any SAEs (which included serious infections). Results from the analyses are presented below. The estimated OR are all 2 Boada JN, Boada C, Garcia-Saiz M, et al. Net Efficacy Adjusted for Risk (NEAR): a simple procedure for measuring risk:benefit balance. PLoS One. 2008;3(10):e3570. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The NEAR analysis performed by the sponsor differs from the approach described in the source publication. The NEAR methodology, as described in the publication, compares between treatment groups, the expected number of subjects that had a treatment success without experiencing a specific safety event. That is, rather than compare the observed or actual numbers of subjects that had a treatment success and not a safety event, the comparison is based on the expected count. The expected numbers are obtained by a questionable assumption that the efficacy and safety endpoint are independent. Use of the expected numbers is motivated by only having access to marginal events counts (e.g., published literature). Since the sponsor had patient-level data, the comparisons were based the observed number count rather than the expected under assumptions of independence.</p><p>sBLA 125072/232: Humira (adalimumab) Statistical Safety Review of the Benefit-Risk Analyses 5 larger than 1 and the CIs all exclude 1, suggesting a statistically greater number of subjects in the Humira group that had a safety event-free treatment success compared to placebo. While these findings are favorable for Humira, they should be interpreted cautiously for reasons described in the following section "Statistical Limitations with Sponsor's NEAR Analyses". </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Limitations with Sponsor's NEAR Analyses</head><p>Beyond issues previously raised regarding lumping or combining various safety endpoints into a single composite endpoint and pooling data from multiple trials without assigning weights, the ability of the sponsor's NEAR analysis to quantify benefit-risk in a clinically-meaningful way has the following limitations.</p><p>First, this approach implicitly assumes that the clinical benefit of having a clinical response is of equal importance or weight as experiencing a specific safety event. Such an assumption was not justified by the sponsor in any of the benefit-risk scenarios. Furthermore, it is potentially inappropriate to assume equal weights due to the varying degree of importance of both the safety and efficacy events. For example, a serious infection may be more or less important clinically than the occurrence of clinical response. The implication of this one-to-one exchange of efficacy for safety is illustrated by considering a hypothetical example. Consider the week 8 remission analysis for which 180/468 (38.5%) remissions were reported in the placebo group and 240/470 (51.1%) in the Humira group. Suppose there were 59 SAEs in the Humira group occurring in subjects that had a clinical response, and none in the placebo group. In this extreme hypothetical scenario showing an alarming safety signal disfavoring the Humira group, the NEAR OR is greater than 1, suggesting Humira has a favorable benefit-risk ratio. This example illustrates an obvious incongruence between the proposed quantification of benefit-risk to how clinical benefit is considered along with risk.</p><p>A second limitation of the sponsor's use of the NEAR method is that the comparisons only contrast the favorable aspects of benefit-risk, i.e. the numerator value is based on patients with</p><p>Reference ID: 3200696 sBLA 125072/232: Humira (adalimumab) Statistical Safety Review of the Benefit-Risk Analyses 6 clinical benefit who also did not experience the specific safety event of interest. Other important aspects of benefit-risk assessment, such as patients that did not have a clinical response (e.g. no remission) but did have a safety event, are not incorporated into the benefit-risk calculus.</p><p>A third limitation of the sponsor's use of the NEAR method is that the assessment of week 8 clinical outcome does not control for long-term safety. For example, the analyses used a week 8 assessment for efficacy but safety was not measured out to week 52. That is, assessing shortterm efficacy with short-term safety provides an incomplete assessment of benefit-risk since shortterm efficacy is balanced with both considerations for short-term safety and long-term safety. The failure of the analyses to account for timing of the event, in addition to the preceding two limitations, is sufficient reason to question the results from these analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SAE-Adjusted Days in Remission</head><p>In the formal response to the CRL, the sponsor presented an exploratory analysis adjusting the days of clinical remission for days of serious adverse events (SAEs) leading to treatment discontinuation in trial 827; it is unclear from the report why this analysis was not performed using data from trial 826. Note that this information was not included in the sponsor's GDAC background document. In this analysis, the mean days of SAEs leading to treatment discontinuation was subtracted from days of clinical remission.</p><p>Despite the mean duration of SAEs being similar between the Humira 160/80 and placebo groups (4.11 and 4.64 days, respectively), the difference in SAE-adjusted days in clinical remission was statistically significantly different between groups. This difference is driven by the large difference in days of clinical remission (85.32 vs. 52.87 days in the Humira and placebo groups, respectively; p-value &lt; 0.001). Therefore, it is unclear what additional information the SAE-adjusted analysis of days of clinical remission provides beyond what can be inferred from the analysis that only considered days of clinical remission. Furthermore, the clinical meaningfulness of this analysis is unclear given the pooling of all SAE time without accounting for type or severity of the event and the timing of the event in relation to clinical remission, if remission occurred.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Three quantitative benefit-risk analyses presented by the sponsor were found to have several important methodological limitations. These include an inability to account for unequal clinical relevance of safety and efficacy component endpoints in the composite measures, pooling events with differing severity or importance, failure to account for other benefit-risk scenarios, and failure to account for time-varying events. While these approaches attempt to present benefit-risk as a summary measure, they suffer from a loss of specificity and interpretability as used in this application. Therefore, these analyses and the sponsor's interpretation of the results from the analyses serve little, if any, useful function in the overall benefit-risk assessment for the use of Humira in patients with moderate to severe UC.</p><p>- <ref type="figure">------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</ref>--This is a representation of an electronic record that was signed electronically and this page is the manifestation of the electronic signature.</p><p>- <ref type="figure">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</ref>  </p><formula xml:id="formula_15">---- /s/ ---------------------------------------------------</formula></div>

A main reason for the sensitivity of results for Study M06-826 was its smaller sample size. Both studies showed a small but similar treatment effect for induction.

For example, adjusting the primary analysis for the significantly different baseline Mayo scores, the treatment differences were not significant (p=0.089). Moreover the significance of the analysis results is sensitive to the use of exact testing methods as well as the classification status based on a single subject.</p><p>Statistical results from analysis of secondary endpoints (including clinical response) failed to show evidence of treatment benefit of adalimumab 160/80/40 over placebo.

With regard to alternative statistical analyses, the primary endpoint from Study M06-826 (ITT-A3) was reanalyzed using Fisher's exact test and statistical significance remained (p = 0.047).</p><p>When adjusting the primary analysis for the Baseline Mayo scores, the sponsor was able to replicate the FDA's post-hoc covariate analysis with Baseline Mayo score as a stratification factor. However, this Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH)-based analysis included low subject counts for the Baseline Mayo scores of 6, 11, and 12.</p><p>The sponsor performed three alternative analyses based on the CMH test, using Baseline Mayo score as a stratification factor by categorizing Baseline Mayo score by median, tertiles, and quartiles, where Baseline Mayo scores with low subject counts were combined. All 3 analyses using the ITT-A3 subjects resulted in p values &lt; 0.05 for treatment differences (See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Appendix  Tables 1-3)</ref>. In addition, within Study M06-826, the estimated treatment difference between adalimumab and placebo was consistent when using the ITT-E Analysis Set and the ITT-non A3 Analysis Set.</p></div>

The choice of anti-TNF use as a pre-specified stratification factor was based on an expected difference in clinical response due to prior anti-TNF use.</p><p>To address the statistical robustness in Study M06-827, the first ranked secondary endpoint of sustained clinical remission at Weeks 8 and 52 was analyzed by the sponsor using the alternative methodology of logistic regression with treatment group as the factor. Based on this analysis, the statistical significance remained (P = 0.048).</p><p>Regarding the second part of the FDA's comment referring to early drop-outs, the design of Study M06-827 permitted subjects who had an inadequate clinical response to DB treatment to move to OL adalimumab starting at Week 12 of the study rather than discontinuing from the study outright. These rules for escape were as follows:</p><p>• Partial Mayo (PM) score ≥ Baseline score on 2 consecutive visits at least 14 days apart (for subjects with a PM score of 4 to 7 at Baseline). • PM score ≥ 7 on 2 consecutive visits at least 14 days apart (for subjects with a PM score of 8 or 9 at Baseline).</p><p>The above criteria allowed escape for all subjects, even for subjects who were showing some improvement. These allowances were necessary to allow for adequate upfront study enrollment and were required to satisfy the needs of ethics committees, subjects, and investigator physicians.</p><p>Summary of number and percentage of subjects who discontinued the study during the DB period or Moved to OL Adalimumab for Study M060-827 is given below.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.1">Background</head><p>The incidence in North America is estimated at 2.2 to 14.3 cases per 100,000 person-years with a prevalence of 37 to 246 cases per 100,000 persons.1 The burden of UC on the health care system is profound, accounting for nearly 500,000 physician visits and more than 47,000 hospitalizations per year in the United States (US) alone. The cost of ulcerative colitis (UC) in the United States in 2008 was estimated to be $8.1 to $14.9 billion, of which a significant portion is direct medical costs related to hospitalizations and surgeries.</p><p>The objectives of this integrated analysis were to assess the effect of adalimumab maintenance therapy on the risk of all-cause hospitalization, UC-related hospitalization, UC-or drug-related hospitalization, and colectomy in the pooled Study M06-826 and Study M06-827 trials. Hospitalization is an important outcome for patients with any disease. A patient in hospital is a patient with impaired work productivity and poor quality of life. It can be considered a hard endpoint for assessing benefits of a therapy. Reduction of hospitalization would reflect a therapy's tangible benefits to patients, which is relevant to patients, physicians, and society. In addition, hospitalization, especially all-cause hospitalization can be viewed as composite indicator for benefit-risk profile of a therapy since it includes hospitalization due to adverse events of the therapy, collected prospectively, and every hospitalization is considered a serious adverse event in clinical trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.2">Sponsor's Results</head><p>In the analysis, there are two comparison groups: pooled placebo from Study M06-826 and Study M06-827, pooled adalimumab from Study M06-826 and Study M06-827. For Study M06-826, the adalimumab 160/80 mg and placebo treatment groups of the ITT-E population were included. For Study M06-827, all patients in the ITT population were included.</p><p>As described in <ref type="figure">Figure below</ref>, patients could have different follow-up periods:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hospitalization Events Follow-up</head><p>• For adalimumab-treated patients in both studies, the follow-up period comprised the DB period plus the OL period if the patient entered the OL period (including adalimumab 40 mg eow and ew therapy).</p><p>○ For patients who withdrew from the study, the follow-up period was 70 days after the last dosing date. (e.g., the second line in <ref type="figure">Figure)</ref>. The 70-day duration for the follow-up period was chosen because it represents 5 times the half-life of adalimumab. In addition, 70 days after the last dose of adalimumab is the standard follow-up time in the adalimumab ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease clinical program. ○ For those who completed the trials and did not enter Study M10-223, the follow-up period was 70 days after the last dosing date of Study M06-826 and Study M06-827 (e.g., the first line in <ref type="figure">Figure)</ref>.</p><p>• For placebo-treated patients, the follow-up period was generally the DB period plus the 70-day follow-up (e.g., the fourth line in <ref type="figure">Figure)</ref> or the last study day of Study M06-826 and Study M06-827 if they rolled over into the extension trial (Study M10-223).</p><p>○ If a patient withdrew from the study during the DB period, the follow-up was 70 days after the last dosing date (e.g., the fourth and sixth lines in <ref type="figure">Figure)</ref>.</p><p>○ For placebo-treated patients who switched to OL adalimumab the follow-up period depended on whether they enrolled into the follow-on Study M10-223 trial. For those placebo-treated patients who did not enroll in Study M10-223, the follow-up period was 70 days after the date they switched to OL treatment (e.g., the fifth line in <ref type="figure">Figure)</ref>. For placebo-treated patients who did enroll in Study M10-223, the end of the follow-up period was the earlier date of either 70 days after switching to OL adalimumab or the last study date in Study M06-826 or Study M06-827 prior to enrollment in Study M10-223.</p><p>For patients who switched from placebo to OL adalimumab, hospitalizations/colectomies that occurred during the first 70 days of OL adalimumab were attributed to placebo to capture the potential for delayed hospitalization/colectomy resulting from the failure of placebo therapy in the DB period.</p><p>The outcomes examined in this analysis were all-cause hospitalizations, UC-related hospitalizations, UC-or drug-related hospitalizations, and colectomy.</p><p>Events of hospitalization and colectomy were identified by a review of serious adverse events (SAEs) or AEs leading to discontinuation narratives from the study reports and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) expedited reports.</p><p>Two external gastroenterologists who were blinded to the treatment assignment performed the review. Any disagreement at the initial assessment between two reviewers was resolved through further review by the same reviewers. Hospitalization was categorized into the following groups:</p><p>• All-cause hospitalizations: Defined as SAEs resulting in admission to the hospital for any reason.</p><p>• UC-related hospitalizations: Defined as hospital admissions due to adverse events (AEs) or complications that were related to UC and included the following categories: UC-related surgery; hospitalizations for nonsurgical UC-related events, such as UC-related flares; and hospitalizations related to the complications/extraintestinal manifestations of UC.</p><p>• Drug-related hospitalizations: Defined as hospital admissions due to potential adverse events related to medications used to treat UC (e.g., anti-TNF, steroids and/or immunomodulators). The identification of drug-related hospitalization was based on the judgment of the external gastroenterologists.</p><p>Analyses were performed for the following population data sets:</p><p>• Partial Mayo score response is defined as a decrease from Baseline in partial Mayo score ≥ 2 points AND a decrease from Baseline in partial Mayo score ≥ 30% and decrease in the rectal bleeding score (RBS) ≥ 1 or an absolute RBS of 0 or 1.</p><p>The total patient population comprised 939 patients with 471 and 468 patients in the adalimumab 160/80 mg and placebo treatment arms, respectively. The W8 ADA responders based on full Mayo score comprised 241 patients. If partial Mayo score was used, the W8 ADA responder population comprised 242.</p><p>Note that the P value for comparisons of adalimumab Week 8 responders versus nonresponders should be considered non-inferential. The corresponding nonresponder data is also provided as a reference.</p><p>Incidence rates for hospitalizations (all-cause, UC-related, and UC-or drug-related) and colectomy were calculated as the number of patients with the respective event divided by the time at risk. For patients with an event during the study period, time at risk was the patient-years (PYs) from baseline to the first event. For patients without an event during the study period, time at risk was PYs from baseline to the end of study follow-up period.</p><p>The event date was defined as the date of admission to the hospital for hospitalization and the admission date of colectomy or the earliest of the surgery referral date for a subsequent colectomy. Relative risk ratios and confidence intervals were calculated to evaluate the statistical significance of the difference between the 2 arms.</p><p>The numbers of all-cause and UC-related hospitalizations as well as the combined incidence rates for UC-related hospitalization were also lower in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group (5% versus 22%, respectively). Similar results were obtained if the W8 ADA responder population was based on partial Mayo score.</p><p>The number of hospitalizations by treatment arm is presented in <ref type="table">Table below</ref>.

The contents of this resubmission do not change the conclusions of the original review. The Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee was convened on Aug 28, 2012.</p><p>The following is one of the questions asked to the committee:</p><p>"Based on the exposure-response data and observed treatment effect presented, has the optimal Humira dose for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) been adequately established? Please comment on the need for further dose exploration. "</p><p>The Committee voted <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">14 (No)</ref> to 3 (Yes) concluding that the optimal dose has not been established. Those who voted "No" noted that a higher dose may present a better picture of benefit and risk and that a post-approval dose response is recommended.</p><p>POST-MARKERTING COMMITMENTS 1. A trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of an induction regimen at doses higher than 160/80 mg is recommended as a post-marketing commitment. This recommendation is based on the exposure-response analysis conducted by the agency. This analysis indicates that an induction regimen with doses higher than 160/80 mg may provide additional benefit for inducing clinical remission. The protocol should be agreed upon by the agency prior to the initiation of the trial.</p><p>2. The immunogenicity assay as not adequate because the original and new imunogencity assays would not evaluate most patient samples appropriately due to the drug interference in the assays for anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) measurement. There fore, there is a need to develop an assay with improved rug tolerance.</p><p>To address this issue, you should develop, qualify and implement and improved validated AAA assay with reduced sensitivity to product interference. Provide a detailed description of the methodology and plans for validation of the assays that will be used for the detection of AAA. The qualification results should include data demonstrating that the assay is specific, sensitive and reproducible, and should include information on the sensitivity of the assay to drug interference. The validated assay should be capable of sensitively detecting AAA responses in the presence of adalimumab levels that are expected to be present at the time of patient sampling, Until assays have been developed and validated, patient samples collected from clinic studies should be banked under appropriate storage conditions.</p><p>3. The immunogenicity profile for adalimimab has not been adequately assessed. Utilizing a validated AAA assay as described in Item #2 above, you should assess the immunogenicity profile based on post-dose patient samples in which the adalimumab concentrations are not expected to interfere with the immunogenicity assay."</p><p>subjects. For clinical response, the relationship with concentration was not statistically significant.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety</head><p>The relationship between adalimumab exposure and incidence of infection was also examined. AUC from weeks 0 to 4 was used as the exposure metric because this is when expsoure is the highest. First incidence of infection over the entire study period was chosen as the safety response.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">BACKGROUND</head><p>On January 25, 2011, the Applicant submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application for the addition of a new indication for Humira (adalimumab) for reducing the signs and symptoms, and achieving clinical remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. This supplement received a Complete Response on November 21, 2011. On March 30, 2012, the Applicant resubmitted this supplemental BLA Application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">REGULATORY HISTORY</head><p>Humira was approved in December 2002 to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and Crohn's disease. In 2008, two additional indications, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and plaque psoriasis, were approved.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">SELECTION OF MEDICATION ERROR CASES</head><p>An AERS search was not conducted for this supplement because we have been actively monitoring medication errors with this product. There have been reports of incomplete injection and accidental firing associated with the Humira Pen. The issues have been discussed in OSE Reviews #2012-578, #2001-2102 and #2009-935. This supplement involves the addition of a new indication and does not directly involve the issues discussed above. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">DISCUSSION</head><p>The Applicant is proposing a new indication, Ulcerative Colitis to be added to the insert labeling and the Medication Guide. The dosage and administration for the proposed Ulcerative Colitis indication is the same as the currently approved Crohn's Disease indication with the exception that Humira should only be continued in patients who have responded to Humira during the first 8 weeks of therapy. For patients who respond and then lose their response, consideration may be given to increasing the dosing frequency of Humira to 40 mg every week from the maintenance dosing frequency of 40 mg every other week.</p><p>Additionally, the insert labeling states that the starting dose for the proposed Ulcerative Colitis indication will be supplied the same as the Crohn's Disease Starter Package. The carton labeling is also the same as the currently approved Crohn's Disease Starter Package with the addition of a change to the heading to "Crohn's Disease/Ulcerative Colitis Starter Package". This is acceptable because the initiation doses for both indications are the same.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</head><p>DMEPA concludes that the proposed insert and carton labeling and the Medication Guide are acceptable and we have no recommendations to be implemented prior to approval of this BLA supplement.</p><p>If you have further questions or need clarifications, please contact Nitin Patel, project manager, at 301-796-5412.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDICES APPENDIX A. DATABASE DESCRIPTIONS Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS)</head><p>The Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) is a computerized information database designed to support the FDA's post-marketing safety surveillance program for drug and therapeutic biologic products. The FDA uses AERS to monitor adverse events and medication errors that might occur with these marketed products. The structure of AERS complies with the international safety reporting guidance (ICH E2B) issued by the International Conference on Harmonisation. Adverse events in AERS are coded to terms in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities terminology (MedDRA).</p><p>AERS data do have limitations. First, there is no certainty that the reported event was actually due to the product. FDA does not require that a causal relationship between a product and event be proven, and reports do not always contain enough detail to properly evaluate an event. Further, FDA does not receive all adverse event reports that occur with a product. Many factors can influence whether or not an event will be reported, such as the time a product has been marketed and publicity about an event. Therefore, AERS cannot be used to calculate the incidence of an adverse event in the U.S. population. </p></div>

In this trial, the efficacy of Humira (adalimumab) should also be assessed, both during induction treatment as well as during continued treatment after induction, and pharmacokinetic measurements should be conducted for exposureresponse analysis. In this trial, collecting samples for immunogenicity testing (utilizing a validated anti-adalimumab antibody assay as described in PMR #3 above) and conducting analyses of the impact of immunogenicity on safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy is important. The protocol should be agreed upon by the agency prior to the initiation of the trial. This was not a pre-approval requirement because the primary endpoint for induction of clinical remission was met in two separate double blind randomized placebo controlled clinical trials. However, a modest treatment effect for induction of clinical remission (&lt; 10%) was observed. Furthermore, the clinical remission rate increased with increasing adalimumab exposures without reaching a plateau in the pivotal trial. This raised a concern that the optimal dose of adalimumab for ulcerative colitis may not have been selected and that a higher dose may provide additional benefit.</p><p>Therefore, a post-approval study to compare efficacy and safety of a 160/80 mg induction dosing regimen with higher induction dosing regimens will be valuable in the identification of the optimal dose for ulcerative colitis patients.</p></div>

(c) Both Weeks 8 and 52: Yes=10 votes; No=6 votes; Abstain=1 vote. In addition, the Committee was asked if the endpoint of clinical remission at Week 52 represents a clinically meaningful endpoint; the votes were as follows: Yes=16 votes; No=1 vote (see also Sections 2.4 and 9). The clinical reviewer noted that his evaluation of the risk-benefit assessment for Humira was favorable based on the input of the GIDAC. This reviewer agrees with the recommendations of the GIDAC and the clinical reviewer that the analysis of the primary endpoints of each of the studies and the first-ranked secondary endpoint of Study 827 (sustained clinical remission) demonstrate a clinically meaningful benefit. This reviewer notes in particular that the Study 827 Week 8 clinical remission result replicates the Study 826 Week 8 clinical remission result; thus, efficacy for induction of clinical remission is demonstrated even if one concludes that the Study 826 Week 8 clinical remission result is not robust.</figDesc></figure>

For both this endpoint and the Week 52 co-primary endpoint, there were large numbers of early drop-outs, 78% placebo vs. 69% adalimumab. These high rates undermine reliance on the estimated treatment effect, and the higher placebo rate would tend to produce bias in favor of the study drug. b. A subgroup analysis based on use of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine at baseline (yes vs. no) showed inconsistent treatment difference in clinical remission at Week 8 between adalimumab and placebo; -2.1 % vs. 12.1 %.c.

The observed data from Study 827 indicate that the maximum clinical remission rate is not reached within the observed range of exposures. The Emax structure, however, forces the model to predict a plateau for response (induction of clinical remission).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OND Division:</head><p>OND/ODE3/DGIEP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY HUMIRA ® (adalimumab) is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for human tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Adalimumab is approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic, arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease (CD), and plaque psoriasis. The Applicant submitted a supplemental biologic license application on January 25, 2011 to seek approval of adalimumab for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. The application received a complete response November 21, 2011. One of the concerns was that the appropriate adalimumab dose may not have been adequately selected.</p><p>Exposure-response analysis conducted with data from study M06-827 suggested a higher induction dose could achieve a greater treatment effect for the induction of clinical remission. The review further concluded that the dosing regimen for ulcerative colitis has not been fully explored and without a better defined dosing paradigm the clinical efficacy of Humira in ulcerative colitis population can not be considered adequately defined. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is a representation of an electronic record that was signed electronically and this page is the manifestation of the electronic signature.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix to Action Package Checklist</head><p>An NDA or NDA supplemental application is likely to be a 505(b)(2) application if:</p><p>(1) It relies on published literature to meet any of the approval requirements, and the applicant does not have a written right of reference to the underlying data. If published literature is cited in the NDA but is not necessary for approval, the inclusion of such literature will not, in itself, make the application a 505(b)(2) application. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(2)</ref> Or it relies for approval on the Agency's previous findings of safety and efficacy for a listed drug product and the applicant does not own or have right to reference the data supporting that approval. (3) Or it relies on what is "generally known" or "scientifically accepted" about a class of products to support the safety or effectiveness of the particular drug for which the applicant is seeking approval. (Note, however, that this does not mean any reference to general information or knowledge (e.g., about disease etiology, support for particular endpoints, methods of analysis) causes the application to be a 505(b)(2) application.)</p><p>Types of products for which 505(b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(2)</ref> applications are likely to be submitted include: fixed-dose combination drug products (e.g., heart drug and diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) combinations); OTC monograph deviations(see 21 CFR 330.11); new dosage forms; new indications; and, new salts.</p><p>An efficacy supplement can be either a (b)(1) or a (b)(2) regardless of whether the original NDA was a (b)(1) or a (b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(2)</ref>.</p><p>An efficacy supplement is a 505(b)(1) supplement if the supplement contains all of the information needed to support the approval of the change proposed in the supplement. For example, if the supplemental application is for a new indication, the supplement is a 505(b)(1) if:</p><p>(1) The applicant has conducted its own studies to support the new indication (or otherwise owns or has right of reference to the data/studies). (2) And no additional information beyond what is included in the supplement or was embodied in the finding of safety and effectiveness for the original application or previously approved supplements is needed to support the change. For example, this would likely be the case with respect to safety considerations if the dose(s) was/were the same as (or lower than) the original application.</p><p>(3) And all other "criteria" are met (e.g., the applicant owns or has right of reference to the data relied upon for approval of the supplement, the application does not rely for approval on published literature based on data to which the applicant does not have a right of reference).</p><p>An efficacy supplement is a 505(b)(2) supplement if:</p><p>(1) Approval of the change proposed in the supplemental application would require data beyond that needed to support our previous finding of safety and efficacy in the approval of the original application (or earlier supplement), and the applicant has not conducted all of its own studies for approval of the change, or obtained a right to reference studies it does not own. For example, if the change were for a new indication AND a higher dose, we would likely require clinical efficacy data and preclinical safety data to approve the higher dose. If the applicant provided the effectiveness data, but had to rely on a different listed drug, or a new aspect of a previously cited listed drug, to support the safety of the new dose, the supplement would be a 505(b)(2). (2) Or the applicant relies for approval of the supplement on published literature that is based on data that the applicant does not own or have a right to reference. If published literature is cited in the supplement but is not necessary for approval, the inclusion of such literature will not, in itself, make the supplement a 505(b)(2) supplement.</p><p>(3) Or the applicant is relying upon any data they do not own or to which they do not have right of reference.</p><p>If you have questions about whether an application is a 505(b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(1)</ref>  Cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants including TNF-alpha-blockers for Inflammatory Bowel Disease. The disease is rare. Described cases have all been fatal. It is conceivable that polymorphism in genes involved in immunoregulatory functions predispose to this SAE. Whole genome sequencing or other suitable genomics studies conducted on patients who have been afflicted by HSTCL could identify those patients who are at risk for this SAE. However, given the rarity of HSTCL, enough high quality samples need to first be prospectively identified to be able to have enough power to detect relevant polymorphisms, if they indeed exist. This requires a study to bank samples for future evaluation to identify genetic mutations and other biomarkers that predispose inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients to developing Hepatosplenic T-Cell Lymphoma (HSTCL). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PMR #2</head><p>A multi-center observational study of Humira (adalimumab) in adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis treated in a routine clinical setting, to assess the long-term safety as measured by the incidence of opportunistic infections and malignancies. Long-term effectiveness should be assessed as a secondary goal. The proposed study should follow patients for a period of at least 10 years from time of enrollment in order to ascertain adverse events with longer latency periods such as malignancies. The primary analysis is to summarize safety data for patients on adalimumab and patients on non-biologic immunomodulator therapy. The study should be adequately sized to sufficiently detect a doubling of the risk of lymphoma events in each treatment group. A secondary analysis is to summarize safety data for patients on adalimumab and patients on the combination of adalimumab and nonbiologic immunomodulator therapy. In addition, the study is to document and evaluate effects of withdrawal and re-treatment with adalimumab and "switching" with other tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-blockers or biologics. The incidence of the serious adverse event of interest, especially of certain malignancies, is low and data need to be accumulated over a10 year period. This PMR/PMC has been reviewed for clarity and consistency, and is necessary to further refine the safety, efficacy, or optimal use of a drug, or to ensure consistency and reliability of drug quality.</p></div>

These will also be sent under a separate communication. We are reviewing the clinical pharmacology sections of your supplemental BLA and have the following comments and questions:</p><p>1. We note that in the exposure-response plots displayed in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> and <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> of your resubmission <ref type="bibr">(dated March 30, 2012)</ref>, it appears that the total number of subjects with measured adalimumab concentrations at Week 8 is 239. In the PK dataset submitted in the original submission (pk-dataset.xpt), there are only 220 subjects with measured adalimumab concentrations at Week 8. Of these 220 subjects, concentrations for 7 subjects were below the limit of quantitation. Provide an explanation for the apparent discrepancy between the numbers.</p><p>2. In your Advisory Committee Briefing Document, you have presented new exposureresponse analyses using an Emax logistic regression model. This analysis was not submitted to the Agency previously and was therefore could not be reviewed. In the new analysis, you conclude that "efficacy approaches a plateau at the upper concentration quartiles of the studied adalimumab dose." First, we find this to be a circular argument because you are apparently fixing the Emax parameter in your model based on data from Study M06-827. Second, this statement appears to be in contrast with your statement on page 105 of the resubmission that "an increase in induction dose may increase the overall efficacy at Week 8." Therefore, we believe that the Emax model may not be appropriate for describing the exposure-response data for the induction phase. Based on the analysis conducted by the FDA, an increase in adalimumab concentration is associated with an increase in clinical remission rate at Week 8. Furthermore, this relationship does not reach a plateau over the range of concentrations observed at the proposed induction dose which suggest a higher induction dose may provide a higher remission rate.</p><p>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.</p></div>
