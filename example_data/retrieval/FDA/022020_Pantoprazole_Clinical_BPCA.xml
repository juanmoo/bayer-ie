I also recommend approval of Protonix Delayed-Release Tablets for the short-term treatment of EE associated with GERD for pediatric patients age 5 years through 16 years. Efficacy of Protonix is extrapolated from the adult indication as the pathophysiology of EE associated with GERD is believed to be the same in adults and pediatric patients older than one year. There are sufficient pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies and evidence of safety provided by three clinical trials to support this indication and to provide adequate directions for use. Evidence of safety is based on a database of approximately 600 pediatric patients with symptomatic GERD including 8 patients with EE.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table of Figures</head><p>These two efficacy supplements (sNDA 22-020 S-001/002 and sNDA 20-987 S-036/037) were submitted in response to a Written Request (WR) originally dated December 31, 2001. The pediatric trials per the WR were designed to study the effectiveness of Protonix in short-term treatment of symptomatic GERD. The Applicant fairly met the requirements of the WR and received exclusivity on Feb 17, 2009. However, it appears that when the WR was issued, the pediatric trials were designed with the assumption that efficacy could be extrapolated from the adult indication to the pediatric indication. There is a fundamental flaw in this assumption, as the adult indication for Protonix is short-term healing of erosive esophagitis <ref type="bibr">(EE)</ref>, which is considered a distinct entity from short-term treatment of symptomatic GERD.</p><p>The adult trials to support the indication for treatment of EE studied a distinct patient population in which healing of EE lesions was used as the primary endpoint. Whereas in the pediatric trials, relief of symptoms was studied. In adults, relief of GERD symptoms was studied as a secondary endpoint, however, the assessment technique was different and can not be used to directly compare the data between adults and children.</p><p>(b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(4)</ref> Clinical Review Ii-Lun Chen, M.D. sNDA 22-020/20-987 Protonix for Delayed-Release Oral Suspension/Protonix Delayed-Release Tablet <ref type="bibr">(pantoprazole sodium)</ref> Other than the pediatric trial involving infants, birth to 11 months old, all other pediatric trials were dose ranging studies without an active comparator or placebo-control. The pediatric trials relied on being able to extrapolate efficacy from the adult data. The trials were not powered to detect dose response. Nor was there a clear dose response within the patients studied to support efficacy on its own.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Risk Benefit Assessment</head><p>Overall, there were no major safety signals and Protonix (pantoprazole) appears to be well tolerated in the pediatric population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pediatric Patients Less than One Year of Age</head><p>According to my review of the clinical data, the efficacy data did not support the proposal for treatment in the age group one month to less than one year. There was no difference in withdrawal rates between infants treated with once daily administration of pantoprazole pediatric suspension and those given placebo in the treatment of GERD symptoms in infants (age 1 month to 11 months). These efficacy results were consistent across all methods of assessment in this trial. No statistically significant differences were observed between treatment groups for any baseline demographic characteristics, or in the percentage of patients with various GERD symptoms reported by diary during baseline.</p><p>After the initial four week open-label treatment phase, the mean symptoms score improved from baseline score of 5.38 to <ref type="bibr">3.58</ref>. Although this was a statistically significant improvement, we do not have a clear understanding of the clinical meaningfulness of this change in symptom score. The placebo-control is valuable in allowing us to understand that Protonix, as studied in these infants, does not appear to be any more effective than placebo. It could be argued that the short four-week course of treatment had a lasting effect such that the withdrawal rates after the openlabel treatment is not expected to be vastly different between those on continued treatment and those randomized to placebo.</p><p>To date, we do not have approval of PPI use in the young infant population less than one year of age. However, PPIs are commonly used in this age group despite lack of known effectiveness. Pharmacodynamic studies to date do demonstrate that acidity is suppressed in infants when treated with PPIs, despite this, efficacy has not been adequately demonstrated in a clinically meaningful manner. Previous trial designs for other PPIs have varied from a four week, doubleblind, randomized, placebo-controlled and a treatment-withdrawal type design. We need better understanding of why efficacy has not been demonstrated in the infant population prior to 10 Clinical Review Ii-Lun Chen, M.D. sNDA 22-020/20-987 Protonix for Delayed-Release Oral Suspension/Protonix Delayed-Release <ref type="table">Tablet (pantoprazole sodium)</ref> pursuing more PPI studies in this age group. It is possible that there are a few infants who have acid-induced esophageal damage and respond to PPI treatment, but overall true erosive esophagitis is uncommon in the infants, likely that it takes time for this to develop. It is possible that in young infants the pathogenesis for most feeding associated regurgitation and irritability is not related to acidity, and thus we do not see difference in responder rates between PPI treatment and placebo. Uncomplicated reflux in infants is known to spontaneously resolve in over 95% of cases by 18 months of age. 1 Challenges of studying this patient population include need for more specific and sensitive assessment tools for this age group with an increased understanding if the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of gastrointestinal discomfort/regurgitation in this age group is similar to GERD in adults, whether behavioral conditioning is a factor, the role of maturation and ability of infant to start solids and feed sitting in improvement of symptoms, ethical considerations with use of invasive diagnostic procedures such as endoscopy to obtain more objective findings, and designing a trial to capture treatment effect appropriately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pediatric Patients Ages One Year through Sixteen Years</head><p>The clinical outcome trials were not powered to detect treatment differences between the dosages studied. The results from the clinical trials provide supportive data that pediatric patients ages 1 year through 16 years old improve on treatment, and PK/PD trials in the same age groups also provide support of treatment effect similar to that seen in adults on pantoprazole treatment. Although there were only eight patients with EE in this submission, all these patients healed with Protonix treatment as demonstrated by endoscopic findings. This was for me the most convincing evidence that Protonix has effectiveness in children as in adults, although I would have preferred to have a larger sample size and age distribution. Given the combined supportive evidence of effectiveness for short-term improvement of EE associated with GERD in pediatric patients older than 1 year of age and the lack of new safety signals, the use of pantoprazole is warranted.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Recommendations for Postmarket Studies/Clinical Trials</head><p>There exists a complicating factor in this submission in that all the pediatric patients were not studied using the same Protonix formulation (see Section 2.1 for more details). Pediatric patients 1 year through 5 years were studied using newly developed pediatric granules (distinct from the currently marketed adult granules in both chemistry and pharmacokinetics) and patients 5 years through 16 years were studied using the currently marketed adult tablets.

(Commitment ID: 4851) This was fulfilled by submission of the PWR studies. "Deferred pediatric study under PREA for the maintenance of healing of EE in pediatric patients ages birth to seventeen years." (Commitment ID: 4853) This was fulfilled by Wyeth completing a literature review as specified by the Agency. At this time, the DGP does not wish to pursue clinical trials to study the maintenance indication in the pediatric population until there is a better understanding of the safety with chronic use of PPIs in the adult population.</p><p>There are no outstanding PREA requirements for NDA 20-987: There were two non-PREA-related PMCs, one of which (pharmtox study) was fulfilled.</p><p>The other is a clinical study, "Long-term prospective observational study of the incidence of cancer among pantoprazole users compared to an appropriate control group." This is ongoing since 2004 and expected completion is in 2011.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Introduction and Regulatory Background</head><p>Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is a common condition that involves regurgitation, or "spitting up," which is the passive return of gastric contents into the esophagus. Typical pattern of GER activity in infants peaks between one and four months of age 2 , and usually resolves by 6 to 12 months of age. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Regurgitation has been reported almost half of infants but is negligible by one year of age.</p><p>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common, chronic gastrointestinal disorder commonly known as "heartburn," is thought to occur in 2% to 7% of children. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">4</ref> GERD is known to cause erosive esophagitis (EE) due to the abnormal reflux of acidic gastric fluid into the esophagus when the esophageal sphincter is overly lax. When patients develop EE, their esophageal lining is inflamed and ulcerated. Other complications of GERD are esophageal strictures and Barrett esophagus. Endoscopy is commonly used to diagnose GERD and its severity. GERD is a pathologic process in infants with poor weight gain, signs of esophagitis, persistent respiratory symptoms, and changes in behavior. Approximately 0.3% of infants present with abnormal signs and symptoms that warrant a diagnosis of GERD. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">5</ref> GERD appears to be more resistant to complete resolution after the first year of life. A higher prevalence of GERD is noted in children who have co-morbid conditions. Initial management of infants diagnosed with GERD is a nonpharmacologic approach that includes: feeding modifications, positioning changes, and reduction or elimination of tobacco smoke from the infant's immediate environment. Infants and children that continue to have symptoms after dietary and lifestyle modifications may require medication.</p><p>Long-term use of antacid treatment in pediatric GERD is not generally recommended. Aluminum absorption from antacid use, such as in sucralfate, can occur in infants approaching levels reported to cause osteopenia and neurotoxicity. Prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide, are used in the treatment of GERD in infants and children, but there is not substantial evidence of effectiveness. Adverse effects are common with metoclopramide therapy and include extrapyramidal side effects. Histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2-RAs) are available and are generally safe and effective. See irritability that have not responded to H2-RAs. PPI's have also been used in pediatric patients with feeding resistance or dysphagia, asthma, recurrent pneumonia, or GERD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Product Information</head><p>Pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate, 5-(difluoromethoxy)-2-[[ <ref type="bibr">(3,4-dimethoxy-2-pyridinyl)</ref> methyl]sulfinyl]-1Hbenzimidazole, monosodium salt, sesquihydrate, which may also be referred to as pantoprazole or pantoprazole sodium, is a substituted benzimidazole derivative that binds covalently to the gastric acid pump H+, K+-ATPase. Pantoprazole, a PPI, is an acid-activated, irreversible inhibitor of the H+, K+-ATPase of parietal cells and produces prolonged suppression of gastric acid secretion, as do other PPIs such as omeprazole and lansoprazole. The Applicant proposes Protonix be indicated for the treatment of short-term gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in pediatric patients birth through 16 years of age.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Availability of Proposed Active Ingredient in the United States</head><p>Pantoprazole is available in the United States as delayed-release tablet (20 mg or 40 mg) and delayed-release granules for oral suspension (40 mg). The adult granules on the market also suffice as a pediatric age appropriate formulation, but for historical reasons the two granule formulations took separate development tracks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Important Issues With Consideration to Related Drugs</head><p>Lansoprazole (Prevacid) is the first PPI that has completed a clinical trial in the patient age population 1 month to &lt;12 months of age. The safety and effectiveness of PPIs [omeprazole (Prilosec), rabeprazole (Aciphex), pantoprazole (Protonix), lansoprazole (Prevacid), and esomeprazole (Nexium)] are currently approved for several acid-related conditions in adults in the U.S. as of the writing of this document.</p><p>There is class labeling for the Warning and Precautions section: "Symptomatic response to [specific PPI name] does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy." For a number of the PPIs, there is also a warning stating that atrophic gastritis has been noted on biopsy from patients treated with long-term PPI. Also, there have been reports of false-positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol in patients taking PPIs.</p><p>Pantoprazole is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes. The major metabolic pathway of pantoprazole involves the enzyme CYP2C19, and the minor metabolic pathways involve the enzymes 3A4, 2C9, and 2D6. There have been postmarketing reports of INR and prothrombin time (PT) in subjects receiving PPIs, including pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and PT may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with PPIs and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and PT.</p><p>PPIs are thought to have a potential to interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is important for bioavailability. Lastly, it is recommended that Protonix is not administered with atazanavir, as decreased atazanavir levels are expected which would reduce its therapeutic effect. This current submission is a response to the Protonix PWR and reflects trials evaluating the short-term use of pantoprazole sodium for the treatment of symptomatic GERD in pediatric patients from preterm infants and neonates through 16 years of age.</p><p>(b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(4)</ref> As reflected in official meeting minutes from FDA (Jun 23, 2005, t-con for Protonix Granules NDA), Wyeth understands that the pediatric data submitted in this sNDA is intended to satisfy all requirements of PREA and BPCA to provide important information for the safe and effective use of pantoprazole in pediatric patients by the due date of Dec 31, 2008. There was agreement made regarding endpoints for the PWR studies at this time.</p><p>During the current review cycle, consultation with Mike Jones to discuss user fee issues with the submission uncovered that at the time of submission, Wyeth should have paid two user fees as (b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(4)</ref> this sNDA submission consists of clinical data pertaining to two formulations: pediatric granules and adult tablets.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.1">Mechanism of Action</head><p>This class of drugs is used in the treatment of gastric acid-related symptoms and pathology, such as GERD with or without EE. The primary advantage of treatment with PPIs is that they act directly on the final step in the acid-secretion pathway. An age-appropriate formulation of pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release granules has been developed for administration in patients who are unable to swallow tablets. Pantoprazole has shown therapeutic potential in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, EE, and hypersecretory states in adults.</p><p>Like other benzimidazole derivatives such as omeprazole and lansoprazole, pantoprazole undergoes a molecular rearrangement in an acidic environment that is necessary for its activity.</p><p>Although it is amphoteric, pantoprazole acts as a weak base (approximate pKa of 4.0) that is protonated in the low pH environment of the parietal cell secretory canaliculi. The protonated species forms a tetracyclic sulfenamide, which then becomes covalently bound to cysteine residues of the H+, K+-ATPase or gastric proton pump.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.2">Pharmacodynamics</head><p>The effect of dose on pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters was evaluated for patients aged 1 through 11 months old. The dose of 1.2 mg/kg resulted in statistically significant increase in PD parameters which were (1) the mean intragastric pH and (2) the mean percentage of time for intragastric pH &gt;3 and &gt;4. The lower dose 0.6 mg/kg did not result in any statistically significant change in PD parameters. However, there was no statistically significant difference between dose groups for changes in any PD parameters, thus, no dose-response was observed for PD parameters. Based on these results, dose of 1.2 mg/kg was chosen for the efficacy trial for patients 1-11 months old of age.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.3">Pharmacokinetics</head><p>The following are the main concepts from the preliminary clinical pharmacology review by Dr. adults after 40 mg pantoprazole. More specifically, systemic exposure of pantoprazole in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years old of age was lower than in healthy adults when the equivalent body-weight based dose was administered. For patients 12 to 16 years of age, the 40 mg dose resulted in similar AUC and Cmax to that in adults taking a 40 mg dose. The apparent oral clearance varied among age groups. Body weight is the key covariate affecting pantoprazole clearance in pediatrics patients &gt;3 years of age. For children &lt; 1 year old, clearance is reduced 20 to 80% of the adult value and at age 3, the age factor reduces clearance only 5%. The bioequivalence between pediatric granules and the marketed formulations i.e. tablet and adult granules (Delayed-Release Oral Suspension) was not demonstrated, however, there is sufficient bridging data to dose pediatric patients using either granule formulation. ¾ Mean AUC and Cmax of pediatric granules was considerably lower than that of adult 40mg tablet. Furthermore, pediatric granules are not bioequivalent to the marketed delayed-release oral suspension for Cmax. The mean Cmax of the adult granules is approximately 18% higher compared with the pediatric granules. For Cmax, the 90% CI for the ratio of the geometric means between the adult and pediatric granules was from 108% to 129% and did not fall within the bioequivalence window of 80% to 125%. ¾ The mean AUC of the adult granules was about 6% higher than the pediatric granules. For AUC, the 90% CI for the ratio of the geometric means between the adult and pediatric granules was from 100% to 113% and falls within the bioequivalence window of 80% to 125%. ¾ Reviewing the values and confidence intervals for these various parameters, it appears that a 10% increased adjustment in the pediatric granule dosing would bring its PK parameters within bioequivalence specifications to the marketed adult granules. Six patients were identified as CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. The clearance of Protonix in these patients was decreased by 95% compared to extensive metabolizers and the dosenormalized AUC was approximately five fold increased. Although no major safety signal was reported in these patients, it is a small sample. Therefore, for known CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, a dose reduction should be considered.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Sources of Clinical Data</head><p>Clinical data consists of four safety and effectiveness trials, four PK/PD studies, and four supportive studies. Theses are described in more detail in the following tables.   </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Review Strategy</head><p>The four clinical outcome protocols were reviewed in detail individually for effectiveness and safety. The four pharmacokinetic trials were reviewed in detail for safety evaluation only. The four supportive clinical trials (not part of the PWR requirement) were reviewed briefly for safety evaluation only. All eight protocols were reviewed for an integrated safety evaluation. Clinical outcome trials were not integrated across age groups, as there were slightly different trial designs and use of assessment tools between the trials.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Review of Efficacy</head><p>For children ages 1 year through 16 years, efficacy of Protonix in the short-term treatment of EE associated with GERD is extrapolated from the adult data. The primary endpoint studied was the improvement of symptoms associated with GERD which is different than in the adult trials which primarily studied the healing of lesions due to erosive esophagitis associated with GERD. The trials for the pediatric patients in this age group did not have a placebo control or an active comparator, and there was no clear demonstration of dose response. Although the trials in patients ages 1 year through 16 years did not have negative outcomes, efficacy of Protonix in pediatric patients in the short-term treatment of symptomatic GERD can not be established independently.</p><p>In general, the inclusion criteria (other than age), exclusion criteria, concomitant medications, prohibited medications, treatment duration, and monitoring schedule were similar across all trials. One major difference in inclusion criteria involves the two trials with patients ages 1 year through 5 years and 5 years through 11 years. These patients were required to have endoscopically proven symptomatic GERD. For older patients 12 years through 16 years, endoscopy was not required prior to trial entry.</p><p>In the adult trials, no clear dose response could be demonstrated solely based on GERD symptom improvement. In adults, a dose-response and superiority of 40 mg could only be demonstrated when healing of EE or maintenance of healing was assessed. In a pivotal adult trial studying the healing rates of EE after eight weeks of treatment, pantoprazole 20 mg and 40 mg were superior to placebo by 45 and 55% respectively. In this trial, the secondary endpoint was overall absence of GERD symptoms. Unlike in the pediatric trials, the Applicant used a life-table approach to produce survival-type curves for each treatment group to represent time to absence of symptoms. The following was copied from Dr. Hugo <ref type="bibr">Gallo-Torres' June 30, 1998, review of NDA 20-987:</ref> Dr. Gallo-Torres concluded that, "the panto 40 mg dose was significantly more efficaciousbeginning in the first week of therapy -than placebo in the persistent absence of any symptom, daytime heartburn, nighttime heartburn, and regurgitation associated with erosive esophagitis…approval of pantoprazole 40 mg once-a-day (4 to 8 weeks) for the healing of erosive esophagitis and the relief of symptoms associated with GERD is recommended." However, Protonix tablet and suspension currently are only labeled for the short-term treatment of EE associated with GERD and is not indicated for the relief of symptomatic GERD. In trials with patients ages 1 year through 12 years old, there were eight patients with EE who were enrolled. None of the patients with EE was given the lowest dose, therefore we do not know for certain if a lower dose could be recommended for these patients even though GERD symptoms were reported to improve significantly with low dose treatment for patients age 1 year through 11 years old. Given the limitations of the number of EE patients studied, understanding dose response could have been improved had there been more EE patients studied at varied doses.</p><p>There are a number of statistical issues that are noted. First, the number of patients studied in the clinical trials for children ages 1 year through 16 years were based on regulatory and practical needs and was not set by statistical power. There was inadequate power to detect treatment difference with the number of patients studied. Second, due to the small number of patients enrolled, the baseline symptom scores were different between treatment groups.</p><p>For the clinical trials, comparison was done between treatment groups adjusting for weight and age subgroups. These analyses did not show large differences between treatment groups. Change in symptoms scores among treatment groups was more consistently correlated with baseline severity. That is, there was a tendency for the patients with higher baseline values (more severe symptoms) to show most improvement at end of trial.</p><p>The difference in age groups and trial designs precluded integration of the effectiveness results across the four clinical outcome trials. The trials are different in: dose regimens, symptom assessment tools, symptomatic versus endoscopically-proven symptomatic GERD. Because of different GERD manifestations due to age, they used different effectiveness endpoints. Thus the trials are individually described.</p></div>

The run-in phase was placed to eliminate patients who would respond to environmental management and not require medical therapy. Also, inclusion of such patients could exaggerate the efficacy of the treatment effect. Then, 108 patients were randomized with 106 in the mITT population. These patients continued conservative treatment throughout the trial. Throughout the trial, an eDiary was used to collect data on GERD symptoms, respiratory symptoms, and rescue antacid use.</p><p>Patients whose symptoms resolved with conservative treatment were withdrawn from the trial. Patients whose symptoms failed to improve and who satisfied all the eligibility criteria entered a four-week treatment run-in phase and received open-label oral pantoprazole daily. Patients were stratified by body weight as of Visit 4 and randomly assigned to receive either pantoprazole or matching placebo daily for four weeks. During the double-blind phase, patients were monitored closely to allow for prompt discontinuation from the trial due to a lack of efficacy of their assigned test article or if otherwise clinically appropriate.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion of assessment tools used:</head><p>GSQ-I The GSQ-I assessed five GERD symptoms in infants over the preceding seven days (vomiting/regurgitation, irritability/fussiness, refusal to feed, choking/gagging, arching back). An eDiary was distributed to the parents at the end of the screening visit to be completed daily, in the evening between six pm and midnight. The eDiary script assessed the five GERD symptoms using a 24-hour recall of the symptoms during the previous 24-hour period during screening and for eight weeks during treatment. The total mean weekly GERD symptom frequency was calculated each week. The eDiary also captured respiratory symptoms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GSQ-YC</head><p>The GSQ-YC assessed five GERD symptoms in children ages 1 year through 5 years. The frequency of the GERD symptoms over the preceding seven days was assessed. The symptoms assessed for GERD were: vomiting/regurgitation, abdominal pain, refusal to eat, choking when eating, and difficulty swallowing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GASP-Q</head><p>The GASP-Q was used in children 5 years through 16 years to measure the frequency and severity over the previous seven days for the eight symptoms presented: vomiting/regurgitation, abdominal pain, pain after eating, choking when eating, difficulty swallowing, burping/belching, nausea, and chest pain/heartburn. The ISS (Individual Symptom Score) is the product of the frequency and usual severity of each symptom. The sum of the ISS values made up the CSS. The Applicant analyses suggest that an improvement of 40% to 50% in GERD total symptom frequency based on GASP-Q or eDiary and an improvement of 50% to 60% in the composite symptom score based on GASP-Q for an 8-week treatment is likely to be clinically meaningful with reasonable sensitivity and specificity using the PGA as a comparator.</p><p>SEALD (Endpoints and Labeling Team) was consulted to evaluate the assessment tools used to study Protonix in the pediatric population. There were prior agreements made between the Applicant and the Agency in 2005 to use the GERD Symptom Questionnaire for infants and the GSP-YC as endpoints to evaluate drug effectiveness. The review from SEALD does provide suggestions for consideration when evaluating these previously agreed upon endpoints. The following are comments copied from Dr. Paivi Miskala's review dated <ref type="bibr">April 3, 2009</ref>.</p><p>• In the absence of empiric evidence for content validity of the proposed instruments in the target population, DGP should carefully evaluate the item content of these questionnaires from clinical perspective to make sure that we are not missing any key clinical symptoms. Furthermore, it needs to be ascertained if the caregivers understand the instructions, the concepts behind the items and the response options. Optimally, evidence should exist that each of the symptom-related behaviors contribute with equal importance to the summary score. If not, then the summary score is less interpretable as a measure of GERD symptom-related behaviors. DGP reviewer comment: Content seems appropriate.</p><p>• The Applicant's proposed description of the endpoints in the product labeling is not appropriate. The word " in the proposed label does not reflect what was actually measured by the instrument.</p><p>o For infants and young children, the parents are observing frequency or duration of child's behavior, not symptoms per se. These behavior assessments should be clearly described as observer-based in the product label. Please note that parent report on the amount of time a young child complained of stomach/belly pain may not truly reflect the amount of pain child has. It is also noted herein that "amount of time" used as some of the instruments' item responses is a measure of duration, not frequency. o For older children, the composite score takes into consideration parent assessment of observable and non-observable symptoms, both their frequency and severity. It is this reviewer's impression that the child may not have been asked about the symptoms when parent was making the assessment. If the child was not asked for input on non-observable symptoms in particular then this questionnaire is problematic. Information should be requested from the Applicant to clarify this issue. It is noted that, generally, the Agency does not consider proxy-assessments adequate to support efficacy claims in medical product labeling. DGP reviewer comment: Agree with SEALD comments, Applicant replied that parents were interviewed and child participation was encouraged. Overall, the answers to questionnaires were observer based and not patient reported. • It appears that the GASP-Q was interviewer (coordinator)-administered during some visits; however, the questionnaire is not in an interviewer format. Specific details related to this should be requested from the Applicant. It will be important to establish that the interview did not include additional filtering/interpretation of the responses by the interviewer. DGP reviewer comment: Standardized procedures were placed to limit subjective input.</p><p>• Usability/feasibility testing of the eDiary suggests that parents have difficulty differentiating wheezing from stridor. DGP should take this into consideration when evaluating these outcomes. DGP reviewer comment: Respiratory symptom evaluation is considered secondary and understandably difficult to interpret.</p><p>• Parent-reported data from open-label trials and treatment periods should be interpreted with caution because it is difficult to determine whether any observed differences in subjective assessments are real or due to bias. DGP reviewer comment: Agree.</p><p>• Exploratory evaluation of outcome data by fairly narrow age groups may be useful to determine that developmental differences do not influence efficacy findings. DGP reviewer comment: Agree that this is a possible consideration for further evaluation if necessary.</p><p>• Infant trial 3001B3-333-WW was conducted worldwide; however, the Applicant submission does not contain information on translation and cultural adaptation of the GERD Symptoms Questionnaire for infants. Therefore, we are uncertain whether the instrument is understood same way in different cultures and languages. SEALD recommends an exploratory analysis of the data by country in order to determine whether a treatment effect was demonstrated in all. DGP reviewer comment: As the infant trial did not meet its primary endpoint, further analysis of the data will not be conducted.</p><p>• Calculation of intrasubject (or intraobserver in this case) variability (day-to-day or week to-week) may be useful to evaluate whether the changes observed in the scores are likely appreciable by the subjects. This could be calculated by the DGP statistician if the trial data is in house. DGP reviewer comment: Possible consideration for further analysis if necessary.</p><p>• SEALD also recommends evaluation of the cumulative distribution function of responses between treatment groups to characterize the treatment effect and examine the possibility that the mean improvement reflects different responses in subsets of patients. DGP reviewer comment: The trials were not powered to detect treatment difference. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Infants 1 Through 11 Months</head><p>The primary endpoint was the proportion who withdrew due to lack of efficacy during the treatment-withdrawal phase. Lack of efficacy was defined as one or more of the following conditions:</p><p>Significant worsening of GERD symptom frequency (i.e., weekly GERD symptom score returned to baseline or above on two consecutive weekly evaluations not related to an intercurrent illness). OR A diagnostic test such as endoscopy demonstrates the worsening of esophagitis.</p><p>OR Maximal antacid used for seven continuous days.</p><p>OR Severe GERD symptoms based on physician's judgment, not related to intercurrent illness, as documented at an unscheduled or scheduled visit.</p><p>OR Investigators determined if a patient should be withdrawn for lack of efficacy</p><p>The primary efficacy parameter of the trial was the difference in withdrawal proportion between the two treatment groups during the double-blind phase because of a lack of efficacy. A comparison of withdrawal proportion is shown in the following table for the mITT population. There was no difference in proportion. In all, 12 patients were withdrawn from the trial for this reason: 6 patients in the pantoprazole 1.2-mg/kg group and 6 patients in the placebo group. The Kaplan-Meier plot of time to lack of efficacy per withdrawal criteria for the double-blind phase also shows no differences between the treatment and placebo groups.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Erosive Esophagitis Endoscopy Findings</head><p>The number of patients with EE (HD ≥2 at baseline) and with a healing of EE (HD &lt;2) at the end of trial were evaluated. There were four patients who had a diagnosis of EE: two in the mediumdose group and two in the high-dose group (patients with EE could not be randomized to the low-dose group). Repeat endoscopy demonstrated that all of the EE patients were healed at the final week of trial with HD scores of zero for all patients. Symptomatic GERD The weekly GERD symptom score (WGSS), defined as the sum of the five selected individual weekly GERD mean frequency scores for vomiting/regurgitation (item 1c), chocking/gagging (item 2a), refusal to eat (item 3a), difficulty swallowing (max of 4a and 4b) and abdominal/belly pain (item 5a).</p><p>The primary effectiveness analysis was the change in mean WGSS from baseline week to final week for the mITT NERD population. A box plot of WGSS for the mITT population at baseline and final week for patients with NERD is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> from the Applicant. The WGSS mean scores at baseline were 3.2, 2.4, and 3.4 for the low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively. By the final week the mean scores had decreased to 0.8, 1.8, and 1.7 for the low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively, indicating improvement in symptoms for all the dose groups. The low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups included 0, 4, and 2 patients, respectively, who had baseline WGSS &lt; 1. Interestingly, the low dose group has less variation in final week scores compared to the other treatment groups. The boxes represent the lower to upper quartile range.</p><p>Descriptive statistics and within-treatment comparisons of WGSS for the mITT population (last observation carried forward, LOCF) for patients with NERD is presented below. For the mITT population, there were statistically significant within-group decreases in the mean WGSS from baseline to final week for the high-dose (p &lt; 0.001) and the low-dose (p &lt; 0.001) groups, but the decrease was not significant for the medium-dose group (p = 0.06).</p></div>

See section 9.4.2 for descriptive summary of CSS statistics and within-treatment comparison by age and weight.</p><p>Furthermore, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> shows the change in WGSS from baseline to the final week as compared to the baseline WGSS for each of the treatment groups. This figure suggests that the change in WGSS is more correlated to baseline WGSS than to the assigned treatment group. That is, the improvement after eight weeks of treatment was better in patients with higher baseline WGSS (more symptomatic). Erosive Esophagitis Endoscopy Findings Four patients, including three patients in the 20 mg group and one patient in the 40 mg group, had EE and Hetzel-Dent scores grade ≥2 at baseline. At the end of the trial, all of these patients had a score of 0 (normal) or 1 and were healed. Specifically, the patient in the 40 mg dose group had initial HD score of 3 and at the final visit the HD decreased to 0. All three EE patients in the 20 mg group entered with a HD score of 2. At the final evaluation, two of the patients had HD score of 1 and one patient had a score of 0. Non-Erosive GERD Endoscopy Findings Endoscopy and histologic assessment of esophageal biopsies were evaluated for patients with pathology at baseline and post treatment. Of the 53 patients randomized, 4 had EE and 49 had non-erosive GERD (NERD). Of the patients with NERD, 80% had endoscopic evidence of erythema and 65% had moderate or severe esophagitis on biopsy at baseline. After treatment, 70% of the endoscopy results were normal and 72% of the biopsy results were normal or showed mild esophagitis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Symptomatic GERD</head><p>The primary endpoint was the change in the CSS as a measure of wellbeing from baseline to the final visit (week 8). <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 15</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> summarize the mean CSS values at baseline and week 8, along with the changes in the mean from baseline to the final evaluation. The mean CSS values improved statistically significantly from baseline to the final visit both for the ITT (p &lt; 0.001) and VFE (p &lt; 0.001) populations in all three dose groups. No large differences were seen in the mean CSS change from baseline among the treatment groups at week 8 (p &gt; 0.05). Of note, the standard deviations in the scores are large both at baseline and final week signifying a wide variability.  As in the younger 1 year to 5 years age group, the scatter plot below suggests that those patients with a higher baseline showed more improvement consistently across all three treatment groups. Subgroup analysis by age and weight did not show substantial differences between treatment groups. This suggests that improvement appears to be dependent on baseline severity more than age or weight subgroup.</p></div>

The primary endpoint was the change in the CSS from baseline to the last on-treatment evaluation at Week 8. For the ITT population, the CSS decreased approximately 100 points after eight weeks of treatment in both dose groups. This was a statistically significant change indicating improvement in symptoms (p&lt;0.001). Results for the VFE population were comparable, with an even larger decline observed for the 40 mg VFE patients. The following Table and Figure depict the results in more detail.  Consistent with the patients with ages 1 year through 11 years, the scatter plot of change in CSS from baseline to week 8 compared to baseline CSS for the adolescent age group suggests that change in CSS is correlated linearly to severity of CSS at baseline. </p></div>

Statistically significant decreases from baseline in the mean CSS of GERD symptoms were observed for all three treatment groups, starting at Week 3 and continuing to Week 10 (p &lt; 0.05).</p><p>These results indicate that symptoms improved faster in the 20 and 40 mg dose groups compared with the 10 mg dose group, which was also effective after two weeks of treatment</p><p>Age 12-16: The number of patients reporting each symptom decreased from baseline to Week 8 in the ITT population in both dose groups. The most common symptoms were abdominal pain/belly pain and burping/belching, reported by approximately 80% of patients in both treatment groups at baseline. At Week 8 these symptoms were reported by approximately 50% of patients. Difficulty swallowing showed the largest improvement, being reported by approximately 35% of patients at baseline and 10% of patients at Week 8. In addition to the number of patients with each symptom, the symptom frequency during each one-week period decreased from baseline to Week 8 in both dose groups. After eight weeks of treatment, the symptom frequency had decreased in most cases by half. However, the severity of symptoms did not change much after eight weeks of treatment.</p><p>A steady decline in mean CSS was observed in the ITT population throughout the course of the trial. A lower CSS was observed as early as Week 1. Results for the VFE population were comparable with the ITT population. The number of patients with a CSS below the entry criteria (less than 16) increased in both dose groups as the trial progressed. More patients in the 40 mg group achieved CSS below entry threshold at Week 1 (p = 0.048) and Week 6 (p =0.041) but not at week 8 (p = 1.00).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.8">Analysis of Clinical Information Relevant to Dosing Recommendations</head><p>Based on the four clinical outcome trials, my recommendation for Protonix dosing regimen would be the following: children one to five years old should start at 10 mg and 20 mg can be considered if symptoms are not sufficiently improving. For the older age children six years old and up, 20 mg daily is recommended with dosage up to 40 mg if symptoms are not improving adequately. Incorporating the analysis from the Pharmacometric and Clincal Pharmacology team members, the dosing regimen should be further refined as described below: of the pediatric granule C max missed the BE requirement by only 4%. There is sufficient PK data to suggest that a dosage adjustment would not be required when converting pediatric patients to using the adult granules, that is, the exposures in the pediatric patients would still fall comfortably within the range of exposure seen in adult patients during Protonix clinical trials. There do not appear to be safety concerns as: 1) there is a large margin of safety in general with this drug and 2) the division is recommending lower dosage than the Applicant. In addition, four trials in children and adolescents with oral and IV pantoprazole sodium that are supportive of PWR requirements (3001B3-335-WW, 3001A1-109-US, 3001K1-110-US, and 3001K1-117-US) were also conducted. The safety data was reviewed; however, as there were no concerning safety signals a written review was not included. In accordance with the pantoprazole PWR, in each trial, as well as in this summary, routine safety and tolerability parameters were measured and pooled for adverse events (AEs), treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), safety-related discontinuations, serious adverse events (SAEs), physical examination including growth parameters, vital sign measurements, laboratory evaluations, and 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs).</p><p>The safety population consisting of the eight trials in the PWR numbers 567 patients. There are 47 patients in the supportive trials not part of the PWR, 23 of whom received IV pantoprazole, most receiving only a single dose and none more than two days of treatment. No major safety signals were found.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.2">Categorization of Adverse Events</head><p>Terminology from the Coding Symbols for the Thesaurus of Adverse Reaction Terms (COSTART) is used to describe the adverse events to be consistent with the terminology used in previous pantoprazole trial reports and to facilitate the integration of pantoprazole datasets. Some demographic characteristics showed differences across the different dose groups because of trial design. Low-dose pantoprazole was used only in trial 328 (which involved patients 1 through 5 years of age) and trial 322 (which involved patients 5 through 11 years of age); therefore, all patients in the low dose group were in the 1 through 11 years age group. All 129 patients in trial 329, all of whom were infants 1 through 11 months, received high dose pantoprazole. Consequently, patients receiving high dose pantoprazole tended to be younger (4.7 years) than those receiving medium or low dose pantoprazole (7.8 years and 5.7 years, respectively), lighter (23 kg, 36 kg, and 26 kg, respectively), and shorter (95 cm, 120 cm, and 115 cm, respectively). Male and female patients were proportionately distributed across the three dose groups.  </p></div>

As expected, increasing body weight appears to be correlated with a decrease in exposure within each dose group. Given that AUC shifts depending on body weight and that the AUC does not change with age lends itself to concluding that dosing by body weight more appropriately matches adult AUCs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.1">Deaths</head><p>No deaths were reported in the eight trials submitted as part of the PWR. One (0.2%) patient died after completing trial 110, which is a supportive trial that was included with the submission but not part of the WR. The patient was a seven-year-old white male patient who, prior to trial enrollment, was hospitalized for a closed head injury secondary to a fall. The patient received two doses of IV pantoprazole 1.6 mg/kg. Five days after completing the trial, the patient had progressive neurologic deterioration as a complication of the closed head injury and had respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient was subsequently withdrawn from life support. The AE was considered unrelated to pantoprazole (Trial 110: An Initial Trial of the PK, PD, Safety and Tolerability of Intravenous Doses of Pantoprazole in Hospitalized Pediatric Patients).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.2">Nonfatal Serious Adverse Events</head><p>Overall, 23 (4%) patients reported at least one SAE. None of the SAEs was considered to be related to test article by the investigators. The event most commonly reported as an SAE was viral gastroenteritis which was reported in 3 (0.5%) infant patients. In two patients, seven events namely worsening of GERD, vomiting, dehydration, bronchiolitis, respiratory failure, stridor and otitis media were each reported as SAEs.</p><p>Infant trial: A total of eight patients had a total of 11 SAEs at some time during the trial, including screening and follow-up. The SAEs involved the following body systems: respiratory <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(4)</ref>, digestive <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(3)</ref>, metabolic and nutritional <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(2)</ref>, cardiovascular (1), and special senses (1).</p><p>Age 1-5 years trial: Two (2, 3%) patients had a total of three SAEs at some time during treatment in this trial. None of these SAEs was considered to be related to the trial drug. Two SAEs were of mild severity; one SAE was of moderate severity. The SAEs experienced by these two patients were abdominal pain, and anorexia and dehydration.</p><p>Age 5-11 years trial: No SAE reported.</p><p>Age 12-16 years trial: One SAE was reported in this trial. This patient was hospitalized at Week 5, for an inflamed gall bladder and a cholecystectomy was performed; the patient fully recovered and completed the trial. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.3">Dropouts and/or Discontinuations</head><p>Overall, 15 (2.4%) patients were withdrawn from the trial because of AEs. The AE resulting in the most withdrawals was headache (3 patients, 0.5%). Diarrhea, worsening of GERD, and sleep disorders each resulted in withdrawal of 2 (0.3%) patients. A listing of the patients who withdrew from pediatric trials because of AEs is presented: Overall, 551 (89.7%) of the 614 patients in the ISS population completed the trial in which they participated; 63 (10.3%) patients discontinued. A total of 13.7% of patients in the high dose group discontinued compared with 5.4% and 5.2% in the low and medium dose groups, respectively. Of note, low dose therapy was only used in trials 322 and 328 where treatment was for eight weeks each. The medium and high doses were used in more trials and therapy duration ranged from single doses up to eight weeks. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4.2">Laboratory Findings</head><p>The ISS dataset was reviewed for potentially clinically important (PCI) laboratory abnormalities that occurred during one or more of the trials for overall trend. In particular CPK, gastrin, triglyceride, Alk Phos, PTT, triglyceride, uric acid, and potassium were reviewed in detail as there were a number of patients with abnormal laboratory values in these parameters that warranted further evaluation as a potential safety signal. Further review of the submitted data does not show a dose response effect, nor is there a consistent trend seen across all age groups leading for concern. 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Vital Signs</head><p>There was no pattern in the percentages of patients with a PCI vital sign assessment that suggests a dose relationship. Nor were there consistent abnormalities in the PCI vital signs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4.4">Electrocardiograms (ECGs)</head><p>The ISS dataset was reviewed for ECG abnormalities see Appendix section 9.5 for details. Ontreatment PCI prolonged QTc interval was recorded in 5 infants (3%). However, at the end of the double-blind period, equal numbers of infants on treatment and placebo had prolonged QTc intervals. No other age group had PCI QTc lab values. Therefore, it is unlikely that there is a safety concern for QTc prolongation with drug treatment. The longest QTc interval at the end of treatment was 588 msec. Of note, ECGs were collected as a screening procedure and routine safety measurement and were not designed to collect QT interval data, thus no attempts were made to standardize equipment across sites. Also, ECGs in infants are difficult to obtain reliably due to crying and the difficulty of keeping infants still during the measurement.</p><p>There was on-treatment PCI prolongation in the QRS interval in 10% of patients (30/314), however, there was an inverse dose response relationship between drug and frequency of QRS prolongation. Specifically, 44% of the affected patients were in the low dose compared to 6% in the high dose. No children in the 12 to 16 year age group had PCI QRS prolongation. The longest QRS interval at the end of treatment was 93 msec. received low dose pantoprazole, 64.0% of patients who received medium dose, and 66.1% of patients who received high dose. The higher rate of TEAEs in the low dose group may reflect the longer mean duration of therapy received by those patients (approximately 56 days) as compared to the shorter duration of therapy for patients in the medium and high dose groups (approximately 37 days each).</p><p>The frequency of TEAEs appeared to increase in dose-dependent fashion consistent with a dose response for only two events. These was otitis media, reported in 2.7%, 2.8%, and 6.6% of patients in the low, medium, and high dose groups, respectively; and contact dermatitis (mostly non-fungal diaper rash), reported in 0, 2.4%, and 3.8% of patients in the low, medium, and high dose groups, respectively. However, analyses by age group showed that the large majority of episodes of otitis media and contact dermatitis occurred among infants, 83% of whom received high dose pantoprazole. In infants, there was no evidence of a dose or treatment relationship for either otitis media or contact dermatitis. The apparent dose response observed for the overall analysis may represent an artifact of data pooling resulting from the relatively high incidence of otitis media and contact dermatitis in the infant population, and the disproportionate number of patients in this age group who received treatment with high dose pantoprazole.</p><p>In contrast to otitis media and contact dermatitis, the frequencies of other TEAEs were reported to decrease with increasing dose. Among these were headache (27%, 15.2%, 9.0%), infection (13.5%, 11.4%, 6.3%), accidental injury (18.9%, 9.5%, 4.4%), and pharyngitis (13.5%, 7.6%, 5.7%), all of which were reported more commonly in the two older groups, which included all of the patients receiving low dose and a larger proportion of those who received medium dose pantoprazole.</p><p>Overall, SAEs were reported for 23 (3.7%) patients: 7 (3.3%) in the medium dose group, and 16 (4.4%) in the high dose group. No SAEs were reported in the low dose group. No SAE was considered related to treatment with pantoprazole. The event most commonly reported as an SAE was gastroenteritis, which was reported in 3 patients: 2 (0.5%) in the high dose group and 1 (0.5%) in the medium dose group. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Postmarket Experience</head><p>Information is derived from post-marketing surveillance data for children and adolscents younger than 18 years from the Applicant's safety database (AEs from spontaneous reports, literature, solictited, as well as reports from observational trials for pantoprazole were derived from PSURs prepared by Nycomed). The period covered is from Aug 2005 through May 2008. Marketing data on the sales volume to children and adolescents is not available, thus exposure data for the patient population less than 18 years of age is not available.</p><p>A search for pediatric AEs identified 34 cases with 71 associated AEs terms. Of these 12 cases (35%) were regarded as serious. No deaths have been reported.   Clinically, the efficacy of pantoprazole and other PPIs in inducing healing of erosive esophagitis in children seems to mirror that seen in adults. In both adults and children, the efficacies of different PPIs in healing erosive esophagitis are comparable. However, it should be noted that the prevalence of erosive esophagitis in children under age 12 is uncommon and is rarely seen at all in infants (less than 12 months). In adults, the efficacy of pantoprazole and the other PPIs in maintaining healing of erosive esophagitis, mirrors that of their efficacy in inducing healing; again in this regard, the efficacies of different PPIs are comparable. PPIs, however, are superior to histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) in maintenance of healing. For PPIs in general, and pantoprazole in particular, the drug effects in pediatric patients are similar as in adults. This is true in terms of the mode of action, the absorption and elimination pharmacokinetics of the pro-drug, and the "pharmacokinetics" of the inhibition of acid production by the activated drug. This reflects the common pathophysiology in children and adults, as well as the similar efficacy in healing erosive esophagitis and in the maintenance of healing. A retrospective review was conducted in children (ages 0.2 years through 17 years) with GERD with or without erosive esophagitis receiving PPI therapy, including pantoprazole, continuously for &gt; 1 year (PPIs: 6 to 127 months; pantoprazole: 9 to 64 months) including baseline and follow-up esophageal and gastric biopsies to assess frequency, duration of PPI dosing, symptom relief, gastrin levels, histologic findings, and adverse events. This trial found no significant differences between the various PPIs, their dose, duration of treatment, or frequency of administration in any biochemical, endoscopic, or histologic changes. The results of this retrospective trial suggest that continuous long-term pantoprazole and PPI therapy in pediatric patients is safe. Similar to adults, in another retrospective review in children (9 months to 11 years) with GERD, PPIs (omeprazole and lansoprazole) were found to be safe and effective during continuous use for up to 11 years. Few adverse reactions to these drugs occurred, and discontinuation of the drug was seldom indicated.</p><p>2. Wyeth further summarizes the literature search on the effects of PPIs with specific attention to pantoprazole found the following:</p><p>The results from the three short term trials with pantoprazole in children ages 5 through 17 years with symptomatic or symptomatic and endoscopically-proven GERD have shown that treatment with 10 to 40 mg pantoprazole is effective in reducing the clinical symptoms of GERD and is generally safe and well tolerated.</p><p>Pantoprazole was shown to be effective in improving clinical symptoms of GERD at different dosage in these age groups. Pantoprazole has shown to improve symptoms of endoscopically diagnosed GERD over 8 weeks of treatment compared with baseline, however, higher doses of 20 and 40 mg/day improved symptoms by one week of treatment.</p><p>The adverse effect profile of short-term treatment of up to eight weeks with pantoprazole in pediatric patients was similar to those described in the Protonix Package Insert for adults.</p><p>Additional trials up to eight weeks are either clinically complete or ongoing in children less than five years of age and in infants (&lt; 12 months) to assess the safety and efficacy profile of appropriate formulations of pantoprazole in these age groups.</p><p>In a recent trial, long term continuous use of PPIs for up to 11 years showed to be safe and efficacious in children (mean age 7.8 years) with GERD. The results of the long-term treatment (9 to 64 months) with pantoprazole (0.58 to 1.41 mg/kg) in children ages 6.1 through 15.9 years showed normal endoscopic and biopsy findings in 83% of children during and at the follow-up evaluations. Finally, the results of this literature search showed that although the data on the longterm safety of pantoprazole in the management of pediatric patients is limited, short-term therapy of 8 to 12 weeks appears to be safe and an effective therapeutic modality in children and adolescents with GERD between 5 to 17 years of age with symptomatic or endoscopically-proven GERD.</p><p>3. The Applicant states that on May 27, 2005, Wyeth submitted to IND 35,441 a critical summary of the clinical data (from the medical literature) that helped to determine if pediatric patients were at any increased risk with respect to proliferative changes in the gastric ECL cells. In addition, a complete report of a seven-day treatment in neonatal/juvenile dogs and an associated toxicokinetic report were submitted.</p><p>A new literature search with a cutoff date of April 29, 2008, was performed to update the summary on the effect of PPIs on ECL cells hyperplasia and pediatric population as a part of a complete response to the PWR. In summary, 15 new relevant citations were identified based on the specified search criteria. The Applicant concludes that pantoprazole sodium, when used at approved doses for eight weeks in infants, children, and adolescents with symptomatic GERD, is not likely to be associated with clinically significant increases in serum gastrin levels or with ECL cell proliferative changes.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(b) (4)</formula><p>Clinical Review Ii-Lun Chen, M.D. sNDA 22-020/20-987 Protonix for Delayed-Release Oral Suspension/Protonix Delayed-Release Tablet (pantoprazole sodium)</p></div>

The Applicant states taking into account factors including biologic plausibility, seriousness of the AE, medical condition for which pantoprazole is indicated, and frequency. Clinical trial data chosen as a reference included nine randomized controlled Phase 2 or 3 clinical studies with oral Protonix. The newly presented table of adverse reactions is an integrated listing of the frequencies of the adverse drug reactions from the nine studies, which may provide more meaningful information to the prescriber as compared to the three previous tables, by indication, in the current USPI. AEs not included in the newly proposed labeling include ambiguous terms such as abnormal ECG, skin disorder, and non-specified drug reaction.</p><p>Comment: The current extensive list of possible associated adverse reactions and post market reported events has been streamlined reasonably, and I agree with the method in which the Applicant has attempted to hone in on more relevant adverse reactions to help prescribing practitioners and patients. Trial 3001-B3-329 (Trial 329) is a Phase 3, multicenter, outpatient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, treatment-withdrawal trial of oral pantoprazole in approximately 130 infants aged 1 through 11 months who had symptomatic GERD. The trial was divided into an openlabel run-in phase, in which all patients received pantoprazole treatment for four weeks, followed by a four-week double-blind phase, in which half of the patients were randomly assigned to continue on pantoprazole and the other half were withdrawn to placebo.</p><p>The duration of the open-label run-in treatment phase of four weeks exceeded by several weeks the time to reach steady-state for pantoprazole, which is five days. This trial design ensured that gastric acid suppression by pantoprazole was at steady-state, to meet the Pediatric Written Request (PWR) guidelines.</p><p>The primary objective of this trial was to assess the efficacy of treatment with pantoprazole granules administered as an oral suspension in patients aged 1 through 11 months with symptomatic GERD. The difference in treatment-withdrawal rates due to lack of effectiveness was compared between two groups of patients: those who continued treatment with pantoprazole and those who received placebo.</p><p>Other objectives were to assess the safety, tolerability, GERD symptoms, respiratory symptoms, antacid use, compliance, and growth parameters in patients aged 1 through 11 months with symptomatic GERD.</p><p>The trial was conducted at 31 sites, including 18 sites in the United States, 5 sites in South Africa, 3 sites in Canada, 2 sites in Poland, and 1 site each in Belgium, Latvia, and Spain. A total of 129 patients received at least one dose of pantoprazole, 108 patients received at least one dose of trial medication in the double-blind phase of the trial drug, and 88 patients completed the trial.</p></div>

Amendment 1 <ref type="bibr">(Jun 14, 2006)</ref> was made before the start of the trial, and changed the trial design so that it complied with the revised PWR.</p><p>Clinical Review Ii-Lun Chen, M.D. sNDA 22-020/20-987 Protonix for Delayed-Release Oral Suspension/Protonix Delayed-Release Tablet (pantoprazole sodium) <ref type="bibr">Amendment 2 (Apr 16, 2007)</ref> was requested by the WR medical monitor to make minor administrative changes to several sections. The changes did not affect the way the trial was conducted.</p><p>Amendment 3 (May 3, 2007) was a country-specific administrative amendment prepared for the Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte in Germany. However, the trial was not conducted in Germany.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Inclusion</head><p>The trial population consisted of preterm, term, or postterm infants aged 1 through 11 months with symptomatic GERD. Preterm infants were defined as infants who were born before 37 complete weeks of gestation. Term infants were defined as infants who completed 37 to 42 weeks of gestation, and postterm infants were defined as infants who completed more than 42 weeks of gestation. Patients who met all of the following criteria were eligible: 1. Male or female term or postterm infants beyond the neonatal period &gt;28 days but &lt;12 months of age, or preterm infants with a corrected age of ≥44 weeks but &lt;12 months at the time the consent was signed. 2. Total GSQ-I mean symptom frequency &gt;16 at screening (week -2) and at baseline. 3. A clinical diagnosis of suspected, symptomatic, or endoscopically proven GERD. 4. Weight ≥2.5 kg and ≤15 kg. 5. Able to take test article orally.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Exclusion</head><p>Patients who met any one of the following criteria were not eligible for trial participation: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Treatment</head><p>The dose, 1.2 mg/kg pantoprazole sodium enteric-coated granules for suspension, was chosen on the basis of initial PK data from trial 3001B3-333-WW (Section 9.4.6), which was conducted in a similar patient population (infants aged 1 through 11 months). In Trial 329, effectiveness was compared with that of placebo in patients who had responded to four weeks of open-label treatment with the pantoprazole granules for suspension formulation.</p><p>Two strengths (5 mg and 10 mg) of pantoprazole were dispensed by weight group according to <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 26</ref> (from the Applicant) to achieve an approximate daily dose of 1.2 mg/kg. Medications used to treat non-GI conditions were allowed (with the exception of prohibited treatments listed), provided no dose adjustment was likely to be necessary during the trial. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Procedures/Safety Considerations/Monitoring</head><p>After screening, all patients received two weeks of standardized, nonpharmacologic, conservative treatment for GERD (hypoallergenic formula thickened with rice cereal, and instructions on feeding and positioning). Qualifying patients continued to receive this conservative treatment. An electronic diary (eDiary) was used to collect data on GERD symptoms, respiratory symptoms, and the use of rescue antacids.</p><p>After the two-week screening, the eDiary was also used to track patient compliance. Patients whose symptoms resolved with conservative treatment during screening were withdrawn from the trial. All patients whose symptoms failed to improve with the conservative treatment entered a four-week treatment run-in phase, and received open-label oral pantoprazole daily. (The terms "treatment run-in phase" and "open-label phase" refer to the same trial phase At Visit 1 and all subsequent visits, patients were provided with two or three 355-cc bottles of the marketed product Mylanta Supreme for US sites, Maalox Nighttime for Canadian sites, or Gaviscon Infant liquid antacid or local equivalent in other countries (containing 300 to 400 mg CaHCO 3 per 5 mL), which was to be taken if needed after five or more minutes of severe GERD symptoms as rescue. The dose of antacid was not to exceed 35 mg/kg/day or 87.5 mg CaHCO 3 /kg/day. Maximal antacid doses were to be given only to patients with low milk intakes.</p><p>Patients were brought to the investigative site for six trial visits (Weeks -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8), and telephone contacts were conducted at Weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7. For all patients who entered the treatment-withdrawal phase, a post treatment follow-up telephone contact occurred approximately two weeks after the final trial visit (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 27</ref>).</p><p>A central computerized randomization/enrollment (CORE II) system was used to assign randomization numbers. Randomization was stratified by weight (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 26</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Endpoints</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Measurements</head><p>The eDiary included a symptoms script that prompted parents to assess the frequency of GERD symptoms during the previous 24-hour period. The script, called the Caregiver Assessment of GERD Symptoms in Infants (CAGS-I), was based on the modified GSQ-I, which was previously developed to assess GERD symptoms in infants aged 1 through 11 months. Questions on the modified GSQ-I were adapted from the validated Infant Gastroesophageal Reflux Questionnaire (I-GERQ) by Orenstein and colleagues. The CAGS-I script included the following items: 1. Vomiting/regurgitation: 1a: Since last evening, how many times did the baby spit up (anything coming into or out of the mouth)? 1b: Since last evening, how much did the baby usually spit up (anything coming into or out of the mouth)? 1c: Since last evening, did spitting up (anything coming into or out of the mouth) seem uncomfortable (i.e., crying, fussing, irritability) for the baby? 2. Irritability/fussiness: 2a: Since last evening, did the baby cry or fuss during or after feedings? 2b: Since last evening, how many times did the baby either cry a lot during or within1 hour after a feeding? 2c: Since last evening, how much of the time did the baby cry or fuss? 3. Choking/gagging: 3a: Since last evening, during how many feedings did the baby choke or gag? 4. Arching back/head retraction:</p><p>4a: Since last evening, how many times did the baby have episodes of arching back? 5. Refusal to feed: 5a: Since last evening, how many times did the baby refuse feedings even when hungry? 5b: Since last evening, how many times did the baby stop eating even when hungry?</p><p>A Weekly GERD Symptom Score (WGSS) was calculated from five selected symptoms in the above list (items 1a, 2b, 3a, 4a, and the maximum of 5a/5b). WGSS was the sum of the weekly mean frequencies of these five symptoms.</p><p>In addition, the eDiary was used to assess the frequency of respiratory symptoms during the previous 24-hour period, based on the presence/absence of following items: 6a: Since last evening, did the baby have a cold or fever? 6b: Since last evening, did the baby have a cough without a cold? 6c: Since last evening, how much of the time did the baby have noisy breathing without a cold? 6d: Since last evening, did the baby have noisy breathing when breathing out? 6e: Since last evening, did the baby's breathing have a wheezy or whistling sound? 6f: Since last evening, did the baby have noisy breathing when breathing in? 6g: Since last evening, did the baby's breathing have a croupy or barky sound? 6h: Since last evening, did the baby stop breathing or turn blue or purple?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary Efficacy Variables</head><p>The primary endpoint was the withdrawal due to lack of efficacy during the treatmentwithdrawal phase. Lack of efficacy was defined as one or more of the following conditions:</p><p>Significant worsening of GERD symptom frequency (i.e., WGSS returned to baseline or above on two consecutive weekly evaluations not related to an intercurrent illness). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary Efficacy Variables</head><p>The secondary endpoints were as follows:</p><p>(b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(4)</ref> • Withdrawal for any reason.</p><p>• Time to withdrawal due to lack of efficacy, time to meeting the criteria for lack of efficacy, and time to withdrawal for any reason. • WGSS and individual mean frequency for each GERD symptom.</p><p>• The amount of antacid taken during each week and biweekly (every 2 weeks).</p><p>• The number of patients taking antacids during each week and biweekly.</p><p>• Respiratory symptoms, e.g., frequency of cough, noisy breathing in or out, breathing with a wheezy sound, breathing with a croupy sound, and stopped breathing (apnea).</p><p>Throughout the trial, routine safety and tolerability were evaluated from the results of reported signs and symptoms, scheduled physical examinations, vital sign measurements, height and weight measurements, 12-lead ECG recordings, clinical laboratory test results, and growth parameters, including z-scores for weight, height, and head circumference. Safety data were reviewed by the investigator and the WR medical monitor. The safety of pantoprazole was assessed on an ongoing basis by review of AEs and clinically laboratory test results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Laboratory Evaluations</head><p>Laboratory evaluations were performed as outlined in the Trial Flowchart. A central Laboratory, coordinated and provided each trial site with shipping supplies and detailed instructions for the shipment and storage of blood samples. All laboratory tests with values that were considered to be abnormal to a clinically important degree after test article administration were repeated until the values returned to normal or baseline.</p><p>Vital Signs and Growth Parameters Vital signs (tympanic or core temperature, supine blood pressure, supine pulse rate, and supine respiration rate) and growth parameters (height, weight, and head circumference) were measured and recorded during physical examinations. Other Safety Evaluations A standard 12-lead ECG recording was obtained during the pretrial screening at visit 1 and at the final visit of the treatment period (visit 6). Interpretations of the ECG recordings were provided by the investigator or a local cardiologist.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H. Data Analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Determination of Sample Size</head><p>In trial 3001A1-322-US, the dropout rate due to lack of efficacy among children aged 5 through 11 years treated with pantoprazole was 1 of 53 (1.9%). In a trial comparing famotidine to placebo in infants, reported by Orenstein and colleagues, the dropout rate for lack of efficacy in the placebo treatment group was 3 of 11 (27.3%). Assuming that the withdrawal rates in the pantoprazole 1.2 mg/kg and placebo groups in the current trial are 3% and 27%, respectively, it was determined that 38 patients per group entering the double-blind treatment-withdrawal phase would be needed to detect the assumed difference, using a 2-sided Fisher exact test at the 0.05 level with at least 80% power. It was further determined that approximately 136 patients total were to be screened to ensure that at least 38 patients per treatment group would enter the fourweek treatment-withdrawal phase of the trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis Populations</head><p>The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population was the primary analysis population and consisted of all patients who had a clinical diagnosis of GERD, completed the four-week openlabel treatment run-in phase with a minimum 21 days of test article administration, entered the double-blind treatment-withdrawal phase, and received at least one dose of double-blind treatment.</p><p>Two subsets of the mITT population were considered valid-for-efficacy (VFE). The VFE-1 population was included in all efficacy analyses and had the following characteristics:</p><p>• The patients were at least 80% compliant with test article during the double-blind phase.</p><p>• The patients were at least 60% compliant with completing eDiary symptoms in the double-blind phase (completing approximately 4 out of 7 days of eDiary per week). • The patients did not violate the protocol in a major way (i.e., have protocol violations that could affect trial analyses or results). • The patients participated for at least 21 days in the open-label phase.</p><p>The VFE-2 population, a subset of the VFE-1 population, was included in only those analyses involving withdrawal endpoints and had one additional characteristic:</p><p>• Patients who were at least 80% compliant with recording eDiary symptoms in the openlabel phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Parameters</head><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the withdrawal due to lack of efficacy during the doubleblind treatment-withdrawal phase. The withdrawal rate for each treatment group was defined as the ratio of the number of patients who were withdrawn from the trial due to lack of efficacy during the double-blind phase over the total number of patients who entered the double-blind phase. The withdrawal rates between treatment groups were compared using the Fisher exact test. The primary analysis population was the mITT population.</p><p>The same statistical methods used to analyze the primary efficacy endpoint were used to analyze the secondary endpoints of rate of lack of efficacy per withdrawal criteria and the rate of withdrawal for any reason. The rate of lack of efficacy per withdrawal criteria was the ratio of the number of patients who met the lack of efficacy withdrawal criteria during the double-blind phase over the number of patients who entered the double-blind phase. The withdrawal rate for any reason was the ratio of the number of patients who withdrew from the trial for any reason during the double-blind phase over the number of patients who entered the double-blind phase.</p><p>The other secondary efficacy parameters, such as time to withdrawal, WGSS, individual symptom frequency scores, and the amount of antacids used, were also analyzed. The change in amount of antacids used was analyzed in the same way as WGSS was analyzed. The selected respiratory symptoms (cough without a cold; noisy breathing when breathing in or out, wheezy breathing; croupy breathing; and apnea) were summarized by treatment group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Parameters</head><p>All patients who received at least one dose of test article in this trial made up the safety population and were included in summaries for safety evaluation. Summary results were presented by treatment group for all patients in the safety population as well as during open-label versus double-blind treatment phases. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disposition of Patients</head><p>A total of 154 patients with symptomatic GERD were screened for the trial at 31 investigative sites. Of those, 25 patients were screen failures. Among those who were screen failures, 6 patients did not meet the trial inclusion criteria (5 had a GSQ-I ≤16, and 1 did not meet the age requirement), 3 patients had clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results, and the remaining patients were screen failures because parents or caregivers were unable to comply with trial procedures, parental request, or withdrawal of consent. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discontinuations</head><p>The most common reasons for discontinuation of patients from the trial during the open-label treatment phase are shown in the table below. Altogether, 21 of 128 (16%) patients were discontinued from the trial during the treatment run-in phase of the trial. The most common primary reason for discontinuation was noncompliance, which occurred with 9 (7%) patients (noncompliance included being &lt;80% compliant with the eDiary or test article administration, or not completing trial visits). Other common reasons for discontinuation from the trial were as follows: 4 (3%) patients discontinued because of AEs and 4 (3%) patients had parental requests.</p><p>The most common reasons for discontinuation of patients during the double-blind treatmentwithdrawal phase are poor efficacy followed by protocol violation as also shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 28</ref>.   <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(11)</ref> Listed below are the patients with protocol violations or significant protocol deviations. Note that four patients in this trial had a total bilirubin test result at screening that exceeded the exclusion criterion ≥2 mg/dL, and were considered to be protocol deviations. The Investigators of all four patients considered the elevation in the total bilirubin result not to be clinically significant, and attributed to the benign condition of breast milk jaundice, which resolved as the patients matured. The medical monitor considered the values to be not clinically significant and approved the continued participation of all four patients. The mean compliance in the double-blind phase was 98% (equivalent across the two treatment groups).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographics</head><p>Baseline demographics of patients enrolled in the trial are described in the following table for the entire safety population. In general, most infants were full term and Caucasian. There was a slight imbalance in the male to female ratio in the higher weight infants compared to the lower weight infants. Note that in the double-blind portion, there were no significant differences in terms of demographic data between the patients randomized to pantoprazole versus placebo.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GERD Indications at Screening</head><p>All patients entering the trial had to have a clinical diagnosis of suspected GERD, symptomatic GERD, or endoscopically proven GERD. Although the trial procedures did not include any diagnostic investigations, a number of patients had diagnostic tests for GERD as part of their routine medical care before enrolling in the trial. The patients who had a history of non-trial tests for GERD at screening are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 32</ref>. A total of 43 (33%) patients entering the open-label phase had a history of non-trial diagnostic tests for GERD. Therefore, 100 (78%) of 129 patients who entered the trial did not have objective test results for GERD but had symptomatic GERD. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concomitant Therapy/Medications</head><p>Review of non-trial medications taken by patients at any time during the trial show that over 90% of the patients received some type of non-trial medication. The most commonly used products were vaccines, with viral vaccines given to 46 (36%) patients, bacterial vaccines given to 42 (33%) patients, and combined bacterial and viral vaccines given to 29 (23%) patients. Analgesics and antipyretics (other) were also widely used and were given to 63 (49%) of the patients. Antibiotic use was often reported; beta-lactams and penicillins were given to 29 (23%) patients, and other beta-lactams were given to 19 (15%) patients.</p><p>During the open label phase, 93 (73%) took non-trial medications, and none of the patients received drugs for treatment of GERD. During the double-blind phase, 70 (65%) patients took non-trial medications. One patient took a prohibited medication, buscopan, to treat an adverse event of abdominal cramps. There were no outstanding differences between the treatment groups in the use of non-trial medications in the double-blind phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Evaluation</head><p>The number and percentage of patients in each efficacy analysis population are summarized by treatment group in <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 33</ref>. The mITT population was the primary efficacy analysis population. This population consisted of all patients who had a clinical diagnosis of GERD, completed the four-week open-label treatment phase with a minimum 21 days taking test article, entered the double-blind phase, and received at least one dose of double-blind treatment. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary Efficacy Results in Double-Blind Phase</head><p>The primary efficacy parameter of the trial was the difference in withdrawal rates for lack of efficacy between the two treatment groups during the double-blind phase. The results show that there was no difference between treatment groups in withdrawal rates due to lack of efficacy. In all, 12 patients were withdrawn from the trial for lack of efficacy: 6 patients in the pantoprazole 1.2-mg/kg group and 6 patients in the placebo group. A comparison of withdrawal rates for lack of efficacy during the double-blind phase are shown in  The mean change from baseline was -1.9 with a standard deviation of 2.0 (p=0.001). WGSS During the Double-Blind Phase Looking at the change in mean WGSS from during the double-blind phase (Week 4 through Week 8) by treatment group, it is clear that there was no difference between treatment and placebo. The mean WGSS at week 4 is 3.4 (placebo) and 3.6 (pantoprazole). The mean WGSS at week 8 is 2.9 (placebo) and 3.2 (pantoprazole), the correlating mean change from Week 4 is -0.6 (placebo) and -0.4 (pantoprazole). See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> for a graphic description. There were overall no meaningful differences observed between the two treatment groups. A bar chart from the Applicant showing the contribution of the five selected GERD symptom components to the mean WGSS is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref>. Secondary Efficacy Results Secondary efficacy parameters included the time to withdrawal from the trial due to lack of efficacy, time to withdrawal from the trial for any reason, the individual mean frequency of each GERD symptom (discussed above), the amount of antacid taken each week, the number of patients taking antacids, and the presence of respiratory symptoms associated with GERD. There was no difference between treatment groups in the above three parameters when Kaplan-Meier estimates and log-rank tests were used to compare the two treatment groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Amount of Antacid Taken Each Week</head><p>The amount of antacid taken weekly decreased from a mean of 12mL at baseline to 7mL at Week 4 (7mL for patients randomized subsequently to placebo and 8mL for those enrolled into continued pantoprazole). At the end of the trial, the use of antacid decreased to 4 mL for those on placebo and 5mL for pantoprazole. The clinical meaningfulness of this small decrease in antacid use is questionable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Number of Patients Taking Antacids</head><p>At baseline 63% of patients used trial antacid at least once a week. At week 4, the number was reduced to 48% of patients. At the end of the trial 33% of patients on placebo compared to 39% of patients on pantoprazole were taking antacid weekly. There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Presence of Respiratory Symptoms Associated with GERD</head><p>The eDiary was used to document respiratory symptoms for the previous 24-hours. If the patient had a cold or fever, respiratory symptoms were not documented for that time period. Cold or fever occurred approximately 25% of the time in both treatment groups during the trial.</p><p>Cough without a cold, noisy breathing without a cold, noisy breathing when breathing out, breathing with a wheezy or whistling sound, noisy breathing when breathing in, breathing with a croupy or barky sound, and apnea were the questions assessed. Many of these symptoms were infrequent at baseline, so improvement is difficult to assess without a more sensitive assessment tool. Overall, there appeared to be improvements in respiratory symptoms in both treatment groups, but no differences between the treatment groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>J. Efficacy Conclusions</head><p>No statistically significant differences between treatment groups were observed for withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, meeting the criteria for lack of efficacy, or withdrawals for any reason in the mITT, VFE-1, and VFE-2 populations.</p><p>During the open-label phase, treatment with pantoprazole was associated with progressive improvements in WGSS over time. However, no relapse of symptoms was seen in the placebo group at the completion of the double-blind phase. As between-group comparisons during the double-blind phase showed no statistically significant differences, it questions the significance of the improvement in the WGSS symptoms seen during the open-label treatment phase. The frequency of the five individual GERD symptoms decreased significantly from baseline to</p><p>Week 4 during open-label treatment with pantoprazole, the caveat is that during this phase there was no comparator group. There was a significant decrease in vomiting/regurgitation, choking/gagging, and arching back in the pantoprazole 1.2 mg/kg compared with the placebo group at Week 5 but not at other weeks. Respiratory symptoms were not balanced between groups at baseline for noisy breathing and cough without a cold, there were more patients having these symptoms in the pantoprazole group compared to placebo, thus interpretation of data is challenging. General improvement in respiratory symptoms was seen, with greatest improvement during the first four weeks of treatment. There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the final analysis. One difficulty observed was that parents did not differentiate well between different types of noisy breathing. Apnea was very uncommon and unchanged with treatment.</p><p>The Applicant states that the results of this trial suggest that extensive conservative treatment along with rescue antacids plus possibly a four to five week course of PPIs may be sufficient for the majority of infants with symptomatic GERD. Furthermore, the Applicant states that patients with more severe symptoms or failure of conservative treatment might benefit from objective testing to assess their disease and to exclude other disorders such as cow's milk allergy, eosinophilic esophagitis, and infantile colic, which are often confused with GERD. Infants with clinically significant GERD should be considered for longer term pharmacologic therapy.</p><p>However, any conclusion of understanding if antacid therapy ameliorates GERD in infants has been tenuous at best. At this time, there has been no convincing evidence that supports use of PPI in this age group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Evaluation</head><p>As this trial is the only placebo-controlled trial among the eight PWR, the all safety parameters were evaluated carefully between treatment groups for comparison.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exposure</head><p>Days of trial-medication exposure are summarized in  None of the overdoses were associated with any AE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Serious Adverse Events</head><p>There were no deaths during this trial. A total of eight patients had a total of 11 SAEs at some time during the trial, including screening and follow-up. The SAEs involved the following body systems: respiratory <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(4)</ref>, digestive <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(3)</ref>, metabolic and nutritional <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(2)</ref>, cardiovascular (1), and special senses (1). None of the SAEs were considered to be related to the test article. Patient 329-045-001332 had been off trial drug almost two weeks when the syncopal event occurred. The two cases of GERD worsening occurred shortly after the open-label phase, when both patients were randomly assigned to placebo. The two cases of bronchiolitis also appear to be unrelated to trial drug as in Patient 329-050-001474, the patient had been off trial drug for five days due to a protocol violation when the SAE occurred. The second patient made full recovery from the infection while on trial drug.</p><p>However, for patient 329-064-001908 it is less clear that the trial drug did not potentially contributed to the SAE. Two days after starting treatment with open-label pantoprazole, the patient was admitted to the hospital with vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration and was diagnosed with viral gastroenteritis. Treatment with pantoprazole was interrupted. The patient was discharged in stable condition two days later. The investigator considered the SAE of gastroenteritis to be resolved and not related to treatment with open-label pantoprazole. However, another episode of diarrhea began a day later. The following day, after four days of test article interruption, open-label pantoprazole was restarted. The AE resolved 12 days later, but the patient developed another episode of diarrhea four days later. Seven days after the onset of this AE, the patient was discontinued from open-label pantoprazole and withdrawn from the trial because of the AE of diarrhea. Given the pattern of diarrhea, to appears that there is a likely relationship between drug treatment and this adverse event for this patient.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse Events</head><p>In total, 109 (85%) of 129 patients in the safety population had one or more AEs reported during the trial. Whereas, a total of 84 (66%) of 128 patients had one or more treatment emergent AE (TEAEs) during the open-label phase (these adverse events occurred after screening and medication had been dispensed). The most common TEAEs were upper respiratory infection (25; 20%), fever (13; 10%), and diarrhea (13; 10%). Other TEAEs were reported in at least 5% of patients were: otitis media (12; 9%), rhinitis (11; 9%), oral moniliasis (7; 6%), vomiting (7; 6%), and cough increased (7; 6%).</p><p>Altogether, 49 of 108 (45%) randomized patients had one or more TEAEs during the doubleblind phase, including 25 (46%) of 54 patients from the pantoprazole 1.2-mg/kg group and 24 (44%) of 54 patients from the placebo group. There were no notable differences between the two treatment groups. The most common TEAE was upper respiratory infection, which was reported in 7 (13%) patients in each of the treatment groups. The TEAEs that were reported in at least 5% of patients in the pantoprazole 1.2-mg/kg group and ≥ 2% as compared to placebo were: fever, otitis media, vomiting, and creatine phosphokinase increased. Overall, the differences between the two treatment groups do not appear to be clinically meaningful as the number of patients affected were small (e.g. fever reported: 3 (6%) Panto vs. 1 (2%) PBO).</p></div>

It is likely that there is some correlation between drug treatment and the adverse events, however, during the open-label phase there is no placebo group for comparison, and in the double-blind phase there was only one withdrawal due to AE, which is too few to make any conclusion.</p><p>Other Clinically Important Adverse Events Note that for the following lab values (Alk Phos, CPK, Gastrin, Triglyceride, PTT, Uric acid, and Potassium) a detailed analysis of potentially clinically important (PCI) lab values across all PWR trials is described in section 7.4.2.</p><p>There were nine patients with one or more laboratory test results that investigators reported as AEs; in six cases, the AEs were not test results that met predetermined PCI criteria. The patients with laboratory test results reported as AE were those with increased levels of Alk Phos (2 panto), AST and ALT (1 panto, 1 PBO), CPK (4 panto, 1 PBO), and triglycerides (1 panto, 1 PBO). Two parameters, CPK and gastrin levels, are notable as there were statistically significant changes that moved the means outside of the normal range. The investigator state that these were not clinically meaningful changes. Comment: As there was only one patient affected with this elevation, it is difficult to make any firm conclusion on the causality. Review of the other trials will be helpful to look for similar trends. For this patient the screen . Given the resolution of the ALT, short term treatment with pantoprazole does not appear to cause sustained elevations in ALT.</p><p>Bilirubin: PCI elevations of total bilirubin were found in four patients (329-043-001261, 329-043-001262, 329-045-001321, and 329-049-001446). In each case, the elevated bilirubin was thought to be due to preexisting breast milk jaundice and was observed only at screening. Bilirubin levels returned to normal at all subsequent assessments. An elevated bilirubin &gt;2mg/dL was an exclusion criterion to trial entry; however, each of these patients had a waiver from the trial's medical monitor to enter the trial.</p><p>Comment: The bilirubin levels, given their resolution during the trial, do not appear to be concerning and are likely unrelated to pantoprazole treatment. Highest bili was 18.8 mg/dL at wk 4.</p><p>Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK): PCI elevations of CPK levels at one or more laboratory evaluations occurred in five patients (329-016-000453, 329-032-000931, 329-041-001202, 329 049-001441, and 329-060-001775). All these patients had high CPK levels at screening, three of which were at PCI levels. In the three patients with PCI CPK levels at screening, the CPK levels remained elevated or declined to non-PCI levels after starting treatment with pantoprazole. In the two patients who had non-PCI CPK levels at screening, the PCI elevations occurred after the double-blind treatment-withdrawal phase; both patients had received placebo. Five additional patients had normal CPK levels at baseline and non-PCI elevations of CPK reported as AEs.</p><p>The mean CPK level in the safety population increased from approximately 165 mU/mL at baseline to 200 mU/mL at week 4, the end of the open-label phase, and to 209 mU/mL at the end of the double-blind phase. The between-group analyses, however, show that in the double-blind phase there were no significant differences between the treatment groups, with the mean CPK level decreasing slightly in the patients continuing on pantoprazole and increasing moderately (from a lower base) in those treated with placebo.</p><p>Comment: These data appear to indicate that elevations in CPK levels are relatively common in this patient population. The highest CPK reported was for patient 000453 at screen with a value of 690 mU/mL which decreased to 587 at wk 8. Short term treatment with pantoprazole does not appear to be a major risk for elevation of CPK given the current data.</p><p>Gastrin: Two patients (329-038-001122 and 329-054-001591) had PCI elevated gastrin levels.</p><p>In one patient, the gastrin level was PCI high at screening but dropped to a non-PCI high level at follow-up. In the other patient, the gastrin levels were non-PCI high at screening and at the end of the open-label phase but rose to a PCI high level at the end of the treatment withdrawal phase, during which time the patient received placebo.</p><p>Comment: This pattern of gastrin elevation for the above two patients does not appear consistent with drug effect. Overall, the mean serum gastrin level was higher at the end of both the open-label and the double-blind phases compared with baseline. All of the increase from baseline was accumulated during the open-label phase. In the double-blind phase, the gain in gastrin level was maintained (but not increased) in the pantoprazole 1.2-mg/kg group, but in the placebo group the gain was virtually lost by Week 8. This is an expected result given the mechanism of PPI. Comment: There are not sufficient data to indicate that treatment with pantoprazole causes a clinically significant increase in triglyceride levels. Highest reported triglyceride level was 6.5 mmol/L at wk 8 (no f/u information available).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aspartate aminotransferase (AST):</head><p>There was a significant (p=0.019) between-group difference in the changes in AST from baseline to Week 8, when an increase in AST was observed in the pantoprazole 1.2-mg/kg group but not in the placebo group.</p><p>Comment: Most of the increase had already accrued at week 4 before the patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups, and thus it is difficult to know if this elevation was caused by treatment with pantoprazole. A similar pattern is seen with ALT, although the differences between the groups did not achieve statistical significance. There were no adverse events that were associated with these elevations and do not appear to be clinically meaningful. upper respiratory tract infection, and bronchiolitis. Three patients had PCI high respiratory rates during the treatment-withdrawal phase; all these patients were receiving placebo.</p><p>The second most common PCI vital sign measurements were increases in systolic blood pressure (BP) readings, which occurred in three patients during the open-label treatment phase (1 patient at week 2 and 2 patients at week 4). Each patient had a single PCI high reading. None were associated with PCI increases in diastolic BP. There is no information if the increased respiratory rates and increased BP were associated with crying.  The most common PCI findings were prolongations of the QT corrected (QTc) interval, which occurred in 16 (12%) of 129 patients, including 11 patients with PCI QTc intervals at screening. Of the 11 patients with PCI QTc intervals at screening, 4 patients had no subsequent ECG reading, 2 patients had QTc intervals that remained elevated throughout the trial, and 5 patients had QTc intervals that returned below the PCI threshold at subsequent readings (2 patients while on treatment with placebo and 3 patients while on treatment with pantoprazole). In addition, 5 patients who did not have PCI findings at screening did have prolonged QTc intervals during the trial: 1 patient while on open-label pantoprazole, 2 patients at the end of treatment with doubleblind pantoprazole, and 2 patients at the end of treatment with double-blind placebo. These data show that prolonged QTc intervals were common in this patient population and provide no signal that treatment with pantoprazole leads to a prolongation of the QTc interval. Adult data do not show a concern for QT prolongation. appear to be a signal for QT prolongation, and other trials in older pediatric patients will be reviewed for any notable trends in the reported ECG results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Growth Parameter Analyses</head><p>The patients were monitored for changes in growth parameters.</p><p>Weight. Weight was measured at baseline, Week 2, Week 4, the final open-label assessment, Week 6, Week 8, and the final double-blind assessment. For patients in the safety population, mean weight increased from 7.0 kg at baseline to 7.5 kg at week 4 (p&lt;0.001). Mean weight increased in both treatment groups from baseline to Week 4 and from Week 4 to Week 8 (p&lt;0.001). At Week 8, the mean weight in both groups had increased by approximately 1 kg in both treatment groups. There were no statistically significant between-group differences in weight changes. In the safety population, the mean weight z-score was -0.38 at baseline and 0.32 at week 4 at the end of treatment with open-label pantoprazole, indicating that on average children in this trial were slightly below the norm for their peers and that their weight gains were in line with those expected without significant catch-up. Among patients completing the doubleblind phase, the mean z-scores for weight at Week 8 showed small but statistically significant (p=0.012 and p=0.017) gains in both treatment groups. There were no statistically significant between-group differences in height changes. The height z-score for the safety population was -0.49, as with weight, these infants were on average slightly less tall than their peers. After four weeks of open-label treatment with pantoprazole, there was no change in the z-score in height, indicating that the rate of growth in height over the four weeks was in line with the norm for the patients' peers. Among patients completing the doubleblind phase, the mean z-score for height at week 8 had increased from baseline by 0.42 (p=0.015) in the placebo group and 0.23 (p=0.077) in the pantoprazole 1.2-mg/kg group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Height</head><p>For patients in the safety population, mean head circumference increased (p&lt;0.001) by approximately 1 cm from 42.4 cm at baseline to 43.3 cm at Week 4. In patients completing the double-blind phase of the trial, head circumference increased (p&lt;0.001) from baseline to week 4 while on open-label pantoprazole in both treatment groups and increased (p&lt;0.001) by approximately 1.7 cm in both groups by Week 8. There were no statistically significant between-group differences in head circumference changes. At baseline, the mean z-score was 0.15 (±1.4) overall. Head circumference increased from baseline to Week 4. The within-group analyses of head circumference z-scores showed that patients in pantoprazole 1.2-mg/kg group had statistically significant growth from baseline to Week 4 (p&lt;0.001), and patients in both treatment groups had significant growth from baseline to Week 8 (p=0.012 in the pantoprazole 1.2-mg/kg group and p=0.001 in the placebo group).

No deaths occurred, and there was no pattern of AEs indicative of a treatment related effect. Eight patients had 11 SAEs throughout the screening, treatment, and follow-up phases of the trial; of those one case of diarrhea is thought to be possibly related to treatment and required discontinuation from the trial. The most common TEAE was upper respiratory infection, which occurred with equal frequency in the two treatment groups. The most common TEAEs that occurred more frequently in the treated group during the double-blind period as compared to placebo were: otitis media, vomiting, fever, and CPK elevation. Five patients were withdrawn from the trial because of AEs, four during the open-label phase and one during the double-blind phase. Laboratory test results did not reveal any discernable treatment-related abnormalities.</p><p>There are no major safety signals that have been identified in this trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>The clinical outcome trial did not meet its primary endpoint. Assessment of symptoms was by parent observation and we may not be capturing the most relevant aspects to best detect effectiveness of treatment.</p><p>Sensitivity and specificity of the assessment tool used is questionable (Section 6.1.4) and further research is warranted to improve capture of data for studying GERD in this young patient population. Although there were no major safety signals detected from review of the safety data, use of pantoprazole treatment without supportive clinical outcome is unwarranted. Trial 3001B3-328 (Trial 328) is a Phase 3, multicenter, outpatient, randomized, double-blind trial of the clinical outcomes, safety, and tolerability of multiple doses of pantoprazole sodium enteric-coated granules in children, ages 1 to 5 years, with endoscopically proven symptomatic GERD.</p><p>The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of treatment with three doses of oral pantoprazole (low, medium, and high) in patient ages 1 to 5 years with endoscopically-proven GERD. The dosages of pantoprazole selected in this trial were selected as the dosages considered to be therapeutically effective and safe based on the results obtained from trial 3001B3-334-US (Section 9.4.7). Secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and growth parameters of oral pantoprazole in these patients.</p><p>Trial period: <ref type="bibr">May 11, 2006</ref><ref type="bibr">to April 29, 2008</ref> The trial was conducted at 26 sites in North America.

Background</head><p>Protocol Amendments There were a total of three amendments that were made to the protocol, two of which were made prior to patient entry into the trials. Amendment 3 is described in detail: <ref type="bibr">Amendment 3 (Feb 22, 2007)</ref> reflected a change in the inclusion/exclusion criteria. "Neurologically impaired patients with endoscopically-confirmed EE" were removed from the inclusion criteria. "Severely neurologically impaired patients with NERD" was added to the exclusion criteria. In the exclusion criteria, "severely neurologically impaired patients with EE may be enrolled at lower weights with prior Wyeth medical monitor approval" was added. In the prohibited treatment, "except in severely neurologically impaired patients with EE" was added to "carbamazepine or phenytoin." Under efficacy, "For patients with EE" was added to the weekly GERD symptom score and the change from baseline was summarized in a separate analysis. Ability to take apple juice was added to the inclusion criteria and to the test article preparation and administration section. A history of treatment with PPIs within 14 days of endoscopy prior to randomization was added to the exclusion criteria and "administration of GSQ-YC" was removed. Previously failed adequately dosed and administered PPI with adequate duration of treatment was added to the exclusion criteria. The endoscopy prior to randomization was added.</p><p>The sample size was based on regulatory and practical needs not set by statistical power.

The following note was added to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, "a decreased score, (exclusionary score &lt;3) may be obtained from patients who have not been washed out of PPIs/H2RAs." If this occurs, the patient should be washed out of the PPI/H2RA therapy over a period of 14 days, and then the questionnaire should be re-administered. If the patient does not obtain a score of &gt;3, the patient is considered a screen failure. The PPIs, H2RAs, prokinetic agents, and antacids prohibited periods were changed by removing the 14 days before screening questionnaire.</p></div>

Patients randomized to the high-dose group were assigned to the 15-mg or 20-mg dose group based on their age to better approximate 1.2 mg/kg as shown in the following figure. The pantoprazole sodium spheroids were sprinkled on a teaspoon of applesauce or in apple juice and orally administered within two hours after preparation, and at least a half hour before breakfast. The patient was allowed additional water or apple juice up to a maximum of four ounces (120 mL), which included the amount used for preparation and rinses. Patients who did not like the taste or texture of applesauce were permitted to sprinkle the spheroids into a teaspoon of apple juice. Only applesauce or apple juice was given to administer the pantoprazole spheroids.</p></div>

The investigator provided dosage directions (e.g., ½ standard teaspoon, 4 to 6 times per day, not to exceed 35 mg/kg/day or 87.5 mg CaHCO 3 /kg/day). Children weighing over 25 kg were permitted to receive a maximum of one teaspoon, four to six times per day.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Determination of Sample Size</head><p>Sample size was based on regulatory and practical needs, and was not set by statistical power. However, the Applicant states that the sample size was large enough to evaluate the safety, tolerability and relative effectiveness of three doses of pantoprazole based on the results of a similar trial, 3001A1-322-US. Approximately 100 NERD patients were enrolled in this trial to ensure at least 42 patients completing the trial. Once a sufficient number of patients (about 42) without EE completed the trial, only patients with EE were enrolled until at least four of these patients completed the trial. However, if after four months of time elapsed following the last NERD patient completed the trial, and no additional EE patients were randomized, the trial was closed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effectiveness Parameters -Statistical method for effectiveness endpoints</head><p>The changes in weekly GERD symptom score from baseline to Week 8 were analyzed for between-group comparison by an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) that included treatment group and age cohort (&lt;2 years old, ≥2 years old) as factors, and baseline GERD symptom frequency score and baseline antacid use as covariates. If the effect of the treatment group was significant, pairwise contrasts were used to further explore differences among the dose groups. The changes from baseline to other trial weeks were analyzed similarly. In addition, summary statistics for the weekly GERD symptom scores and the change from baseline were also reported by treatment group and trial week. Paired t-tests were was for the within-group comparison in changes from baseline.</p><p>For each individual GERD symptom frequency and respiratory symptom scores and the average daily amount of antacid used, similar analyses were performed and reported. The number of patients with healing of EE was compared among treatment groups by using Fisher's exact tests. For patients with EE, the weekly GERD symptom score and the change from baseline were summarized. To assess the consistency of the age-based dose strength assignment schedule with the randomized treatment groups, a weight-adjusted treatment group was assigned based on the actual dose level that was defined as the actual dose amount (mg) that a patient received divided by the patient baseline weight (kg). The change of WGSS from baseline to the final week was re-analyzed using an ANCOVA model with the weight-adjusted treatment group and baseline age group as fixed factors and baseline WGSS score and baseline antacid amount as covariates.</p></div>

Discrete safety parameters were analyzed by using either the Fisher exact test or the chi-square test. Growth parameters (weight, height/length, and their z-scores) were summarized. The changes in growth parameters from baseline were compared by an ANCOVA with the baseline as covariate and baseline age group and treatment as factors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of patients</head><p>A total of 101 patients were screened at 26 investigational sites for the trial. Of these, 41 patients were screen failures. The remaining 60 patients (56 NERD and 4 EE patients) were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment groups and received at least one dose of test article; the safety population and the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population were the same. Within the mITT population in this trial, 47 patients were included in the valid-for-evaluation (VFE) population. A summary of the patient disposition by analysis population and treatment groups is provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 43</ref> from the Applicant. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discontinuations</head><p>Of the 60 patients included in the safety population, 53 (88%) patients completed all aspects of treatment during the trial. Of the 7 (12%) patients who discontinued from the trial, 4 (7%) patients withdrew due to AEs, which was the most common reason for discontinuation (328-036 000872 [contact dermatitis and diarrhea]; 328-042-000332 [rectal hemorrhage]; 328-046-000213 [sleep disorder]; and 328-057-000547 [abdominal pain]). Two (3%) patients withdrew due to parent request (328-005-000843 and 328-060-000962), and 1 (2%) patient (328-078-001321) was withdrawn from the trial at the request of the Applicant due to protocol violation (medication error). Protocol Deviations and Compliance There were seven patients, half of which belong in the high dose group, with protocol deviations as described in the following table from the Applicant's submission. There were no statistically significant differences among the dose groups in mean compliance during treatment.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concomitant Medications</head><p>Non-trial concomitant medications usage was reported by 95% of the safety population and this was equally distributed in each of the trial treatment groups. The usage of non-trial concomitant medications by &gt;10% of the safety population, excluding the antacids classification, is presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_23">Table 8</ref>-5. The most common non-trial concomitant medications reported by &gt;10% of the safety population were: paracetamol (n = 24, 40%), ibuprofen, and amoxicillin (n = 11, 18%, each), multivitamins (n = 10, 17%), and cetirizine (n = 9, 15%). Statistically significant (p = 0.041) differences between treatment groups was noted for the usage of Miralax in the safety population.</p><p>Comment: There appears to be a dose dependent correlation between treatment and Miralax use. Constipation is not a known adverse reaction to PPIs. This may need to be further evaluated if there are similar patterns across other trials.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effectiveness Evaluation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary Effectiveness</head><p>The primary effectiveness analysis was the change in mean WGSS from baseline week to final week for the mITT NERD population. A bar graph of the mean (with ±1 standard error) WGSS for the mITT population at baseline and final week for patients with NERD is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref> from the Applicant. The WGSS mean scores at baseline were 3.2, 2.4, and 3.4 for the low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively. By the final week the mean scores had decreased to 0.8, 1.8, and 1.7 for the low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively, indicating improvement in symptoms for all the dose groups. The low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups included 0, 4, and 2 patients, respectively, who had baseline WGSS &lt; 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 15: WGSS at Baseline and Final Week for All Doses (Trial 328)</head><p>Clinical Review Ii-Lun Chen, M.D. sNDA 22-020/20-987 Protonix for Delayed-Release Oral Suspension/Protonix Delayed-Release <ref type="table">Tablet (pantoprazole sodium)</ref> Descriptive statistics and within-treatment comparisons of WGSS for the mITT population (last observation carried forward, LOCF) for patients with NERD is presented below. For the mITT population, there were statistically significant within-group decreases in the mean WGSS from baseline to final week for the high-dose (p &lt; 0.001) and the low-dose (p &lt; 0.001) groups, but the decrease was not significant for the medium-dose group (p = 0.06).   final week was nominally statistically significant for all three dose groups. The largest decreases from baseline to final week in the numbers of patients reporting symptoms were observed for choking/gagging, refusal to eat, and difficulty swallowing; the decreases were observed in all three dose groups. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary Effectiveness Endpoint EE Patients</head><p>There were four patients who had a diagnosis of EE: two in the medium-dose group and two in the high-dose group (patients with EE could not be randomized to the low-dose group). Repeat endoscopy demonstrated that all of the EE patients were healed at the final week of trial. From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref>, the weight based dosing was calculated showing that all patients with EE received a dose that is approximately 1 mg/kg pantoprazole regardless of the dosing group to which they were assigned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects on Antacid Use</head><p>The mean amount of antacid (mL) taken weekly decreased from baseline week to week 8 by 28.3 in the low-dose group (p = 0.037), 9.6 in the medium-dose group (p = 0.069), and 8.60 in the high-dose group (p = 0.181). The changes from baseline in the amount of antacid taken weekly are summarized for the mITT NERD population from the baseline week through trial week 8 are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 53</ref>: Comparison of Study Antacid Used in mL(Trial 328) from the Applicant. For the mITT NERD population, there were no statistically significant between-group differences in the mean change from baseline week to Week 8 (or any other time point) in the amount of antacid taken weekly as shown below.</p><p>Comment: There is a difference in mean amount of antacid used in the low dose group as compared to the medium and high dose groups. It also appears that there is a much larger SD and range for the low dose group. Therefore, it is most likely that one patient is off-setting the values for this group and that overall there is no significant decrease in the use of antacid taken weekly. However, there does appear to be a trend towards decreased usage of antacid by Week 8. The clinical meaningfulness of this decrease from approximately 4 tablespoons of antacid to 2 tablespoons per week is unknown. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of Respiratory Symptom Improvement</head><p>The frequency of a cold or fever was fairly constant throughout the trial, with little difference between dose groups. The frequency of cough without a cold decreased from baseline to final visit but was only statistically significant in the low-dose group. Noisy breathing also decreased significantly in the low and high-dose groups. There was no significant change in the other respiratory symptoms between baseline and the final week of trial. The number of patients reporting respiratory symptoms (questionnaire items 6b through 6g) from baseline to final week decreased in all three dose groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effectiveness Conclusions</head><p>For the mITT NERD population, the mean WGSS decreased from baseline to the final week in the low-dose and high-dose treatment groups. The medium-dose group had more patients in the younger age group, more male patients, and lower mean GSQ-YC scores at screening. An additional ad hoc analysis showed that the weight-adjusted treatment groups were consistent with the randomized treatment groups for most of the patients. However, there was some shift between the dose groups when the doses were adjusted for weight. This was evident in the lowdose and medium-dose groups.</p><p>Weekly mean frequency scores for individual symptoms decreased from baseline to the final week in all the dose groups. The decreases in the medium-dose group were less than in the lowdose and high-dose groups. The between-group comparisons showed no statistically significant differences. The frequency of a cold or fever was fairly constant throughout the trial, with little difference between dose groups. Decreases in other individual respiratory symptoms from baseline to the final week were observed in all dose groups, although the decreases were not statistically significant. The between-group comparisons showed no statistically significant differences.</p><p>All four patients with EE, who were treated with either medium (0.6 mg/kg) or high (1.2 mg/kg) doses of pantoprazole, were healed at eight weeks. In this trial, only patients with EE had a repeat endoscopy at the end of treatment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exposure</head><p>More than 88% of patients received 43-49 days of treatment with pantoprazole and &gt;78% of patients received ≥ 50 days of treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Serious Adverse Events</head><p>No deaths were reported.</p><p>Two (2, 3%) patients had a total of three SAEs at some time during treatment in this trial. None of these SAEs was considered to be related to the trial drug. Two SAEs were of mild severity; one SAE was of moderate severity. The SAEs experienced by these two patients were abdominal pain (328-057-000547), and anorexia and dehydration (328-077-001261).</p><p>Patient 328-057-000547 was a three-year old white male with GERD whose medical history included, left ear infection, abdominal pain, thrush, yeast infection, asthma and mild cerebral palsy all of which were continuing at the time of trial entry. Prior to trial entry the patient was receiving ranitidine for the treatment of GERD which was stopped on Jan 15, 2008. At trial entry the patient was receiving Tylenol, levalbuterol, phenylephrine/chlorpheniramine, amoxicillin/clavulanate, xopenex and nystatin.

The patient was randomized on Feb 15, 2008 [pantoprazole 10mg] and received the first dose on this date. On 2008, days after starting trial medication, the patient experienced abdominal pain. The test article was discontinued that day. The principal investigator referred the child to the hospital with abdominal pain, diarrhea and dehydration the next day. An abdominal x-ray was normal. No additional tests were performed and the patient was sent home. On 2008, the patient was admitted to a different hospital. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, CBC, BMP, amylase, CRP, ESR, urinalysis were all negative. The patient was treated with IV fluids and was discharged , 2008. The investigator reported the cause of the abdominal pain and diarrhea was unknown and considered the events to be not related to trial medication. On March 13, 2008, the patient was started on Prevacid 15 mg daily. Abdominal pain remains on going and the patient was continuing to be followed by the principal investigator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comment: Given the timing of the abdominal pain, it is possible that the test drug could have had a contributory role in the patient's abdominal pain. However, as the patient has a baseline history of abdominal pain and continued to have abdominal pain more than seven weeks after the test drug was discontinued despite extensive medical evaluation, it is less likely that the patient's SAE was a direct effect of pantoprazole.</head><p>Patient 328-077-001261 was a 1-year-old-white female with GERD, whose medical history included cortical dysplasia, chronic constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, and enlarged tonsils, all of which were ongoing at trial entry. On trial Day 36, the patient underwent an elective adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy, which was planned prior to trial entry, and partial removal of an ingrown toenail. The patient's postoperative oral intake was inadequate, and required IV fluids which prolonged her hospitalization. By postoperative day 4, the patient's oral intake increased and the patient was discharged. The investigator considered that the poor postoperative oral intake was not related to treatment with the trial medication. Two days after discharge, the patient developed a temperature of 101.7°F, irritability, and refused food and liquids. The following day (trial day 43), the patient was readmitted to the hospital because of dehydration. The patient was treated with IV fluids and antibiotics for a toenail infection at the operative site. The patient's oral intake improved over a 24 hour period, and she was discharged the next day (trial day 44). The investigator considered the event of dehydration to be not related to treatment with the test article. The patient completed the trial.</p><p>Comment: I agree with the investigator that in this situation, the test drug is unlikely to be related to the SAE of anorexia and dehydration, but rather that these events were secondary to the elective surgeries performed.</p><p>Adverse Events AEs were reported by 57 (95%) of 60 patients in the safety population. The most common AEs reported by body system were as follows: respiratory system (43; 72%), body as a whole (32; 53%), and digestive system (29; 48%). TEAEs were reported in 55 (92%) of 60 patients in the safety population, 18 of 18 (100%), 19 of 21 (91%), and 18 of 21 (86%) of patients receiving low-dose, medium-dose and high-dose pantoprazole, respectively. Specific TEAEs reported in three or more patients (≥5%) by body system and event were as follows: body as a whole -fever 110 Clinical Review Ii-Lun Chen, M.D. sNDA 22-020/20-987 Protonix for Delayed-Release Oral Suspension/Protonix Delayed-Release Tablet (pantoprazole sodium) (11, 18%), accidental injury and headache (8, 13%, each), and abdominal pain <ref type="bibr">(5, 8%)</ref>; digestive system -diarrhea and vomiting, (9, 15%, each), and gastroenteritis (4, 7%); heme and lymphatic system -lymphadenopathy <ref type="bibr">(5, 8%)</ref> and ecchymosis (4, 7%); respiratory system -URI (23, 38%), rhinitis (9, 15%), cough increased (7, 12%), pharyngitis <ref type="bibr">(5, 8%)</ref>, and sinusitis <ref type="bibr">(3, 5%)</ref>.

In addition, this patient (328-029 000123) had a TEAE of accidental injury (fell and hit head and abrasions on cheek), and also had low normal platelet counts at all evaluations, including screening (187 x 109/L), Week 4 (150 x 109/L), and week 8 (184 x109/L). Fifty-five (92%) of 60 patients in the safety population had at least one TEAE. Overall, 11 (18%) patients had 14 TEAEs that were considered related to trial drug by investigators.</p><p>TEAEs considered by investigators to be related to trial medication were: headache (3 patients), diarrhea <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(2)</ref>, and gastroenteritis, hyperlipidemia, sleep disorder, hyperkinesia, epistaxis, URI, maculopapular rash, lab test abnormal (elevated gastrin), and urticaria (1 patient, each). TEAEs were assessed by the investigator as being of mild severity in 46 patients, and moderate severity in 9 patients. No TEAEs were categorized by investigators as severe.  Patient 328-036-000872 was a two year old white male whose medical history, in addition to GERD, included penicillin allergy and diarrhea. On trial day 16, the patient, who received pantoprazole 5 mg daily, developed diarrhea and contact diaper dermatitis. Treatment with the trial drug was discontinued seven days later (23 days after initiation), and trial participation concluded on trial Day 48 due to these AEs. The investigator considered that the diarrhea was related to the trial drug, and the contact diaper dermatitis was not related to trial treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comment: Diarrhea is a possible side effect of treatment and diaper dermatitis is likely secondary to the diarrhea.</head><p>Patient 328-042-000332 was a three year old white male who received pantoprazole 20 mg. On trial day 24, the patient developed rectal bleeding. Treatment with the trial drug was withdrawn on trial day 25, and the trial participation was concluded on <ref type="bibr">Oct 2, 2006 (trial Day 33)</ref> due to the AE of rectal bleeding. The rectal bleeding was considered not related to the trial drug by the investigator.</p><p>Comment: Given the timing of the AE and lack of further description on the potential other cause for rectal bleeding by the investigator in the CRF, I am unable to evaluate the relationship of the AE to the trial drug. There remains a possibility that there is a correlation.</p><p>Patient 328-046-000213 was a one year old white male whose medical history, in addition to GERD, included chronic congestion, penile adhesions, otitis media, and eczema. Twelve days prior to initiation of therapy with pantoprazole 10 mg daily, treatment with nasal triamcinolone, which the patient received for the treatment of snoring, was discontinued. The patient with the PCI short PR interval (328-057-000543) had the abnormality both at screening and on treatment.</p><p>Per protocol, all ECGs were read and were assessed overall by the investigator or a consultant as "normal", showing a "nonclinically significant abnormality" or showing a "clinically significant abnormality." Only one patient's (328-008-000902) ECGs were assessed as showing a clinically significant abnormality. At both the screening and final evaluations, this patient's ECG showed a primary RSR pattern of the QRS complex in leads V1, V2 and V3. On the posttrial follow-up evaluation for this abnormality, the patient was found to have a bicuspid aortic valve.</p><p>There were no significant within-group or between-group differences in ECG parameters during the trial for the safety population. There were no abnormal QTc changes reported in this trial.</p><p>Comment: Overall, there is no notable concern for changes in ECG due to pantoprazole treatment.</p><p>Vital Signs A total of 6 (10%) patients had PCI vital sign readings. One patient (328-009-000007) had a PCI high systolic blood pressure measurement (&gt;140 mm Hg) at screening and also at Week 2 of treatment, but non-PCI measurements at all subsequent visits. Two patients (328-045-000184 and 328-043-000423) had a PCI low systolic blood pressure measurement at screening. No other PCI systolic blood pressure measurements were noted at subsequent visits for these patients. One  The most common PCI laboratory test abnormalities occurring during the trial were urinary leukocyte esterase levels, which occurred in 4 of 59 (7%) patients, serum gastrin levels in 3 of 60 (5%) patients, serum triglyceride levels in 2 of 59 (3%) patients, serum phosphorous levels in 2 of 60 (3%) patients, white blood cell (WBC) count in 2 of 60 (3%) patients, and platelet count 2 of 60 (3%) patients.</p><p>Patient (328-042-000331) had a PCI elevated creatinine level. This patient was a 4-year-old male with asthma on concomitant medications of mometasone, fluticasone, and salmeterol. The patient was randomly assigned to the low-dose treatment group (0.3 mg/kg). At screening, he had a high-normal serum creatinine of 44 μmol/L (reference range: 18-44 μmol/L) with a normal blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 11.0 mg/dL (reference range: 4-24 mg/dL). At the trial Week 4 visit (trial day 31), the serum creatinine value was PCI high (&gt;88.4 μmol/L) at 318 μmol/L, with a non-PCI high BUN of 37 mg/dL. On repeat evaluation at a different laboratory two days later, the serum creatinine had returned to the baseline level of 44 μmol/L (reference range: 18.0-88.0 μmol/L) other blood chemistry parameters were not assessed at that time. At Week 8, the serum creatinine level, assessed by the original laboratory, was slightly elevated at 53 μmol/L (reference range: 18.0-44.0 μmol/L) and the BUN was normal at 13 mg/dL (reference range: 4.0 24.0 mg/dL); the phosphorous, magnesium, calcium, and uric acid levels had all returned to normal. The patient had no associated clinical AEs, no renal-pertinent medical history, and completed his allocated course of trial medication.</p><p>Comment: There appears to be a real event underlying the change in BUN and Cr values, however, the relationship with drug treatment is uncertain. A patient (328-046-000214) had a PCI elevated CPK level. This 1-year-old female was in the low-dose treatment group (0.3 mg/kg) and had an extensive medical history including low weight and intermittent abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). The patient had a normal CPK level of 99 mU/mL (reference range: 18-134 mU/mL) at screening. At the Week 6 visit (trial day 39), the CPK level was PCI high (&gt;402 mU/mL) at 1589 mU/mL. On repeat testing at a different laboratory five days later, the CPK level had decreased substantially to a non-PCI elevated level of 153 mU/mL (reference range: 0-100.0 mU/mL). Apart from some swelling of the fingers which was noted on the day the repeat blood work was obtained, and which resolved the following day, the patient had no temporally associated AEs. At the final evaluation on trial day 67, the patient's CPK level, measured by the original lab, was normal at 113 mU/mL (reference range: 18.0-134.0 mU/mL).</p><p>Two patients had PCI phosphorus levels. Patient 328-045-000182, who had Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (pseudohypoparathyroidism) and hypothyroidism, had PCI high phosphorus levels at screening and Week 8, and a non-PCI high phosphorus at Week 4. This patient also had non-PCI high magnesium levels at all evaluations, and non-PCI low or lownormal calcium levels at all evaluations. Hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia are features of Albright's osteodystrophy. This patient also had PCI high (&gt;3.39) fasting triglyceride levels of 3.41 mmol/L at Week 8; at screening the fasting triglyceride levels had been non-PCI elevated at 1.31 (0.4-1.24mmol/L); the blood sample at Week 4 was nonfasting. The other patient (328-042 000331) with PCI high phosphorus levels also had a PCI elevated creatinine level and is described above.</p><p>Two patients had PCI high fasting triglyceride levels. Patient 328-045-000182, who also had a PCI phosphorus level, is described above. Patient 328-057-000542, who had no screening blood chemistry results, had a PCI high (&gt; 3.39mmol/L) fasting triglyceride level of 4.30 mmol/L at the Week 4 evaluation. The fasting triglyceride levels were non-PCI elevated at 2.20 mmol/L (reference range: 0.4-1.24 mmol/L) at Week 6, and normal at 0.9 mmol/L at week 8. The patient's fasting cholesterol levels were normal at all assessments. This patient was noted to have unexplained hepatosplenomegaly at trial entry.</p><p>Three patients had PCI high fasting gastrin levels at Week 8, all having had normal levels at screening. One patient (328-009-000005) had discontinued treatment with lansoprazole 16 days prior to the start of trial medication and one patient (328-008-000906) had discontinued treatment with ranitidine 18 days prior to the start of trial medication. The other patient (328 102-000692) was not receiving any PPI or H2RA prior to trial entry. Statistically significant increases in fasting gastrin levels, from baseline to Week 8, were seen in the two higher dose groups.</p><p>All four patients who had PCI hematology test results (1 patient with a PCI-low WBC count, 1 patient with a PCI-elevated WBC and a PC-elevated lymphocyte count, and 2 patients with elevated platelet counts) had the PCI abnormalities only at screening, and had normal or improved hematology test values at subsequent assessments.</p></div>

In one patient, the leukocyte esterase remained positive at Week 4, but was negative at Week 8. In all the other patients, the PCI abnormality was seen only at screening.</p><p>Comment: Review of the CRFs for the above cases indicate that it is likely that only the elevated gastrin and triglyceride levels are associated with trial drug administration. For the other PCI laboratory results, these returned to within normal range by end of trial while on treatment, therefore making it less likely that the treatment was the cause for the abnormalities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Growth</head><p>Patients were monitored for changes in growth parameters (weight, height, weight z-score, and height z-score) by trial week. Changes in actual weight (kg) at baseline and the final trial visit assessment for the treatment groups in the safety/mITT population are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">Table 57</ref> from the sponsor. For patients in the safety population, mean weight significantly increased from baseline through the final visit assessment for all trial treatment groups. There were no significant between-group differences in mean changes from baseline in actual weight for patients in the safety population. In the safety population with NERD and EE patients combined, mean weight z-score at final visit increased by 0.1 in the low-dose group, by 0.12 in the mediumdose group, and by 0.03 in the high-dose group. Between-group differences in weight z-score were not statistically significant. Height was measured at baseline, Week 8, and during the final visit assessment. For patients in the safety population, the mean actual height increased significantly from baseline to Week 8, and also to the final trial visit assessment for all treatment groups. Changes in actual height (cm) from baseline to the final assessment for the safety population are summarized in  Comment: Overall, short term treatment with the trial drug does not appear to hinder growth in these pediatric patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Conclusions</head><p>In this trial, daily treatment with pantoprazole at doses of 0.3 mg/kg, 0.6 mg/kg, and 1.2 mg/kg was tolerated in patients aged 1 through 5 years with endoscopically-proven symptomatic GERD. No major safety issues were identified. There were no deaths. Two patients had SAEs, neither of which was considered by the investigator to be related to treatment with the trial medication, this conclusion seems reasonable given the case histories. Four patients were withdrawn from the trial because of AEs. Two of which were considered related to trial drug: diarrhea in one patient and an unspecified sleep disorder in the other patient.</p><p>While TEAEs were reported in most patients, they were events commonly occurring in this age group: respiratory infections, minor accidental injuries, and gastrointestinal effects. None showed a dose-related pattern suggestive of a drug effect.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. General Design and Objective</head><p>Trial 3001A1-322-US (Trial 322) is a Phase 3, multi-center, out-patient, randomized, doubleblind trial of the safety, tolerability, and clinical outcomes of multiple doses (10, 20, and 40 mg) of oral pantoprazole in children (5 to 11 yrs old) with endoscopically proven GERD.</p><p>All trials were completed in the US, 12 centers participated. The trial period was from <ref type="bibr">Dec 2, 2002</ref><ref type="bibr">, through Dec 23, 2003</ref>. A total of 52 patients completed the trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Background</head><p>As stated in the Written Request for Pediatric trials with pantoprazole sodium (originally issued on <ref type="bibr">Dec 31, 2001</ref><ref type="bibr">, amended on Dec 18, 2002</ref><ref type="bibr">Jul 28, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">May 7, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">and 15 May 2006)</ref>, the objectives for Trial 4 in children, aged 1-11 years, included:</p><p>1. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of single and repeated doses of pantoprazole sodium in patients 1 to 11 years of age. 2. To compare the safety and clinical outcome of pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age with endoscopically proven GERD across different dosages of pantoprazole sodium. 3. To determine the proportion of patients showing endoscopic evidence of healing after completion of therapy across different dosages of pantoprazole sodium in those pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age who undergo follow-up endoscopy after treatment.</p><p>To satisfy objectives 2 and 3, Wyeth conducted two safety and effectiveness trials (322 and 328) to evaluate the clinical outcome of different dosages of pantoprazole sodium in pediatric patients aged 1 to 11 years with endoscopically proven GERD. Trial 322 was designed to evaluate the safety and clinical outcomes of treatment with oral pantoprazole (10, 20, and 40 mg) in pediatric patients (5 to 11 years old) with symptomatic GERD. For the Written Request, all patients were required to have endoscopically proven GERD.</p><p>To fulfill objective 1, Wyeth conducted five pharmacokinetic trials (3001A1-109-US, 3001K1 110-US, 3001K1-117-US, 3001A1-337-US and 3001B3-334-US) to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of single and repeated doses of pantoprazole sodium. Dosages (pantoprazole 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg) for each patient were selected because the Applicant felt these dosages were most likely to be therapeutically effective and safe based on pediatric and adult PK data. In a phase 1 pediatric trial (3001A1-109-US), the PK and safety profile of a single oral dose of pantoprazole tablet 20 or 40 mg were evaluated in children aged 5 to 10 years old and 11 to 16 years old who could benefit from acid-suppressive therapy. Pharmacokinetic data from 3001A1-109-US showed dose proportionality and similarity between the 5-to 10 years old and 11-to 16-years old age groups, with serum values similar to those from historical data obtained in adults. No significant association was observed between either clearance or t 1/2 and age or weight. The volume of distribution increased with age and weight. Pharmacokinetics results were also evaluated from an open-label, single-dose, randomized, parallel group trial, 3001K1-110-US, in hospitalized patients aged 2 to 16 years who could benefit from acid suppression therapy. Patients were stratified into three groups according to age (2 to 4, 5 to 10, and 11 to 16 years) and then randomly assigned to receive one of the following treatments: 1) pantoprazole IV 0.8 mg/kg infused over 15 minutes, and 2) pantoprazole IV 1.6 mg/kg infused over 15 minutes.</p><p>The Applicant states that the PK results with IV pantoprazole, in children aged 2 to 16 years from trial 3001K1-110 showed that the dose-independent PK parameters CL and t 1/2 are similar to the historical data observed in adult subjects. Similar conclusions were obtained with the oral formulation of pantoprazole in the pediatric trial 3001A1-109. In conclusion, based on the results of trial 3001A1-109 and trial 3001K1-110, doses of pantoprazole 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg were selected.</p><p>The assessment tool, GASP-Q, was tested in an unpublished field test conducted by Wyeth in 77 children aged 5 to 16 years. Of the 77 patients, 38 were 5 to 10 years old; 47 of the children were diagnosed as having GERD. Overall, the children with GERD had a mean symptom score of 69.2 (SD = 65.0; min -max = 0-233). In the 5 to 10-year-old group, 14 children without GERD had a mean CSS of 31.6 (SD=62.4) while 23 children with GERD had a mean symptom of 60.9 (SD=43.8).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol Amendments</head><p>The original protocol, dated <ref type="bibr">Jul 3, 2002</ref>, was amended once on Jan 17, 2003. The amendment was submitted to the FDA on <ref type="bibr">Feb 21, 2003 (IND 35,441, Serial No. 349</ref>) and included the following modifications: 1. The number of potential sites increased to 25. 2. Exclusion Criterion 12 regarding the history of PPI treatment was modified to allow screening of subjects with a PPI usage three months before administration of the test article. 3. Some editorial changes not affecting the conduct of the trial were implemented. 4. It was indicated that all central lab and biopsy results should be recorded on the CRF using an electronic system. 5. The protocol's administrative sections 7 (Selection of Patients), 8 (Trial Material), and 9 (Trial Methods) were revised to include additional information regarding records and reports, publications, and subject injury.</p></div>

Weight and height greater than tenth percentile for the patient's age. 7. Female patients who had the onset of menses:</p><p>i. were required to have a negative urine b-HCG test result before receiving test article; ii. And if sexually active, were required to use medically acceptable contraception, and were required to sign an IRB-approved child assent form, which reflected an awareness of the stipulations concerning the use of contraception in sexually active female patients and the use of medically acceptable contraception (including oral contraception, injectable or implantable methods, and intrauterine devices).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Procedure</head><p>Patients received the trial drug once daily for eight weeks. Visits occurred at Weeks -2, 2, 4, 6, and 8 and telephone contacts were conducted at Weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7. The post treatment telephone contact occurred approximately two weeks after the final visit. A symptom questionnaire, GERD Assessment of Symptoms in Pediatrics Questionnaire (GASP-Q), was used to evaluate response. As a measure of patient well being, Composite Symptom Score (CSS) was determined on the basis of the frequency and severity of eight selected symptoms. Results of endoscopy with biopsy at week eight were compared with the baseline results.</p><p>During the pretrial screening period, an endoscopy was required to diagnose GERD and to rule out upper gastrointestinal pathology other than GERD. To confirm a diagnosis of GERD, each patient was to have either positive endoscopic evidence of reflux-related esophagitis within two weeks before enrollment (per modified Hetzel-Dent score ≥ grade 2 and/or presence of vertical lines) or positive histologic evidence of esophagitis consistent with GERD within two weeks before enrollment.</p><p>The modified Hetzel-Dent score was to be obtained before conducting the esophageal biopsies or passing the endoscope beyond the lower esophageal sphincter. The Hetzel-Dent score below was modified for use in children to include the distal 15% of the esophagus (instead of the distal five cm of the esophagus used in adults): Six biopsy samples were taken from the patient's esophagus: 1. Four biopsies from the distal esophagus (2 to 3 cm above the Z line; one biopsy circumferentially from each quadrant position at approximately 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Two biopsies from the mid-esophagus (at approximately 0°and 180°) GERD biopsies</head><p>were analyzed for GERD-associated esophagitis by the central laboratory.</p><p>Basal cell height, papillary height, total mucosal height, eosinophils per HPF, and neutrophils per HPF were measured. From the biopsy data a non-erosive GERD (NERD) score was determined as follows:</p><p>Grade 1 (mild) -1. Basal cell zone &gt; 15% of total mucosal height, or 2. Papillary height &gt; 66% of mucosal height. Grade 2 (moderate or severe), requires at least two of the following:</p><p>1. Basal cell zone &gt; 15% of total mucosal height; 2. Papillary height &gt; 66% of mucosal height; 3. Five eosinophils/HPF or ≥ three neutrophils/HPF. Grade 0 (normal esophagus): neither grade 1 or 2.</p><p>Endoscopy and biopsies were performed at the final visit (visit 6 or week 8) for all patients with pathology at baseline. Endoscopy with biopsy at the final visit (visit 6) was optional for the pHmetry patients if their baseline results were normal. If GERD was confirmed on the basis of pH-metry, then a repeat evaluation was to be performed at the final visit. However, no patients were enrolled under this criterion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatments</head><p>Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of the following treatment regimens once daily for eight weeks: pantoprazole 10, 20, or 40 mg enteric-coated tablet. Each enrolled patient was to participate in the trial for approximately 12 weeks, including a two week screening period, an eight week treatment period, and a two week post treatment follow-up telephone contact. Visits occurred at weeks -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 and telephone contacts were conducted at weeks 1, <ref type="bibr">3, 5, and 7. 122</ref> Clinical Review Ii-Lun Chen, M.D. sNDA 22-020/20-987 Protonix for Delayed-Release Oral Suspension/Protonix Delayed-Release Tablet (pantoprazole sodium) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concomitant Medications</head><p>Trial antacid was provided during the pretrial and treatment periods for symptom relief. Patients were given Children's Mylanta Chewable Tablets (Johnson and Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ /Merck, West Point, PA; 400 mg calcium carbonate per tablet) for use after five or more minutes of GERD symptoms. All trial antacid given during the pretrial and treatment period had to be recorded on the patient's CRF, including the dose, the frequency, and the duration of treatment.</p><p>Patients continued with their usual medical therapies according to standard clinical practice unless prohibited. Continuous treatment with theophylline derivatives, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and digoxin was closely monitored throughout the trial to assure that proper serum levels of these drugs were maintained.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary Effectiveness Variables</head><p>The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of treatment with oral pantoprazole (10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg once daily) in patients aged 5 to 11 years with symptomatic GERD.</p><p>The primary endpoint is the change in the CSS from the baseline to the final visit. The individual symptom score (ISS) and the CSS were calculated for each assessment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary Effectiveness Variables</head><p>The secondary objective of this trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral pantoprazole (10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg once daily) in patients aged 5 to 11 years with symptomatic GERD.</p><p>The secondary endpoints were:</p><p>i. Change in ISS from baseline at each assessment and the change in CSS from baseline at each assessment (other than the final visit, which constituted the primary endpoint). ii. Need for trial antacids, as determined by a pill count at each visit. iii. Physician global assessment at the final visit. The physician global assessment was performed at the final visit. The physician global assessment is a seven-point Likert scale of the overall impression of the effectiveness of the test drug. Other endpoints:</p><p>iv. The number of times (frequency) each symptom occurred during the previous seven days, and each symptom's usual severity at each assessment. v. Endoscopy and histologic assessment of esophageal biopsies for patients with pathology results at baseline and after treatment, when available, to determine the proportion of patients showing endoscopic evidence of healing after completion of therapy across different dosages of pantoprazole sodium in those pediatric patients 5 to 11 years of age who underwent follow-up endoscopy after treatment. vi. Changes in growth parameters (i.e., weight and height). Each patient's weight was measured during the brief physical examination at the pretrial screening period, during the trial (at <ref type="bibr">Weeks 2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">and 6)</ref>, and at the final visit (Week 8). Each patient's height was measured at the prescreening period and at the final visit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H. Data Analysis</head><p>Statistical Analytical Plan The primary endpoint was the change in CSS from baseline to the final visit, whenever that occurred. It was analyzed by an analysis of covariance that included dose as factor and the baseline values of CSS, body mass index, age, and number of Children's Mylanta Chewable Tablets as covariates. If the effect of dose was significant at p &lt; 0.05, then pairwise contrasts were used to further explore differences between treatment groups. The primary analysis was based on the intent-to-treat population.</p><p>A similar analysis was used for change in CSS at other assessments, as well as for changes in ISS at all assessments. The physician global assessment was analyzed with an analysis of 124 Clinical Review Ii-Lun Chen, M.D. sNDA 22-020/20-987 Protonix for Delayed-Release Oral Suspension/Protonix Delayed-Release <ref type="table">Tablet (pantoprazole sodium)</ref> covariance with dose as factor, and baseline BMI and number of Children's Mylanta Chewable Tablets as covariates. The number of patients who improved in Hetzel-Dent score from screening to final visit was analyzed by Fisher's exact test. Patients with a score of 0 at screening were omitted from the analysis. Baseline biopsy scores were also broken down by whether or not the patient was taking an H2RA or a PPI. The baseline CSS was summarized by baseline NERD score and the final CSS was summarized by final NERD score. Changes from baseline in growth parameters were compared within dose groups by a paired t-test. All patients from the ITT population were included in the analyses of safety, which included adverse events, early discontinuations, vital signs, laboratory measurements, endoscopy an biopsy results. The proportion of patients who discontinued early was compared among dose groups by the Cochran-Armitage trend test. The incidence of AEs was analyzed similarly. The proportions of patients with potentially clinically important values or changes in vital signs and laboratory parameters were analyzed by the Cochran-Armitage trend test. Changes from baseline in vital signs and laboratory parameters were compared within dose groups by a paired t-test.</p><p>Esophageal biopsies were obtained at baseline and again at the final visit to evaluate the presence of mucosal disease and to determine if there had been a therapeutic response. The proportion of patients who had a baseline NERD score of 1 or 2 and then had a final score of 0 were compared among treatment groups by Fisher's exact test.</p><p>Baseline scores were also broken down by whether or not the patient was taking an H2RA or a PPI. The baseline CSS was summarized by baseline NERD score and the final CSS was summarized by final NERD score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Determination of Sample Size</head><p>The Applicant based the sample size on regulatory and practical needs and was not by statistical power. With 16 patients per dose group, there was an approximately 80% chance that an AE with an incidence of 10% in patients receiving a particular dose could be observed. If the mean CSS was 70 in the pantoprazole 10 mg group, 45 in the pantoprazole 20 mg group, and 20 in the pantoprazole 40 mg group, then, with a standard deviation of 45, the power was 70% that a significant difference among the groups would be observed. The sample size estimates are based on a field test done by Wyeth in which patients were given the questionnaire without any treatment. Patients with GERD had a mean CSS of 69.2, while healthy children had a mean CSS of 20.1. Pantoprazole 40 mg has been shown to greatly reduce symptoms in adults, so with treatment symptoms should be similar to non-GERD patients. Pantoprazole 10 mg was significantly less effective and assumed to be similar to placebo in adults.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disposition of Patients</head><p>A total of 76 patients were screened to receive a daily dose of pantoprazole; 11 patients did not meet the initial entry criteria. A total of 65 patients underwent endoscopy; 5 did not meet entry criteria and 7 were excluded based on histology results (4 without GERD, and 3 with eosinophilic esophagitis). Overall, 23 patients did not meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria, including 3 patients with eosinophilic esophagitis, and were considered screen failures. Fifty 125 Clinical Review Ii-Lun Chen, M.D. sNDA 22-020/20-987 Protonix for Delayed-Release Oral Suspension/Protonix Delayed-Release <ref type="table">Tablet (pantoprazole sodium)</ref> three patients (ITT population) aged 5 to 11 years were randomly assigned to receive either pantoprazole 10 mg (n = 19), 20 mg (n = 18), or 40 mg (n = 16) once daily. Of the 53 randomly assigned patients, 4 had erosive esophagitis and 49 had non-erosive GERD. No patient was enrolled using 24-hour esophageal pH-metry diagnosis for confirmation of diagnosis. All 53 patients took at least one dose of trial drug (ITT/safety population) and 52 completed Visit 6 (end of treatment, Week 8). One patient in the 10 mg dose group withdrew after four weeks of treatment. Of the 53 ITT patients, 44 were in the VFE population: 15 in the 10 mg group, 15 in the 20 mg group, and 14 in the 40 mg pantoprazole group. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 17</ref> from the Applicant. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discontinuations</head><p>Of the 53 patients who received pantoprazole in the trial, only one (5%) withdrew from the trial. Patient 006-060 in the pantoprazole 10 mg group discontinued from the trial because the patient's mother withdrew consent because of lack of effectiveness on Day 27. The patient's 126 Clinical Review Ii-Lun Chen, M.D. sNDA 22-020/20-987 Protonix for Delayed-Release Oral Suspension/Protonix Delayed-Release Tablet (pantoprazole sodium) mother administered Tums (secondary reason for withdrawal) which was considered a prohibited medication; while the patient was receiving trial medication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Compliance</head><p>The first date of trial medication was the day after Visit 2. This date was obtained from the randomization, trial test article, and antacid record of each patient CRF. The last date of trial medication was the day before the final visit (generally Visit 6=Week 8). Patient compliance with the test article regimen was assessed by an accurate count of the test article. The percentage of patient compliance was calculated from the amount of medication dispensed and the amount counted at each visit. A compliance rate ≥ 80% was expected throughout the trial.</p><p>Compliance was defined by the number of days on which a patient took trial medication divided by the duration of treatment. All 53 randomized patients took at least one dose of trial drug (ITT population), and 52 completed visit 6 (end of treatment). Of the 53 patients, five patients missed doses more than 20% of the time. The five patients (006-061, 006-063, 021-228, 022-242, and 022-244) with compliance &lt; 80% were excluded from the VFE population. A total of 48 patients (91%) took &gt; 80% of their daily doses of pantoprazole.</p><p>No systematic deviations in the conduct of the trial were noted. All individual violations of the protocol were evaluated by the medical monitor. Of ten patients with protocol violations, four took prohibited medications (three of which were on low dose), five missed doses more than 20% of the time, and one patient (006-061) in the pantoprazole 40 mg group took prohibited medication and missed doses of trial medication more than 30% of the time. All these patients, except 011-110 were excluded from the VFE population. No other major protocol deviations/violations occurred during this trial.</p><p>During the treatment period, a patient was able to remain in the VFE population if the patient took a prohibited medication sporadically for an AE at the discretion of medical monitor. A total of seven patients took prohibited medications during the treatment with pantoprazole. A summary of prohibited medications by dose group is given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_17">Table 60</ref> from the Applicant. Two of the seven patients took antacids (Tums and Alka-seltzer), three patients took an H2RA (ranitidine), one patient took Pepto-Bismol, and one patient took Mylanta during the treatment period. Six of the 7 patients (86%) taking prohibited acid reducing prohibited medications were in the 10 mg dose group.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary Effectiveness Analysis</head><p>The primary endpoint was the change in the CSS as a measure of wellbeing from baseline to the final visit (week 8). The following table copied from the Applicant summarizes the mean CSS values at baseline and Week 8, along with the changes in the mean from baseline to the final evaluation. The mean CSS values improved significantly from baseline to the final visit both for the ITT (p &lt; 0.001) and VFE (p &lt; 0.001) populations in all three dose groups.

Most of the patients in the three treatment groups showed improvement in NERD scores. No statistically significant findings related changes in Hetzel-Dent score or NERD score were seen with change in CSS (baseline to Week 8).  Four patients, including three patients in the 20 mg and one patient in the 40 mg dose groups, had EE and Hetzel-Dent scores ≥ grade 2 at baseline. At the end of the trial, all of these patients had a score of 0 (normal) or 1 and were considered healed. No significant differences were seen in changes among or between the treatment groups in Hetzel-Dent scores. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary Endpoints</head><p>The following secondary endpoints were evaluated and analyzed for the three treatment groups: o Change in ISS from baseline at each assessment and the change in CSS from baseline at each assessment (other than the final visit, which constitutes the primary endpoint). o Amount of antacid taken between visits. o Physician global assessment at the final visit.</p><p>Individual Symptom Improvement At the baseline visit (Week -1), the majority of patients reported abdominal pain/belly pain, burping/belching, and pain after eating. Chest pain/ heartburn was also reported in a majority of patients in the 20 mg and 40 mg groups. Of the eight symptoms, abdominal pain/belly pain, nausea, burping/belching, and pain after eating contributed the most to the overall CSS results. The number and percentage of patients with these symptoms decreased from baseline to the last visit at Week 8 after treatment with pantoprazole 10, 20, or 40 mg. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ISS Improvement</head><p>For each symptom, the ISS was defined as the product of the number of times the individual symptom occurred (frequency) and the severity of that individual symptom (ranging from mild =1 to most severe = 7) in the previous seven days. Although there were some fluctuations from week to week, the mean symptom scores tended to decrease steadily over time. No clear dose response is noted, however.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>132</head><p>Clinical Review Ii-Lun Chen, M.D. sNDA 22-020/20-987 Protonix for Delayed-Release Oral Suspension/Protonix Delayed-Release Tablet (pantoprazole sodium) Time to Improvement Overall, significant improvements in the mean CSS of GERD symptoms were seen from baseline to all visits during and after treatment with pantoprazole 20 mg and 40 mg <ref type="table" target="#tab_17">(Table 68</ref> from Wyeth). Significant decreases from baseline in the mean CSS of GERD symptoms were observed for all three treatment groups, starting at Week 3 and continuing to Week 10 (p &lt; 0.05).</p><p>These results indicate that symptoms improved faster in the 20 and 40 mg dose groups compared with the 10 mg dose group. But by end of treatment, there was similar dose response across all groups. Use of Antacid A total of 24 Mylanta tablets were dispensed to each patient for a two-week period. Patients in 20 mg and 40 mg groups used slightly fewer Mylanta tablets at Weeks 7 to 8 than they had at baseline. However, there was no change in antacid use in the 10 mg group. Comment: This information combined with the fact that three patients had protocol violations of using prohibited antacid medications in the 10 mg dose group suggest that this dose is not effective for symptom improvement of GERD.</p><p>Physician Global Assessment at the Final Visit Pantoprazole effectiveness was evaluated by the investigators at the end of treatment. In the opinion of the investigators, a majority of patients in the pantoprazole 10 mg (58%) and 40 mg (56%) groups had improved greatly at the end of treatment. Eight (44%) patients in the 20 mg group showed improvement in their GERD symptoms at the end of treatment. None of the patients in this trial worsened. Similar results were obtained for the VFE population. In the opinion of the investigators, the patients had significant disease improvement at the end of therapy within all three dose groups of pantoprazole (p &lt; 0.001), although no significant difference was seen among the dose groups (p &gt; 0.433).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Effectiveness Endpoints Frequency of symptoms</head><p>The number of times that each individual symptom occurred (frequency) and the severity of that individual symptom (ranging from mild = 1 to most severe = 7) were evaluated before the baseline visit and in the week before the patient's last visit. In general, the incidence of each symptom decreased from the baseline to the last visit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effectiveness Conclusions</head><p>Analysis of the trial report indicates that pantoprazole 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg all improved GERD symptoms in patients aged 5 to 11 years, although there is no comparator arm such as active or placebo-control. The time to symptom resolution and rates of symptom response was significantly better at Week 1 in the 20 mg and 40 mg group compared with 10 mg group, although by Week 3 there was significant improvement in symptom resolution in all dose groups. The only patient who discontinued treatment because of lack of effectiveness was in the 10 mg dose group. In addition, 6 of the 7 (87%) of patients taking prohibited acid reducing medications were in the 10 mg group. All four patients with EE were healed by the end of the trial as shown by the Hetzel-Dent score. In conclusion, the data supports extrapolation of efficacy from the adult population to pediatric patients ages 5 to 11 years.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exposure</head><p>All 53 patients received pantoprazole for ≥ 21 days. Only patient 006-060 in the pantoprazole 10 mg group discontinued from trial because of lack of effectiveness on Day 27. All other patients completed eight weeks of treatment with pantoprazole; 34 (65%) of these patients received trial medication.</p><p>Of the 19 patients who were randomized to the 10 mg dose group, all received about 0.3 mg/kg pantoprazole. Of the 18 patients who were randomized to the 20 mg dose group, 15 (83%) received about 0.6 to 0.9 mg/kg pantoprazole and three patients received about 0.3 mg/kg pantoprazole. Of the 16 patients who were originally assigned to the 40 mg dose group, 13 (81%) received about 1.2 mg/kg pantoprazole or more and three received about 0.6 to 0.9 mg/kg pantoprazole.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse Events</head><p>A total of 48 patients (91%) reported one or more AEs, including 17 patients (90%) in the 10 mg group, 16 patients (89%) in the 20 mg group, and 15 patients (91%) in the 40 mg group. The incidence of AEs was similar among the treatment groups (p = 0.639). An AE was considered a TEAE if (1) it was not present at baseline and was not a chronic condition that was part of the patient's medical history, or <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(2)</ref> it was present at baseline or as part of the subject's medical history but the severity or frequency increased during treatment. TEAEs were reported by 48 137 Clinical Review Ii-Lun Chen, M.D. sNDA 22-020/20-987 Protonix for Delayed-Release Oral Suspension/Protonix Delayed-Release Tablet (pantoprazole sodium) (91%) patients treated with pantoprazole: 17 (90%) in the 10 mg group, 16 (89%) in the 20 mg group, and 15 (91%) in the 40 mg group; the differences among the different dose groups were not statistically significant.</p><p>The most common TEAEs in the pantoprazole 10 mg group were headache (7; 37%), rhinitis (5; 26%), accidental injury and infection (4 each; 21%), and nausea (3; 16%). The most common TEAEs in the pantoprazole 20 mg group were headache (5; 28%), infection and rhinitis <ref type="bibr">(3 each; 17%)</ref>. The most common TEAEs in the pantoprazole 40 mg group were headache (4; 25%), accidental injury (5; 31%), abdominal pain, infection, asthma, and pharyngitis <ref type="bibr">(3 each; 19%)</ref>.</p><p>The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate and considered by the investigator to be unrelated to the trial medication. There were four patients total (21%) in the 10 mg group reported TEAEs including headache (3; 16%), nausea (1; 5%), and urinary incontinence (1; 5%) that were considered to be related to the trial drug. There were also four (22%) patients in the 20 mg group that reported TEAEs including abdominal pain (1; 6%), increased appetite (1; 6%), nausea (1; 6%), dizziness (1; 6%), and insomnia (1; 6%). There was one patient (6%) with headache in the 40 mg group that was considered to be related to the trial medication.</p><p>Overall, in the total population, the most frequent TEAEs were headache, accidental injury, infection, and rhinitis. The frequency of the occurrence of TEAEs did not increase with increasing dose. Incidence rates of AEs for patients treated with pantoprazole were not significantly different among the different dose groups. The trends seen for the incidence of AEs in this trial are similar to those seen in the approved package insert for pantoprazole with the exception of accidental injury, which is likely more common in the pediatric population as compared to adults. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Related Discontinuations None</head><p>Other Clinically Important Adverse Events All laboratory data were examined to identify individual subjects who had findings of potential clinical importance (PCI). Individual results were examined if the values were outside the PCI criteria delineated in <ref type="table" target="#tab_22">Table 70</ref> at any time other than the pretreatment baseline visit. had PCI laboratory values compared with the patients in 20 mg (3 of 18; 17%) or 10 mg (1 of 19; 5%) groups. However, the range of reported abnormalities was very low and no patients were withdrawn from the trial because of abnormal laboratory test results. For each patient with laboratory test results identified as PCI, the WR medical monitor reviewed the data and pertinent sections of the CRF adverse event record and determined that none of the abnormal laboratory values were reported to be of clinical importance.  Uric Acid @ Wk 4, 8 <ref type="bibr">(-17.3±27µmol/L, p=0.02)</ref> UA Spec Grav @ Wk 4 (1±0.01, p=0.03) (-0.7±2.5 sec, p=0.05) Total Protein @ Wk 4 <ref type="bibr">(3.2±5.6, p=0.04)</ref> Comment: All lab values that were noted as PCI abnormal above only at Week 4 normalized by Week 8. The Week 8 bilirubin mean level was lower on therapy than compared to baseline. There do not appear to be any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vital Signs</head><p>The criteria for determining PCI changes in vital signs are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 10</ref>.5.1-1. The changes refer to comparisons with pretrial values. Information on the seven patients identified as having PCI changes in weight was examined by the medical monitor. The Applicant speculates that the weight gain observed in the 6 (11%) patients may have been due to increased food intake that resulted from the improved symptoms. This is an optimistic interpretation by Wyeth, I am unable to evaluate the conclusion given the limited information available.</p><p>No significant differences were observed in vital signs among the treatment groups. The vital sign results for individual patients with potentially clinical important changes were examined over time and for possible other etiologies related to these elevations. The changes were not considered to be of clinical significance. In addition, the elevations were not statistically significant among the treatment groups weight, temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electrocardiograms</head><p>Patients with ECG findings of PCI were identified and were evaluated by the medical monitor. One patient (023-0256) in the 40 mg dose group had an abnormal mild intraventricular delay at Visit 8 which was considered to be a PCI. The patient's ECG was normal otherwise and reviewed by the medical monitor indicated that the mild intraventricular delay not to be of actual clinical significance. No abnormal QTc changes were reported.</p><p>Growth Parameter Analyses BMI and Height: BMI and height values were measured at the pretrial screening period (visit 2) and at the final visit of the treatment period (Week 8). There was significant height increase seen in the 10 mg and 40 mg treatment groups for height. For the mean height z-scores calculated there were no significant changes were seen in any treatment group. There was no significant changes from baseline to the end of treatment were seen in any treatment group in BMI Z-score.</p><p>Weight: Each patient's weight was measured during the pretrial screening period, during the trial <ref type="bibr">(Weeks 2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">and 6)</ref>, and at the final visit (Week 8), and mean weight z-scores were calculated.</p><p>Statistically significant increases from baseline were noted in mean values for weight and height at Week 8 in the pantoprazole 10 mg and 40 mg dose groups (p &lt; 0.04). The patients in the 20 mg group had a significant mean increase in weight at Week 8 (p = 0.02). Small increases in weight and height would be expected in growing children aged 5 to 11 years of age. It is likely that increases in weight and height were related to the expected growth in these children. The Applicant states that in addition, it is possible that improvements in GI symptoms could be associated with increased food intake. Longer term data with more patients would be required to make such an association.</p><p>Comment: Overall, short term treatment on pantoprazole does not appear to negatively impact the growth parameters measured.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Conclusions</head><p>(b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(4)</ref> No deaths, SAEs, or discontinuations due to AE were reported in this trial. The incidence of AEs reported in this trial are similar to those reported in the current package insert for pantoprazole. The incidence of AEs was similar among the treatment groups (p = 0.639), and no concerning signal of dose response was noted. The most frequent AE for all treatment groups was headaches. There does not appear to be negative impact of short term drug treatment on growth parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>For the patient population ages 5 to 11 years, a pantoprazole dose of 20 mg or 40 mg appears to have acceptable safety profile and to support effectiveness in the short-term treatment of EE. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. General Design and Objective</head><p>Trial 3001A1-326-US (Trial 326) is a Phase 3, multicenter, out-patient, randomized, doubleblind, parallel treatment group trial of the safety, tolerability, and clinical outcomes of two doses (20 and 40 mg) of oral pantoprazole in children (12 to 16 yrs old) with symptomatic GERD. Patients received the trial drug once daily for eight weeks. Safety assessments were based on reports of adverse events (AEs) and results of routine physical examinations, laboratory determinations, and vital sign measurements. The GERD Assessment of Symptoms-Pediatric Questionnaire (GASP-Q) was used as a measure of patient well being to evaluate symptom response.</p><p>This trial took place between <ref type="bibr">Oct 4, 2002, and</ref><ref type="bibr">Sep 30, 2004</ref>. A total of 24 of 35 sites enrolled patients. There were 159 patients who were screened and 130 patients completed the trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary Objective</head><p>The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral pantoprazole (20 mg and 40 mg once daily) in patients aged 12 to 16 years with symptomatic GERD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary Objective</head><p>The secondary objective of this trial was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of treatment with oral pantoprazole (20 mg and 40 mg once daily) in patients aged 12 to 16 years with symptomatic GERD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Background</head><p>As stated in the Written Request for Pediatric Trials with Pantoprazole Sodium, Trial 5 requires enrollment of patients: a) aged 12 to 16 years inclusive, b) with a clinical diagnosis of suspected GERD, symptomatic GERD, or endoscopically proven GERD. Endoscopy was not required for trial entry or participation. For both sexes, outcome measures will be assessed weekly: at the clinical visits at least once every other week as well as by other appropriate means during weeks in which no clinic visit is scheduled. For example, telephone evaluations may be made to assess the incidence of adverse events, and other clinical outcomes. At least 100 patients will complete at least eight weeks of treatment. The objectives of Trial 5 are: (a) to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of single and repeated doses of pantoprazole sodium in pediatric patients 12-16 years of age, and (b) to collect information on the safety of single and repeated doses of pantoprazole sodium in pediatric patients 12 to 16 years of age.</p><p>Protocol Amendments Amendment 1 <ref type="bibr">(submitted to IND No. 35,441 on Feb 21, 2003, Serial No. 350)</ref>: The following key revisions to the protocol were made:</p><p>1. The number of sites was increased from 25 to approximately 35. 2. Exclusion criterion 11 was amended to exclude patients who had been on PPIs within three months prior to administration of test article. 3. Specified that once test article has been assigned to a patient, it must not be reassigned to another patient. 4. Added a paragraph to the AE section about the Health Outcome Assessment Survey to be administered, explaining that its purpose was to explore the patients' own perception about their quality of life. <ref type="bibr">Amendment 2 (submitted to IND No. 35,441 on Jul 3, 2003, Serial No. 364)</ref>: The protocol was amended primarily to revise the exclusion criteria, as requested by correspondence from the FDA dated May 28, 2003. 1. The duration of time for pretrial PPI use was shortened to 28 days before receipt of trial drug. 2. Revised height and weight inclusion criteria to be within the 5th percentile for age. 3. Patients were excluded if they had a positive urine drug toxicology test. 4. Patients were excluded if they had a known history of life-threatening drug sensitivity. 5. Patients were excluded if they had a known history of acute life-threatening event. 6. Patients were excluded if they used special diets, or herbal or alternative medication that might affect the metabolism of the trial drug. 7. Revised the definition of evaluable patient to include patients who were withdrawn because of lack of effectiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Inclusion</head><p>1. Male and nonpregnant, nonlactating female patients aged 12 through 16 years. 2. Demonstrated ability to swallow a placebo tablet identical in appearance to a pantoprazole tablet. 3. Pretrial CSS symptom score of at least 16 on the GERD Assessment of GASP-Q. 4. Clinical diagnosis of suspected GERD, symptomatic GERD, or endoscopically proven GERD. 5. Weight and height ≥ 5th percentile for the patient's age. 6. Female patients who had had the onset of menses: a) Were required to have a negative urine b-HCG test result before receiving test article; b) And if sexually active, were required to use medically acceptable contraception, and were required to sign an IRB-approved child assent, which reflected an awareness of the stipulations concerning the use of contraception in sexually active females and the use of medically acceptable contraception (including oral contraception, injectable or implantable methods, and intrauterine devices).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Exclusion</head><p>Similar to infant trial (Section 9.4.1-D). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Treatment</head><p>Patients were randomized to receive one of the following regimens daily for eight weeks: 1. Pantoprazole 20 mg enteric-coated tablet. 2. Pantoprazole 40 mg enteric-coated tablet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concomitant Medications</head><p>Patients were allowed to use only the oral antacid provided for this trial (Mylanta Gelcaps).</p><p>Patients continued with their usual medical therapies unless prohibited.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Endpoints</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effectiveness Measurements</head><p>The GERD Assessment of Symptoms Pediatrics Questionnaire (GASP-Q explained in Section 6.1.4) was used to evaluate the effectiveness of pantoprazole in relieving symptoms associated with GERD. The GASP-Q assessed each patient's physical well being by measuring the signs and symptoms of pediatric GERD. The frequency and usual severity of the following GERD symptoms over the preceding seven days were assessed using the GASP-Q: abdominal pain/belly pain, chest pain/heartburn, difficulty swallowing, nausea, vomiting/regurgitation, burping/belching, choking when eating, and pain after eating.</p><p>Symptoms were assessed both individually and collectively. The Individual Symptom Score (ISS) for each symptom was defined as the product of the frequency times the severity score for a given symptom at a given assessment. The Composite Symptom Score (CSS) was calculated as the sum of all individual ISS at a given assessment. Both the ISS and the CSS were calculated for each assessment, which was weekly. To be eligible for the trial, the CSS at Visit 1 had to be at least 16. Baseline for symptom scores was the last assessment before the first dose of trial medication.</p><p>The Physician Global Assessment (PGA) is a seven-point Likert scale of the overall impression of the effectiveness of the test article at the end of treatment compared with baseline. This was performed at the final visit (Visit 6). The physician checked 1 of 7 boxes, indicating how he/she assessed the impact of pantoprazole on the patient's disease compared with baseline. Choices included the following: disease improved greatly (=1), disease improved moderately, disease improved slightly, no impact, disease worsened slightly, disease worsened moderately, or disease worsened greatly (=7).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary Effectiveness Variables</head><p>The primary endpoint was the change in the CSS from the baseline to the last on-treatment evaluation at Week 8. The ISS and the CSS were calculated for each assessment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary Effectiveness Variables</head><p>Other endpoints included: 1. Change in CSS from baseline to other assessments. 2. Change in ISS from baseline to each assessment. 3. Whether or not the CSS was &lt; 16 at each assessment. 4. Time in weeks when the CSS fell below 16, the entry threshold, and stayed below 16 through week 8. 5. The number of times each symptom occurred in the 7 days prior to an assessment. 6. The severity of each symptom in the 7 days prior to an assessment. 7. Amount of antacid taken between visits. 8. Physician global assessment. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations A central lab was used for all required trial laboratory tests. The following parameters were obtained: CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, urinalysis, and coagulation studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vital Signs and Growth Parameters</head><p>Complete physical examinations with vital signs, growth parameters (ht and wt), and ECG were done.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H. Data Analysis</head><p>Statistical Analytical Plan Analyses for Week 8 were based on the last on-therapy questionnaire submitted for each patient, that is, a last-observation-carried forward analysis. For time point analyses, missing data were excluded. On symptom questionnaires, if the frequency was shown to be zero, then any response for severity was ignored. If the frequency was shown to be zero but the severity was missing, the severity was assumed to be zero. If frequency was missing, but any value of severity was checked, then the frequency was assumed to be one. If frequency was not zero and was not missing but severity score was missing, then the severity score was assumed to be seven.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Determination of Sample Size</head><p>The number of patients was based on the Pediatric Written Request and practical needs and was not set by statistical power. With at least 50 patients per dose group, there was approximately an 80% chance that an AE that has an incidence of 3% in patients receiving a particular dose would be observed. Thus, the trial was not powered to be able to detect a treatment difference, rather it is a safety trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis Populations</head><p>The safety population consisted of all patients who received any amount of trial medication. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of all patients who took any amount of pantoprazole provided for the trial, were not screen failures, and had at least one questionnaire filled out from Week 1 to 8. This was the primary analysis population. The valid-for-efficacy (VFE) population consisted of patients from the ITT population who completed eight weeks of treatment (at least 50 days), took at least 80% of scheduled trial medication, had a completed GASP-Q at Week 8, and did not violate the protocol in a major way as determined by the medical monitor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disposition of Patients</head><p>A total of 159 patients were screened for this trial. Of these, 23 patients were screen failures and were not randomized to treatment. Of the remaining 136 patients, 68 patients were randomly assigned to the pantoprazole 20 mg group and 68 patients were randomly assigned to the pantoprazole 40 mg group. All 136 patients randomized to treatment received at least one dose of trial drug and completed at least one GASP-Q, and are included in the safety/ITT population.</p></div>

Patient 326-008-127 (40 mg) discontinued because of lack of effectiveness, Patient 326-002-028 (20 mg) discontinued by request ("tired of being in the study"), and Patient 326-024-450 (40 mg) discontinued after multiple unsuccessful attempts at venipuncture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>151</head><p>Clinical Review Ii-Lun Chen, M.D. sNDA 22-020/20-987 Protonix for Delayed-Release Oral Suspension/Protonix Delayed-Release Tablet (pantoprazole sodium) Protocol Deviations Protocol deviations were noted for the following patients who violated inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patient 326-022-401 had weight, and Patients 326-003-056 and 044-976 had height that was below the fifth percentile for their age at screening. Patient 326-031-627 was enrolled simultaneously in another trial (an NIH outcomes trial involving Flu-Mist). Since these deviations were not expected to affect the results of this trial or patient safety, exceptions were granted to enroll these patients. Other deviations from the protocol consisted mainly of prohibited concomitant medications, trial visits that occurred outside the specified time window, or laboratory specimens that were missing or could not be analyzed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Compliance</head><p>Overall drug compliance was calculated as the number of tablets taken throughout the trial divided by 56 days. In the ITT population, mean drug compliance was 91 ± 15%, with the 20 mg group slightly higher (93± 12%) than the 40 mg group (88± 17%). In the VFE population, mean drug compliance was 95% ± 7% with no difference between dose groups. On an individual basis, compliance was calculated as the number of tablets taken divided by days on treatment. A total of 21 patients were less than 80% compliant, seven patients were less than 70% compliant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographics</head><p>The majority of patients in the trial were white adolescent females. The median age of the trial population was 14 years (range 12-16 years) for both groups. The mean GASP-Q CSS score at screening was 187, and at baseline was 176. Demographic characteristics were similar between the dose groups. The most common symptom at baseline was burping/belching, with an ISS of 41.5, abdominal pain/belly pain was also common, with a baseline ISS of 32.1. Baseline symptoms were comparable between dose groups.   Concomitant Therapy/Medications Acetaminophen (59, 43%), ibuprofen (51, 38%), and albuterol (18, 13%) were the non-trial medications that were most frequently taken during the trial. Other concomitant medications were taken by at most 9 patients (7%) that included: advair, cetirizine hydrochloride, diphenhydramine hydrochloride, fluticasone, Miralax, naproxen, and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride. The treatment groups appear relatively comparable.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary Effectiveness Results</head><p>The primary endpoint was the change in the CSS from baseline to the last on-treatment evaluation at Week 8. For the ITT population, the CSS decreased approximately 100 points after eight weeks of treatment in both dose groups (Applicant <ref type="table" target="#tab_22">Table 78</ref>). This was a statistically significant change indicating improvement in symptoms for each group (p&lt;0.001). Results for the VFE population were comparable, with an even larger decline observed for the 40 mg VFE patients. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary Effectiveness Endpoints</head><p>The GASP-Q was administered weekly during the trial, either in person or by telephone. The following secondary endpoints on the GASP-Q were analyzed: CSS: change from baseline each week CSS &lt; 16 at each assessment. ISS: symptom frequency, severity, change from baseline to each assessment.</p><p>In addition to the GASP-Q, other secondary endpoints included the following: Amount of antacid taken between visits. Physician global assessment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Change in CSS by Trial Week</head><p>A steady decline in mean CSS was observed in the ITT population throughout the course of this trial. A lower CSS was observed as early as Week 1. Results for the VFE population were comparable with the ITT population.</p><p>The number of patients with a CSS below the entry criteria (less than 16) increased in both dose groups as the trial progressed. More patients in the 40 mg group achieved CSS below entry threshold at Week 1 (p = 0.048) and Week 6 (p =0.041) but not at Week 8 (p = 1.00). In addition to the number of patients with each symptom, the frequency with which these symptoms occurred during each one-week period decreased from baseline to week 8 in both dose groups. After eight weeks of treatment, the frequency with which each symptom occurred had decreased in most cases by half. However, the severity of symptoms did not change much after eight weeks of treatment. See Applicant's <ref type="table" target="#tab_23">Table 80</ref> for details. Consistent with the decreased number of patients reporting each symptom and the decreased frequency, the mean ISS for each symptom was significantly lower at Week 8 compared with baseline in both dose groups for the ITT population. The results for the ISS in the VFE population were comparable with the ITT population. There was no difference between dose groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Antacid Use</head><p>Mylanta Gelcaps were provided for use as antacid rescue medication. There was no difference between treatment groups in antacid use or the number of patients taking antacids in any twoweek period. Antacid use decreased slightly at the end of the trial, but the change was not significant in the ITT population (p=0.16 and 0.78 for the 20 mg and 40 mg groups, respectively). Comment: The use of antacid tablets was lower at baseline for the 40mg group, so the comparative change is hard to detect. The clinical significance of these changes from baseline to week 8 even though statistically significant is questionable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Physician Global Assessment</head><p>The physician global assessment, performed at Week 8, rated most patients (&gt;75%) as moderately or greatly improved <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 81</ref>). Both groups demonstrated significant improvement compared with baseline (p&lt;0.001). No patients were rated as having moderately or greatly worsened. Results for the VFE population were comparable with the ITT population. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effectiveness Conclusions</head><p>There was GASP-Q score improvement in symptoms by Week 1 (p&lt;0.001 from Week 1 through 10; except Week 2 with p = 0.017 for CSS for the 40 mg dose group). The number of patients with a CSS below the entry criteria (less than 16) increased as the trial progressed. The ISS and the frequency of symptoms decreased, but the severity of symptoms did not change. The use of antacid as rescue medication decreased slightly at the end of the trial, but there were no differences between groups in antacid use or the number of patients taking antacids. The physician global assessment, performed at Week 8, demonstrated improvement compared to baseline. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Evaluation</head><p>Exposure All 136 randomized patients are included in the safety analysis. Patients were in the trial for an average of 56 days of therapy, and received an average of 51 tablets of treatment. Compliance was above 90% on average. Although almost all the patients in the 20 mg group stayed in the trial through Week 8, five patients in the 40 mg group discontinued midway through the trial. <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 82</ref> from the Applicant shows the comparison between treatment groups with regards to compliance which was similar at approximately 90%. In the 20 mg group, the majority of patients received 0.3 mg/kg pantoprazole as seem in the Applicant' <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">s Table 83</ref>. In the 40 mg group, the majority of patients received 0.6-0.9 mg/kg pantoprazole. There was considerable overlap between dose groups in the 0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg dose range. On a dose-by-weight basis, only 28 patients in the 40 mg group received 0.9 mg/kg or higher, which is the dose level that was unique to the higher dose group and not shared with the 20 mg group. Adverse Events A total of 113 patients (83%) reported one or more AEs, including 60 patients (88%) in the 20 mg group and 53 patients (78%) in the 40 mg group. The incidence of AEs was similar between treatment groups with the exception of diarrhea, which had a higher incidence in the 40 mg group. An AE was considered a TEAE if (1) it was not present at baseline and was not a chronic condition that was part of the patient's medical history, or <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(2)</ref> it was present at baseline or as part of the patient's medical history but the severity or frequency increased during treatment. TEAEs were reported by 112 patients (82%) during the trial: 59 (87%) in the 20 mg group and 53 (78%) in the 40 mg group; differences between the two dose groups were not statistically significant.</p><p>The most common TEAE was headache, reported by 47 patients (35%), 25 in the 20 mg group and 22 in the 40 mg group. Other common TEAEs were infection (32 patients total, 23%), and pharyngitis (26 patients total, 19%). Accidental injury was more common in the 20 mg group (13 patients compared with 4 patients in the 40 mg group, p=0.036) and diarrhea was more common in the 40 mg group (7 patients compared with 1 patient in the 20 mg group, p=0.062). All other AEs occurred with comparable frequency between the dose groups.</p><p>Headache was considered to be related to trial medication for 24 (35%) of the 47 patients reporting this TEAE. The majority of headaches were mild. Severe headaches considered to be related to trial drug were reported for four patients, and two additional patients had severe headaches that were not related to trial drug. Headache led to early discontinuation of three patients. Overall, TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity. Abdominal pain was severe for three patients, for two of whom the pain was severe and considered to be related to trial drug. Flu syndrome, cholecystitis, flatulence, myalgia, dizziness, and ovarian cyst were severe for one patient each; only severe flatulence and severe dizziness were considered to be related to trial drug. In addition to headache, other related TEAEs were abdominal pain (4), diarrhea and dizziness <ref type="bibr">(3 each)</ref>, and ALT/SGPT increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(2)</ref>. Lab test abnormal (increased gastrin), anorexia, constipation, flatulence, hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia, AST/SGOT increased, insomnia, furunculosis, and abnormal vision were considered to be related to trial drug for one patient each.</p><p>Diarrhea, reported by one patient in the 20 mg group and by seven patients in the 40 mg group, was the only AE for which the incidence increased with increasing dose (p = 0.062). Accidental injury, unrelated to trial medication, was more common in patients in the 20 mg group (p = 0.036).  Serious Adverse Events There were no deaths in this trial. There was one SAE reported in this trial. Patient 326-013 0228, a 12-year-old white female, had a history of seasonal allergies, reactive airway disease, and constipation. Her baseline visit was on Nov 18, 2003, and she started treatment with pantoprazole 20 mg the next day. At Week 5, she complained of abdominal pain. An inflamed gall bladder was diagnosed, and a cholecystectomy was performed on . The patient was hospitalized overnight and discharged on , with Vicoden and Tylenol. The patient fully recovered and completed the trial on Jan 12, 2004 with 98.2% trial drug compliance. The event was considered to be unrelated to the trial medication.</p><p>Comment: The narrative on this patient is very short on the CRF, and it does not allow for any firm evaluation to be made regarding the association of the SAE to the trial treatment. The patient was not at any known risk for developing cholecystitis, and given the timing of the SAE, it is possible that there is an association with trial treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Related Discontinuations</head><p>Headache, in all cases considered related to trial medication, led to the withdrawal of three patients in the 40 mg group. Patient 326-03-0057 discontinued because of mild headache "definitely related" to trial drug after receiving 19 doses of pantoprazole 40 mg. Patient 326 021-0377 discontinued because of moderate headache "possibly related" to trial drug after receiving 20 doses of pantoprazole 40 mg. Patient 326-040-0852 discontinued because of severe headache "definitely related" to trial drug after receiving 25 doses of pantoprazole 40 mg. These patients all received ≥ 0.8 mg/kg of pantoprazole. All headaches resolved after discontinuation of trial drug.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Laboratory Evaluations</head><p>During the trial, 53 patients had laboratory values of potential clinical importance. The most frequent PCI laboratory value was platelet count increased for five patients (4%). For urinalysis, increased hemoglobin was recorded for 27 patients (20%) and increased protein/albumin recorded for 20 patients (15%). All other PCI laboratory values were reported for one or two patients only. There were no significant differences in values of PCI between the 20 mg and 40 mg treatment groups. None of these findings was considered to be clinically significant and they did not appear to pose a safety risk to the patients. Mean changes in laboratory tests that were statistically significant compared with baseline (p&lt;0.05) but were not clinically important included the following: Liver enzymes did not change significantly from baseline during the trial. Three patients had liver enzyme values that were reported as AEs: patient 326-026-509 (40 mg group) with mildly elevated AST, and patients 326-005-878 and 326-027-533, both in the 20 mg group, with elevated ALT values. Urinalysis at Week 4 and 8 showed that protein/albumin, hemoglobin/blood, nitrites, and leukocyte esterase were positive for up to five patients in the 20 mg group. In the 40 mg group, hemoglobin/blood was positive for up to seven patients and leukocyte esterase was positive for one patient. There was no difference between the groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vital Signs and Other Parameter Analyses</head><p>During the trial, 24 patients had changes from baseline in vital signs that met the PCI criteria. None of these was considered clinically important. Weight gain was the most common change, reported for 10 patients. Weight loss sufficient to meet the PCI criteria was reported for four patients. It is difficult to explain the wide variability in weight. Decreases in sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure were noted for five patients each. Low heart rate for one patient (326 047-1056, 41 bpm) was preceded by low pulse measurements of 49-59 bpm at earlier visits. No adverse event was reported. There were no significant differences in PCI values between the treatment groups. None of these findings was considered clinically significant by the investigators and they did not appear to pose a safety risk to the patients.</p><p>Weight: An increase in mean weight during the trial was statistically significant compared with baseline, but this was not considered clinically important.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>163</head><p>Clinical Review Ii-Lun Chen, M.D. sNDA 22-020/20-987 Protonix for Delayed-Release Oral Suspension/Protonix Delayed-Release Tablet (pantoprazole sodium) Height: Each patient's height was measured during the pretrial period (visit 2) and at the final visit (Week 8). However, 28 of the 68 patients treated with 20 mg pantoprazole and 30 of the 68 patients treated with 40 mg pantoprazole had height evaluation at or before Week 8. Therefore, patients' records were evaluated to obtain their height for up to six months and up to two years after the first dose of pantoprazole. No statistically significant differences between groups were seen in the mean height at various times.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BMI:</head><p>Body mass index (BMI) was evaluated for each patient with available weight and height during pretrial screening (baseline), at final visit (Week 8), Week 8 up to six months, and Week 8 up to two years. The BMI Z-scores were calculated based on the available results from these time points. No between groups statistically significant difference were seen in the mean BMI at various visits (p &gt; 0.61). There were no significant changes in the mean BMI from baseline to Week 8, up to six months, or up to two years in any treatment group.</p><p>Comment: Overall, there were no significant alterations in growth factors as measured by weight, height, BMI and their corresponding Z-scores in this eight week trial in adolescents patients with GERD treated with either 20 or 40 mg pantoprazole. In this short term trial, growth does not appear to be negatively impacted by treatment with pantoprazole.</p><p>ECG: Four patients in the 40 mg group had ECG findings that were normal at screening but abnormal at Week 8. Patients 326-022-0414 and 326-037-0776 were observed to have sinus bradycardia, and patient 326-026-0507 had sinus arrhythmia. The abnormal change for patient 326-026-0510 was not specified. These findings were not considered clinically significant by the investigators.</p><p>Comment: ECG results were reviewed for those whose readings were normal at baseline but abnormal at end of trial. Four patient results fit this description, three of which do not appear to be clinically significant from the description of the abnormality. One of the patient ECG results are not specified and only "not clinically significant" is listed, therefore, no additional evaluation can be made.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Conclusions</head><p>In general, no major safety signals were detected from use of pantoprazole 20 mg and 40 mg in reducing symptoms of GERD in children aged 12-16 years. A total of 112 patients (82%) reported one or more TEAEs. The most common TEAE was headache, reported by a total of 47 patients (35%).</p><p>AEs occurred with comparable frequency between dose groups. Diarrhea was the AE for which there was the biggest increase in incidence increased with increasing dose, reported by one patient in the 20 mg group and by seven patients in the 40 mg group. Headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dizziness, and SGPT increased were the TEAEs considered related to trial drug that were experienced by two or more patients. The majority of TEAEs was mild or moderate in intensity and not related to trial drug. No deaths were reported in this trial, however, there was one SAE of cholecystectomy. This was reported by the investigator as not related to trial drug.</p><p>There were more safety related discontinuations in the 40 mg dose group. Three patients in the 40 mg group discontinued from the trial prematurely because of the related AE of headache. One patient in the 40 mg group withdrew prematurely from the trial because of lack of effectiveness. Changes in laboratory values, vital signs, and ECGs do not appear clinically significant and did not appear to pose a safety risk to patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>The pathophysiology of EE associated with GERD in adults and pediatric patients is thought to be the same, as such, efficacy of pantoprazole should be extrapolated to this age group. Pantoprazole doses of 20 mg and 40 mg appear to have an acceptable safety profile in this age group, thus I recommend that the dosage used for adult EE, 40 mg, be used as a reference to dose pediatric patients ages 12 to 16 years for short term treatment of EE associated with GERD. Final labeling recommendations will need to take into account results of PK studies in pediatric patients. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concomitant Medications</head><p>Concomitant medications were permitted where appropriate. Patients were to continue their usual medical therapies according to standard clinical practice. Medications that were not prohibited and were deemed necessary because of intercurrent acute or chronic disease could be administered, provided that no dose adjustment was likely to be necessary during the study.</p><p>Continuous treatment with theophylline derivatives or digoxin was closely monitored throughout the study to assure that proper serum levels of these drugs were maintained. All patients were permitted to use antacids on a daily basis as needed with the exception of:</p><p>For patients in the PK stratum, two hours before and after pantoprazole administration on days when PK blood samples were scheduled to be obtained. For patients in the PK/PD stratum, two hours before and during pH-metry on the days of PD procedures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prohibited Medications</head><p>The following medications were prohibited during the study: 1. Antacids were prohibited except as described under "Permitted medications". 2. PPIs (other than the study medication, pantoprazole) and H2RAs. 3. Use of warfarin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, or rifampin for any disorder from at least 24 hours before the first use of pantoprazole until after the final study procedure.</p><p>Patients given an acid suppressant other than pantoprazole during the active treatment phase of the study were withdrawn from the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Safety Considerations/Monitoring</head><p>There were different study schedules for the PK, PD, and PK/PD treatment groups. In general there was a screening visit, baseline visit, active treatment period on Days 1 to 6 with a final study evaluation, then a post study visit on Day 23.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Endpoints</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Measurements</head><p>The worksheet for collecting GERD and respiratory symptoms was derived from the GERD Symptoms Questionnaire in Infants (GSQ-I) and the Infant Gastroesophageal Reflux Questionnaire (I-GERQ). The GSQ-I was previously developed for use by parents to assess GERD symptoms in infants aged 1 through 11 months, at the request of the FDA. The GSQ-I was shortened to five items, and severity assessments were removed. The GSQ-I was further modified using questions from the validated I-GERQ developed by Orenstein and colleagues, and the resulting items were converted into an electronic diary (eDiary) that was used daily in trial 3001B3-329-WW (see section 9.4.1-G). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comment: The use of a daily GERD symptom diary in preterm infants and neonates is exploratory. Preterm infants taking oral feedings have GERD symptoms very similar to those in</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disposition of Patients</head><p>A total of 68 patients were screened for the study. Of these, 59 patients were randomized to the two treatment groups (19 for 1.25 mg and 20 for 2.5 mg) as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 21</ref> (copied from the Applicant). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discontinuations</head><p>Two patients were withdrawn during the study. Patient 331-031-003051 (PD stratum) was withdrawn because of a protocol violation. Patient 331-085-003501 (PK stratum) was withdrawn early because of parental request. Both infants had received 2.5-mg doses of pantoprazole.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographics</head><p>There were no statistically significant differences between the dose groups in terms of baseline demographics. All the patients participating in the study were neonates (aged ≤28 days) or preterm infants with a corrected age of less than 44 weeks. Most (54 of 59; 91.5%) were born prematurely. The median gestational age was 29 weeks. The median corrected age of the infants born prematurely was 37.5 weeks. The majority (41 of 59; 69.5%) of the patients were male. Race and ethnicity were predominantly white, non-Hispanic, but other races and ethnicities were represented in the study population.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GERD Indications at Screening</head><p>Results of four upper GI series, one esophagram, two video swallowing studies, and three laryngoscopies were consistent with GERD or showed erythema. Thus, 15% patients had test results at screening that were consistent with GERD, and nearly 85% of the patients entered the study based on clinical symptoms of GERD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concomitant Therapy/Medications</head><p>All but 1 of the 59 (98%) patients received concomitant medication during the study. Iron preparations were the most widely used products and were given to 32 (54%) patients. The second most common medications were propulsives, which were given to 18 (31%) patients, indicated for feeding intolerance as well as GERD. At least 12 (20%) patients received vitamin supplements, including multivitamin and plain vitamin preparations. Other concomitant products provided to at least 10% of the patients in the study were mydriatics or cycloplegics (11 patients; 19%); caffeine for the treatment of apnea (9 patients; 15%), nasal decongestants (8 patients; 14%); and antifungals for topical use, ascorbic acid, and laxatives (7 patients each; 12%). There were no statistically significant differences between the dose groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Congenital History of Patients</head><p>The most common congenital anomaly at birth was congenital heart disease, which was observed in 16 (27%) patients in the study population (8 patients in each dose group). For the 54 preterm infants in this study, medical history included the presence or absence of a history of any of prespecified comorbidities of prematurity. A history of complications of prematurity was reported at screening and again during the treatment period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effectiveness Evaluation</head><p>From baseline to the last day on-therapy, the mean total daily GERD symptom score decreased from 3.26 to 2.19 in the 1.25-mg dose group and from 2.94 to 2.17 in the 2.5-mg dose group. The decreases in both dose groups approached did not meet statistical significance and the decrease in total daily GERD symptom score was not significantly different between groups. <ref type="table" target="#tab_23">Table 88</ref> from the Applicant summarizes the results.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Errors</head><p>There was one minor test drug administration error which did not result in an AE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse Events</head><p>AEs were reported for 30 (51%) of the 59 patients. TEAEs were reported for 23 (39%) of 59 patients, including 5 (26%) of 19 patients in the 1.25-mg dose group and 18 (45%) of 40 patients in the 2.5-mg dose group. The difference between groups was not statistically significant.</p><p>Overall, the most common TEAEs were anemia (6 patients; 10 %), hypoxia (4 patients; 7%), constipation (3 patients; 5%), and rhinitis (3 patients; 5%). In the 1.25-mg dose group, the most common TEAE was contact dermatitis (diaper rash), which was reported in 2 (11%) patients. In the 2.5-mg dose group, the most common TEAE was anemia, which occurred in 5 (13%) patients. Between-group differences were not statistically significant.</p><p>The TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity, and most were considered not related to the test article. Two (3%) TEAEs were considered related to the test article: one was an abnormal liver test result (elevated liver enzyme) in patient 331-054-003222, and the other was contact dermatitis (diaper rash) in patient 331-054-003225. Both TEAEs were mild in severity, and both resolved. and had received six 2.5-mg daily doses of pantoprazole. The investigator did not consider the SAE to have been related to the test article.</p><p>Patient 331-217-006116 was a preterm (gestational age, 36 weeks) white male infant aged 1.9 weeks (corrected age, 37.9 weeks) who developed hematochezia without a fever or other bowel problems during the follow-up portion of the study (day 33), 27 days after the last dose of study medication. He was hospitalized; hematochezia due to colitis (not further specified) was diagnosed; and he was treated with diosmectite (Smecta). The SAE resolved three days later, and the patient was discharged. The patient was in the PD stratum and had received six 2.5-mg daily doses of pantoprazole. The investigator considered the SAE to have been not related to the test drug.</p><p>Comment: Given the timing of the events and known half life of the study drug, it is unlikely that the test drug was associated with the SAEs. I agree with the investigator assessments given the information provided in the narratives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Related Discontinuations</head><p>None.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Laboratory evaluations</head><p>One patient developed a PCI elevation in AP while on treatment with pantoprazole. Patient 331 054-003221 was a preterm (gestational age, 25 weeks), 14-week-old (corrected age, 39 weeks), white male patient whose medical history included alkaline phosphatasemia and cutis aplasia congenita. At screening he had a moderately elevated AP at 1042 mU/mL (normal range, 150 to 420 mU/mL) with a mildly elevated AST of 39 mU/mL (normal range, 0 to 37 mU/mL) and normal ALT. At the final evaluation eight days later (study Day 6), the patient's AP had risen to a PCI level of 1312 mU/mL, whereas AST and ALT remained unchanged. Comment: This patient had a baseline abnormality in AP and the change from screen given this history is not as concerning. No further f/u information is available for this patient.</p><p>One patient (331-054-003222) developed a PCI elevated AST (182 mU/mL) while on treatment with pantoprazole. This patient was preterm (gestational age, 27 weeks), 7.9-week-old (corrected age, 34.9 weeks), other-race male patient whose medical history included neonatal cholestasis with direct hyperbilirubinemia, which was reported as ongoing at study entry. The laboratory evaluation at screening showed normal AST and alkaline phosphatase levels and an elevated ALT of 90 mU/mL (normal range, 0 to 41 mU/mL); bilirubin levels were not reported. At the final evaluation, the patient's AST was elevated to a PCI level of 182 mU/mL (normal range, 0 to 37 mU/mL), ALT had risen slightly to 121 mU/mL, and alkaline phosphatase (AP) and bilirubin remained within the normal range. There was no evidence of hemolysis. No other AEs were reported for this patient. Comment: The timing of events makes it possible for there to be a relationship between AST elevation and pantoprazole treatment. There is no further information available regarding changes in the AST for this patient. In general there were more PCI lab test results in the prestudy results than in the postbaseline laboratory tests (46% vs 40% total). The tests for which there were slightly increased abnormalities in the postbaseline group were: AST (1/57 post vs. 0 pre), Alk Phos (1/57 post vs. 0 pre), CPK (1/46 post vs. 0 pre), and anemia (14/57 post vs. 7/59 pre). Other than for the low hematocrit levels in which there is a more clear discrepancy between prestudy and postbaseline, the number of patients affected is too small to make any general conclusions. There does not appear to be any between treatment group differences. None of these lab abnormalities resulted in SAEs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vital signs:</head><p>Altogether, 22 (37% vs. 24% prestudy) of 59 patients had PCI vital sign measurements during the study, including 7 (37%) patients in the 1.25-mg dose group and 15 (38%) patients in the 2.5 mg dose group. It appears that the PCI vital sign abnormality in most cases was an isolated event not sustained through subsequent measurements and not associated with corresponding changes in other vital sign parameters. The parameters in the PCI category were diastolic BP, respiratory rate, and pulse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ECG:</head><p>There were a total of five patients (9%) with ECG PCI abnormalities. One was in the low dose group and four were in the high dose group. Of these, three had the abnormalities only at screening. There was only one abnormality which was new at final evaluation: Patient 331-081 003471 was a 1.3-week-old white male infant who received seven 1.25-mg daily doses of pantoprazole. The patient's QRS interval was 55 ms at baseline and 118 ms at final evaluation. The patient had no relevant medical history, and had no AEs during the study. The investigator considered the QRS interval prolongation to be not clinically significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Growth Parameter Analyses</head><p>Mean patient weight increased from 2661 g at baseline to 2855 g in the 1.25-mg dose group and from 2679 g at baseline to 2859 g in the 2.5-mg dose group (p&lt;0.001, both groups). The increase was not significantly different between dose groups. The baseline z-scores for weight were -3.78 and -3.47 in the 1.25-and 2.5-mg dose groups respectively, likely reflecting the prematurity and associated disorders of the study patient population. At the end of the treatment period the z-scores remained unchanged at -3.74 and -3.49 respectively, indicating that over the short treatment period, the patients' growth rates for weight remained unchanged.</p><p>Mean length increased from 46.8 cm at baseline to 47.5 cm in the 1.25-mg group (not significant) and from 46.0 cm at baseline to 47.9 cm in 2.5-mg group (p&lt;0.001). The increase was not significantly different between dose groups. The baseline z-scores for length were -4.70 and -5.23 in the 1.25-mg and 2.5-mg dose groups respectively, again likely reflecting the prematurity of the study patient population. At the end of the treatment period the z-score in the 1.25-mg group was largely unchanged at -4.87, whereas in the 2.5-mg dose group the increase to -4.75 was possibly significant (p= 0.047).</p><p>Head circumference increased from 32.9 cm at baseline to 33.7 cm in the 1.25-mg dose group (p=0.02) and from 32.8 cm at baseline to 34.0 cm in the 2.5-mg dose group (p&lt;0.001). The increase was not significantly different between dose groups. The baseline z-scores for headcircumference were -3.73 and -3.68 in the 1.25-mg and 2.5-mg dose groups respectively. At the end of the treatment period, the z-score was not significantly changed at -3.60 in the 1.25-mg dose group, but there was a statistically significant increase to -3.29 in the 2.5-mg dose group (p=0.019). </p></div>

The dehydration was of moderate severity and the vomiting was considered severe. These events resolved after three days and were considered by the investigator as definitely not related to pantoprazole. Comment: According to the CRF, the patient was diagnosed with gram positive cocci positive blood culture and gastroenteritis. The patient was treated with IV fluids, ceftriaxone, and clarithromycin. The study drug was temporarily halted during the hospitalization and resumed after discharge for a total of ten non consecutive doses and completed the study on <ref type="bibr">Nov 20, 2007</ref>.

During the telephone contact on Oct 9, 2007, the mother confirmed that apnea episodes had resolved, but the GERD was ongoing. The investigator considered this event life threatening and probably not related to test article. The investigator attributed the SAE to the washout period, when the patient discontinued the previous GERD medication as required by the protocol. Comment: I can not rule out a possible association of the study drug to the apneic event. However, acute life-threatening events such as these are not uncommon in infants and an underlying diagnosis is not often found.</p></div>

This difference is due to the reports of vomiting (p=0.024; 4 patients in the younger age group versus no patients in the older age group). In the lower age group, one patient was in the 0.6 mg/kg treatment and three were in the 1.2 mg/kg treatment group.

Twelve of these patients had PCI prolonged (&gt;84 ms) QRS intervals and one had PCI short QRS intervals; one of the patients with a prolonged QRS also had a PCI prolonged PR interval. Of the 12 patients with a PCI prolonged QRS interval, 9 had a PCI prolonged QRS interval at screening. In three patients the QRS interval of PCI was prolonged only after treatment with pantoprazole (two of these patients the QRS was borderline PCI prolonged [82 ms and 83 ms] at baseline). Comment: As the majority of the PCI ECG abnormalities were seen as baseline, there is likely no causal association between QRS prolongation and treatment with pantoprazole.</p><p>One patient (334-017-001241) had an ECG finding that was reported to show a clinically significant abnormality. This patient's screening ECG finding was assessed as normal on overall evaluation, whereas the final study ECG finding was reported as showing right ventricular hypertrophy that was considered to be a clinically significant abnormality on an overall evaluation. A follow-up echocardiogram, performed 50 days later, showed no evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy. The patient had no history of cardiac problems and had no abnormalities on physical examination either at screening or at the final evaluation, the day the abnormal ECG was recorded. Comment: Given the results of the negative echo, it is difficult to interpret the significance of the abnormal ECG reading at the final study visit.</p></div>

Mean height increased from baseline to the final visit in both treatment groups. The mean height increased by 1.2 cm in the low-dose treatment group (p=0.060) and by 1.3 cm in the high-dose treatment group (p=0.004); the between-group comparison of the mean change in height was not statistically significant. There were no significant changes from baseline within each dose or significant differences between dose groups in z-scores for weight, height, weight-for-height (ages 1-5), or BMI (ages 2-11) indicating that the growth seen in these patients was as expected for children of their ages.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographics</head><p>The study population consisted of 10 male and 12 female adolescents, aged 12 to 16 years (mean age 14.4 years), with a clinical diagnosis of suspected GERD, symptomatic GERD, or endoscopically-proven GERD.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Evaluation</head><p>Adverse Events A total of six patients had TEAEs, two (18%) patients in the 20-mg dose group and four (36%) patients in the 40-mg dose group. The only TEAE reported in more than one patient was abdominal pain, which was reported for two (18.2%) patients in the higher 40-mg dose group; these events were considered mild in severity and not related to pantoprazole.</p><p>One 14-year-old male patient in the 40-mg dose group (337-008-000711) had nausea and fever which were considered mild in severity and related to pantoprazole. The nausea and the fever resolved after one day and 11 days, respectively. Patient 337-003-00561, a 16-year-old female patient in the 20-mg dose group, developed reflux symptoms on the final day of the study, 24 hours after her last dose of pantoprazole. The symptoms were considered mild in severity and not related to pantoprazole.</p><p>Comment: There is no statistically significant difference between the two dose groups in the incidence of any reported TEAE or in the reported TEAEs overall.

Four of these six patients had PCI values at screening, and only two patients had PCI values which were treatment emergent (+urine albumin, +urine hemoglobin), neither was determined to be of clinical significance. Vital Signs: There were no vital sign PCI abnormalities during the treatment period.</p><p>Growth Parameters: The mean change in height from screening to the final evaluation within the dose groups was 0.4 cm and 1.1 cm for the 20-and 40-mg dose groups, respectively. These changes were not statistically significant in either dose group. There were no statistically significant differences between dose groups. The mean change in weight from screening to the final evaluation within the dose groups was 0.80 kg (± 0.21) and 0.36 kg (± 0.20) for the 20-and 40-mg dose groups, respectively.</p><p>ECG: A total of three patients (14%) had ECG PCI findings, two patients in the 20-mg treatment group and one patient in the 40-mg treatment group. In all three patients the PCI findings occurred on the screening ECG which all normalized by end of treatment, thus none are thought to be treatment related.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Pantoprazole molecular structure depicted.................................................................... 15 Figure 2: Kaplan-Meier Plot of Time to Lack of Efficacy per Withdrawal Criteria .................... 35 Figure 3: Box plot of WGSS Baseline and Final Week for mITT from Wyeth (Trial 328)......... 36 Figure 4: Scatter Plot of Change in WGSS from Baseline to Final Week vs Baseline WGSS (Trial 328) ..................................................................................................................................... 37 Figure 5: Box plot of CSS at Baseline and Week 8 (Trial 322) ................................................... 39 Figure 6: Scatter plot of change in CSS from Baseline to Week 8 vs. Baseline (Trial 322) ........ 40 Figure 7: Box Plot of CSS at Baseline and Week 8 (Trial 326) ................................................... 41 Figure 8: Scatter Plot of Change in CSS from Baseline to Week 8 vs. Baseline CSS (Trial 326)41 Figure 9: AUC vs. Weight and Age.............................................................................................. 49 Figure 10: Patient Disposition (Trial 329) .................................................................................... 75 Figure 11: Mean WGSS During Open-Label Run-In Phase (Trial 329) ...................................... 80 Figure 12: Mean WGSS During DB Phase by Treatment (Trial 329).......................................... 81 Figure 13: Changes from Baseline in WGSS by Individual Component (Trial 329)................... 81 Figure 14: Pantoprazole Strength Based on Age Group............................................................... 97 Figure 15: WGSS at Baseline and Final Week for All Doses (Trial 328).................................. 105 Figure 16: WGSS Changes from Baseline by Individual Components (Trial 328) ................... 107 Figure 17: Patient Disposition (Trial 322) .................................................................................. 126 Figure 18: Disposition of Patients (Trial 326) ............................................................................ 151 : GASP-Q..................................................................................................................... 166Figure 19</figDesc></figure>

In both cases, the PCI AP levels occurred at the end of the double-blind phase in patients who had received continued treatment with pantoprazole 1Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT): A PCI high ALT level was observed in one patient (329-049-001442). This patient had a non-PCI high ALT level at screening, which was unchanged at the end of four weeks of treatment with open label pantoprazole.

Release Oral Suspension/Protonix Delayed-Release Tablet (pantoprazole sodium) Comment: The abnormal vital signs are mostly reported at screening and non-sustained.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. General Design and Objective</head><p>Study 3001B3-331-WW (Study 331) is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, single-dose and multiple-dose trial to assess PK, clinical GERD, respiratory symptoms, and safety of two dose levels of pantoprazole (1.25 mg and 2.5 mg), and the PD at one dose level <ref type="bibr">(2.5 mg)</ref> in neonates and preterm infants with a clinical indication for acid suppression to treat a presumed diagnosis of GERD. All patients received five days of treatment. Patients were neonates and preterm infants that had been admitted to an NICU or special care nursery prior to enrollment.</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to determine whether consistent exposures to pantoprazole in neonates and preterm infants with presumed GERD could be achieved by using oral doses of pantoprazole.</p><p>Secondary objectives of the study were:</p><p>1. To characterize the PK of oral pantoprazole after a single dose and at steady state when consistent exposures are achieved in neonates and preterm infants with presumed GERD at doses expected to produce exposures similar to those achieved in older children and adults given standard doses of pantoprazole. 2. To provide the PD assessment of oral pantoprazole at baseline and steady state by using pH-metry to measure intragastric and intraesophageal pH in neonates and preterm infants with presumed GERD. 3. To characterize the change from baseline in clinical GERD and respiratory symptoms after single and multiple doses of oral pantoprazole have been administered to neonates and infants with presumed GERD. 4. To describe the safety of pantoprazole in neonates and preterm infants with presumed GERD throughout the study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Treatment</head><p>Pantoprazole delayed-release granules were provided in an inert powder blend in foil pouches in 1.25-and 2.5-mg dose strengths. At the time of administration, 2.5 mL of water was added to the content of the foil pouch to form a grape-flavored suspension. The appropriate doses were then administered to patients by using an oral syringe approximately 30 minutes before the first feeding each day at approximately the same time as on study day 1. Dose administration via NG tube was prohibited. Feeding began approximately 30 minutes after dose administration. Doses of 1.25 and 2.5 mg correspond to 0.6 to 1.2 mg/kg, respectively. The labeled dose in adults is 40 mg, which corresponds to approximately 0.5 to 0.6 mg/kg. infants under one year of age, but these symptoms have not been systematically described in the medical literature.</p><p>PK Endpoints 1. Plasma concentrations of pantoprazole were determined after single and multiple-dose administration. 2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H. Data Analysis</head><p>Statistical Analytical Plan Patients were summarized by age groups (preterm versus full term) and CYP genotypes to explore PK results. Exploratory presentations for subpopulations or subgroups were prepared after final presentation of planned statistical analyses was completed for the entire study population. Because of the limited size of the study population, these exploratory analyses are presented only as additional descriptive information.</p><p>Baseline demographics, disease characteristics, and other background medical history information of the safety population were summarized to evaluate comparability. The Fisher exact test was used for variables reported as nominal attributes. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with treatment as a factor in the model was used for continuous variables such as age, corrected age, weight, length and head circumference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Analysis</head><p>All AEs, TEAEs, PCI laboratory test results, PCI vital sign measurements, and PCI ECG results were summarized by dose group. The Fisher exact test was used to compare all AEs and TEAEs between dose groups. The frequencies of PCI laboratory test results, vital sign measurements, and ECG results were summarized. Continuous safety parameters were analyzed using ANCOVA with treatment as a factor and baseline value as a covariate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Pharmacokinetics</head><p>The concentration values were highly variable after single and multiple doses of pantoprazole in this study population. Exposures observed with the 2.5-mg dose were slightly higher compared with that of adults who received 40-mg doses.</p><p>The half-life of pantoprazole appeared to be longer in neonates and preterm infants, compared with that seen in adults and children aged 1 through 16 years. The mean apparent total clearance normalized to body weight was similar to that of adults and children aged 6 through 16 years but lower than that of infants aged 1 through 11 months and children aged 1 through 5 years.</p><p>There was no evidence of accumulation after multiple doses of pantoprazole.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Symptom Evaluation</head><p>Based on the analyses of GERD and respiratory symptom frequency, pantoprazole treatment resulted in some clinical improvements in this patient population; however, improvement did not reach the 0.05 level of significance, as follows:</p><p>In the 1.25-mg dose group, the total daily GERD symptom score decreased from a mean of 3.26 at baseline to 2.19 at the last day on therapy (p=0.107). In the 2.5-mg dose group, the total daily GERD symptom score improved from 2.94 at baseline to 2.17 at the last day on therapy (p=0.054). These data include all patients (PK, PK/PD, and PD) with only a clinical diagnosis of GERD. These clinical outcome results are based on a short term study with no control and should be considered exploratory. The clinical meaningfulness of the decrease in symptom score seen in either treatment group is questionable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Safety</head><p>Based on the analysis of patient safety data, daily doses of pantoprazole (1.25 mg to 2.5 mg) were relatively safe in neonates and preterm infants with a clinical diagnosis of GERD. AEs were reported in 30 (51%) of 59 patients. TEAEs were reported in 5 (26%) of 19 patients in the 1.25-mg dose group and in 18 (45%) of 40 patients in the 2.5-mg dose group; the difference between groups was not significant. No patients were withdrawn from the study because of AEs and no deaths occurred. There were two reports of SAEs, both of which occurred in the follow-up period of the study and were not related to pantoprazole in the opinion of the investigators. One patient had a urinary tract infection and the other had hematochezia.</p><p>The most frequently reported TEAE was anemia, which occurred in 5 (9%) patients. Other TEAEs occurring in at least 5% of patients were hypoxia, rhinitis, and constipation. PCI laboratory test result abnormalities were common at baseline and decreased over the period of the study. There were no clear dose-related abnormalities identified. The patients grew in weight, length, and head circumference during the study.</p><p>This was the only study done for the PWR in the neonates and preterm NICU population. These infants have confounding complexities given their population. Without a placebo group, it is difficult to ascertain which adverse events are most likely due to study drug versus prematurity or disease process that has caused them to be in the NICU. In general, the drug appears to be well tolerated.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Background</head><p>The PROTONIX PWR requires a PK, exposure/response, and safety study in pediatric patients 1 through 11 years of age with endoscopically proven GERD in Study 4. This current study was designed to meet this requirement. In the age &lt; six years/spheroid group, 11 of 17 (65%) patients had one or more TEAEs: 4 of 7 patients in the low-dose group and 7 of 10 patients in the high-dose group. Six specific AEs were reported as TEAEs in two or more patients. The following were reported: diarrhea and vomiting (4); and abdominal pain, accidental injury, nausea, and cough increased (2 each). All of the TEAEs reported in the low-dose group were assessed as mild or moderate in severity by the reporting investigators. Safety Results: The TEAE reported by the highest number of patients was abdominal pain. The incidence of TEAEs in the digestive system and the incidence of vomiting were significantly higher among children ages &lt; six-years than in children ages ≥ six-years. Of note, vomiting related to GERD is also more common in younger children. Among patients ages ≥ six-years, the overall incidence of respiratory system TEAEs was higher in the low-dose group than in the high-dose group. These represented a variety of common diseases in childhood, reflecting no pattern or dose relationship. No deaths, SAEs, or withdrawal due to TEAE occurred during the course of this study.</p></div>

General Design and Objective</head><p>Study 3001A3-337-US (Study 337) is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, single-and multiple-dose PK study in adolescents aged 12 through 16 years with GERD. There were two dose groups (20-mg and 40-mg tablets), with each subject receiving 5 to 11 doses of pantoprazole. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 fashion to the 20-or 40-mg treatment groups. Single-dose PK analysis was performed after the first dose of pantoprazole. Multipledose PK values were assessed on day 8 (± 3 days) of pantoprazole administration after the last of at least five consecutive doses. Because patients were to be provided with a 14-day supply of pantoprazole, if a patient missed a dose, that patient could restart accumulating a run of five consecutive doses. Safety evaluations were performed on an ongoing basis by review of adverse events (AEs) and clinically important laboratory test results as described in the PWR.</p><p>The primary objective of the study was to characterize the PK profile of single and repeated oral doses of pantoprazole in adolescents aged 12 through 16 years with a clinical diagnosis of suspected GERD, symptomatic GERD, or endoscopically-proven GERD.

There is no obvious reason for this increase in the patients triglycerides while on test article. It was confirmed that a four hour fast was completed prior to the collection of the screening labs and a three hour fast prior to the final evaluation lab tests.
