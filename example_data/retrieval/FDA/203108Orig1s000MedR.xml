<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Executive Summary</head><p>The recommended regulatory action for this NDA resubmission is Approval for the long-term once daily maintenance bronchodilator treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis and emphysema at a dose of 5mcg once daily. A Complete Response action was taken during the initial review cycle as manufacturing and testing facilities associated with the drug substance and drug product did not receive an acceptable GMP recommendation from the Office of Compliance, which precluded approval. This was despite adequate clinical data to support the safety and efficacy of Olodaterol inhalation solution and a Pulmonary Allergy Drug Advisory Committee meeting where the vote was 15 to 1 supporting approval. In this resubmission, the sponsor has included a safety update summarizing safety data from two 12-week trials. The additional safety information contained in the safety update does not alter the risk/benefit assessment of olodaterol. The manufacturing issues have been resolved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background</head><p>Boehringer-Ingelheim has resubmitted their NDA for olodaterol inhalation solution (Olo) following a Complete Response (CR) action taken on 3/14/13. The CR action was taken as manufacturing and testing facilities associated with the drug substance and drug product did not receive an acceptable GMP recommendation from the Office of Compliance. This precluded approval in the initial review cycle, despite adequate clinical data to support the safety and efficacy of Olo for its proposed indication. This application was also discussed a Pulmonary Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee (PADAC) meeting held on 1/29/13. The PADAC vote 15 to 1 favoring approval. As there was adequate clinical evidence of safety/efficacy and given the PADAC discussion, despite the manufacturing issues, labeling negotiations were conducted and were near completion at the time of the CR action. The label included in the CR letter represented the Division final edits on the document and incorporated input from labeling consultants. Support for efficacy and safety was derived primarily from the four parallel group 48week COPD trials, two of which were conducted primarily in the United States (US) and two of which were conducted primarily in Europe (EU). These trials included a total of 3104 patients, 1759 of which were exposed to Olo (mean exposure approximately 300 days). These trials shared the same spirometric co-primary endpoints of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) AUC (0-3 hours) response and trough FEV1 response. The difference for Olo 5mcg from placebo for FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) response in trials 1222.11, 1222.12, 1222.13, and 1222.14 were 0.164, 0.134, 0.151, and 0.129L (all p-values &lt;0.0001), respectively. For trough FEV1 response, the differences from placebo were 0.084 (p=0.0002), 0.033 (p&gt;0.05), 0.078 (p=0.0002), and 0.053L (p=0.006), respectively. No safety signals were identified based on analysis of the four 48-week trials. For in depth discussion</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Safety Update</head><p>The two trials included in the safety update (1222.51 and 1222.52) were replicate 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trials in patients with moderate to severe COPD. The trials included two treatment arms which were as follows:</p><p>1) Olo 5mcg via Respimat device co-administered with tiotropium Handihaler (THH). Referred to as T+O. 2) Placebo via Respimat co-administered with THH. Referred to as T+PBO.</p><p>The trial consisted of a screening (2-weeks), treatment (12-weeks), and follow-up period (3-weeks). The co-primary endpoints were FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) and trough FEV1 response at week 12 of treatment. Safety monitoring included physical exam, adverse events, ECG, pregnancy testing, and clinical labs.</p><p>In these trials, a total of 1134 and 1133 patients were included in the T+PBO and T+O treatment arms, respectively. Mean exposure in both groups was approximately 84 days. Demographic and baseline data were similar between treatment groups and were typical for a COPD trial. The majority of patients were male (52%), white (91%), GOLD stage II (59%) with a mean age of 64 years and mean FEV1 of 46% predicted.</p><p>There were 11 deaths in these trials, 3 (0.3%) in the T+PBO treatment arm and 8 (0.7%) in the T+O treatment arm. The causes of death were typical for a COPD trial. The most common cause of death was in the cardiac disorder system organ class (SOC). Based on SOC and PT, there were small numerical differences when comparing treatment groups. However, the differences were small and the events were relatively rare. Causes of death are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.  Serious adverse events (SAE) occurred in 117 (5.7%) patients and were more common in the T+O group [n=64 (5.6%)] compared to T+PBO group [n=53 (4.7%)]. The types of SAEs were typical for a COPD trial. SAEs occurred most commonly in the respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal system organ class (SOC). SAEs in the cardiac disorder and vascular disorder SOCs were numerically more common in the T+O group compared to T+PBO groups. While there were some differences between treatment groups, they were generally small and the overall numbers were small. 0 (0.0) 2 (0.2) 2 (0.1) Gastroenteritis 1 (0.1) 1 (0.1) 2 (0.1) Metabolism and nutrition disorders 1 (0.1) 1 (0.1) 2 (0.1) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 20 (1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">8)</ref> 18 (1.6) 38 (1.7) Acute respiratory failure 0 (0.0) 5 (0.4) 5 (0.2) Pulmonary hypertension 1 (0.1) 1 (0.1) 2 (0.1) Respiratory failure 1 (0.1) 1 (0.1) 2 (0.1) Gastrointestinal disorders 5 (0.4) 7 (0.6) 12 (0.5) Gastritis 1 (0.1) 1 (0.1) 2 (0.1) Intestinal obstruction 1 (0.1) 1 (0.1) 2 (0.1) Esophagitis 1 (0.1) 1 (0.1) 2 (0.1) <ref type="bibr">Renal</ref>  Common adverse events (≥2% by treatment) were typical of what would be expected in a COPD trial. Approximately 43% of patients reported AEs. Overall, these were balanced between treatment groups. The most common AE by preferred term was COPD (10.7%), followed by dry mouth (2.7%). These are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. Overall, the types of adverse events reported in the pooled analysis were typical of what would be expected in this patient population. While there were some numerical for asthma may lead to more peril in seeking approval for this indication. However, past experience in these develop programs has informed us that the dose and dosing interval are the same in either disease. Traditionally in the past, dose-ranging trials were performed in subjects with asthma due to their greater airway sensitivity response to adrenergic activation which is necessary to establish separation of dose responses. Once a dose was determined in those with asthma, that dose was carried forward into COPD trials. As such it is important to perform at least some dose-selection trials in subjects with asthma. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The NDA for olodaterol demonstrated efficacy with safety expected for a LABA, when used as a bronchodilator in patients with COPD. The efficacy and safety demonstrated seems in line with other agents that are currently marketed. The sponsor is also seeking unique claims for increased exercise tolerance. DPARP has concluded and recommends that the sponsor has not provided evidence of efficacy that would support increased exercise tolerance claims. DPARP does recommend that the sponsor has provided enough evidence to support approval for the indication listed above (typical COPD indication) but is recommending that this application receive a complete response at present because there is a withhold recommendation from compliance in relation to general GMP inspection at the main manufacturing site. While this may not reflect any specific findings for this product, it may represent a failure of the Quality System for the site which will receive a warning letter for inadequate GMPs by the Office of Compliance.</p><p>I agree with the recommendations of DPARP. I will discuss my reasoning and conclusions below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy</head><p>The sponsor submitted many trials in subjects with COPD. Unique to this application was the sponsor's desire to have a claim of improvement in exercise endurance in patients with COPD. I will discuss these trials (1222.37 and 1222.38) separately.</p><p>Below is a table from Dr. Chowdhury's review summarizing the efficacy results for the COPD trials. The mean treatment effect across trials for trough FEV1 was 65mL. As the other reviewers note, this is somewhat less than was demonstrated for other agents, but is most likely due to the allowance for continued COPD background treatments (except LABAs). The response demonstrated for olodaterol is similar to that of formoterol. Olodaterol doses of 5 and 10 mcg were both effective and had similar responses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exercise endurance:</head><p>The sponsor proposes to include exercise endurance benefit based on the results of exercise testing. This would be a novel claim for COPD that has not been presented to, or considered by, the agency previously. Below from Dr. Chowdhury's review are the results of two trials. This table demonstrates that those subjects receiving olodaterol did on average have longer exercise times. However, the increases in exercise time was 40-50 seconds (12-14%) above the average baseline (354 seconds to 370 seconds). Presently, there is not a recognized minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for exercise testing. There also has not been any correlation demonstrated defining the magnitude of increase in exercise tolerance that corresponds to improvement in activities of daily living. For these trials, exercise testing was performed 2 hours post-dose, corresponding to peak bronchodilator effect and there wasn't any evaluation for persistence of effect or evaluation at timepoints greater than six weeks.</p><p>Finally, the mechanism of action of olodaterol is the same as other beta-agonists used in COPD and one might predict the other agents to have the same effect. It does seem that the sponsor is proposing a new, novel claim, without developing the supporting evidence of what should be expected as the criteria to support such an indication or with any idea if this is something novel for their product that really warrants identification in labeling. Also, the effect of olodaterol in this regard is probably not unique compared to other LABAs, which may be seen as efforts to find a marketing tool instead of a unique benefit worthy of differentiation. In any event, I do not feel they have demonstrated a unique and clinically important difference worthy of labeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety</head><p>The major safety concern with LABAs, at least in those with asthma, is severe asthma exacerbations and asthma-related deaths. These effects appear dose-related, making dose selection for efficacy to afford the optimal risk for benefit the primary consideration. While these risks have not been demonstrated in those with COPD it still would seem to be reasonable not to market an unnecessarily high dose. As such, and because there did not seem to be separation between the 5 and 10 mcg doses, the sponsor's proposal to pursue the 5 mcg dose is appropriate.</p><p>There balanced events between olodaterol and placebo for deaths and SAEs. There was a small imbalance in neoplasm. But this was based on limited events making any conclusions impossible. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Overall the safety profile is similar to other drugs of the same class and acceptable for marketing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advisory Committee Meeting</head><p>A meeting of the Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee (PADAC) was held on January 29, 2013. The committee voted 15-yes, 1-no and 1 abstain that there was substantial evidence of efficacy, and also voted 15-yes, 1-no and 1 abstain that the safety of olodaterol was appropriate. The committee voted 15-yes, 1-no and 1 abstain that olodaterol should be approved for marketing.</p><p>Regarding a non-voting question requesting the discussion of the evidence to support an exercise endurance claim, most panel members noted that more information was needed to understand optimal exercise trial design for COPD and clinically important exercise improvement and endpoints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and Recommendations</head><p>The benefit and risk assessment is appropriate to allow marketing of olodaterol inhalation spray at 5 mcg once daily for long-term maintenance bronchodilator treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD, including bronchitis and emphysema. The sponsor will need to respond to the GMP issues that resulted in a withhold recommendation. Until that time I recommend a Complete Response action.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) submitted this 505(b)(1) new drug application for use of Striverdi Respimat (olodaterol inhalation spray) for long-term once-daily maintenance bronchodilator treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. The proposed dose is 5 mcg of olodaterol (two actuations of 2.5 mcg per actuation) once-daily, recommended to be taken at the same time each day. The application is based on clinical efficacy and safety studies. This summary review will provide an overview of the application, with a focus on the clinical efficacy and safety studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background</head><p>There are several drug classes available for the relief of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD. These include beta-2 adrenergic agonists, anticholinergic agents, combination products containing beta-2 adrenergic agonists and anticholinergic agents, combination of long-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonists and corticosteroids, and methylxanthines.</p><p>Olodaterol is a new molecular entity that belongs to the class called beta-2 adrenergic agonists. Due to its longer duration of action, olodaterol belongs to the subclass called long-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonists (LABAs). Inhaled LABAs are widely used in the United States and worldwide to treat bronchospasm in patients with asthma and COPD. LABAs currently marketed in the United States include salmeterol, formoterol, arformoterol, and indacaterol. Some of these are marketed as single ingredient products and others as combination products with inhaled corticosteroids. Salmeterol, formoterol, Study 1222.4 was a crossover, single dose, dose-ranging trial in patients with intermittent asthma. Patients were randomized to receive a sequence of single doses of various doses of olodaterol and placebo <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1</ref>). Following administration of study medication patients received a series of methacholine challenges. The primary endpoint was the provocative concentration of methacholine required to cause a 20% fall in FEV1 from baseline [Log 2 (PC20 FEV1)] at 24 hours following treatment. This is not an acceptable method of dose-ranging study; therefore, this study will not be discussed further in this review.</p><p>Study 1222.6 was a parallel arm, multiple dose, dose-ranging study in patients with asthma (FEV1≥60% and &lt;90% predicted). Study 1222.27 was a crossover, multiple dose, dose-ranging study in patients with asthma who were on ICS and were still symptomatic. Study 1222.29 was a crossover, multiple dose, dose-regimen study in patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma. Various treatment arms and primary and secondary efficacy variables for the studies are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Dose ranging (1222.3, and 1222.5) and dose regimen (1222.26) studies in patients with COPD: Study 1222.3 was a crossover, single dose, dose-ranging study in patients with COPD. For inclusion in the trial, patients were required to have an FEV1 ≤60% predicted and demonstrate airway reversibility following albuterol administration (≥12% improvement). Study 1222.5 was a parallel arm, multiple-dose, dose-ranging study in patients with COPD. Patients were required to have an FEV1 ≥30% and &lt;80% predicted. Study 1222.26 was a crossover, multiple-dose, dose regimen study in patients with moderate to severe stable COPD. Various treatment arms and primary and secondary efficacy variables for the studies are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Pivotal 48-week studies in patients with COPD (1222.11, 1222.12, 1222.13, and 1222.14):</p><p>Studies 1222.11 and 1222.12 were identical in design. These were parallel group studies conducted in patients with COPD with FEV1 of &lt;80% predicted, FEV1/FVC ratio of &lt;70% predicted, and with at least a 10 pack year smoking history. Patients with asthma were excluded. These studies allowed standard of care background therapy with short-acting beta-agonists, inhaled corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, anticholinergics (including tiotropium), and methylxanthines in all treatment groups. Study treatment arms and primary and secondary efficacy variables are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. Safety assessments included adverse event recording, vital signs, physical examination, clinical laboratory and hematology measures, ECGs, and Holter monitoring in a subset of patients.</p><p>Studies 1222.13 and 1222.14 were also identical in design. The studies were similar in design to 1222.11 and 1222.12 except for the addition of an active comparator arm of formoterol and inclusion of additional endpoints related to dyspnea and quality of life. These studies also allowed standard of care background therapy. Study treatment arms and primary and secondary efficacy variables are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. Safety assessments included adverse event recording, vital signs, physical examination, clinical laboratory and hematology measures, and ECGs. Spirometry profiling 6-week studies in patients with COPD (1222.24, 1222.25, 1222.39, and 1222.40):</p><p>Studies 1222.24 and 1222.25 were identical studies conducted to characterize the 24-hour FEV time profile of olodaterol. These were cross-over studies conducted in patients with COPD with FEV1≤80% predicted. The studies included formoterol as an active comparator. Studies 1222.39 and 1222.40 were similar to studies 1222.24 and 1222.25 except that they included tiotropium as active comparator. Study treatment arms and primary and secondary efficacy variables are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. In studies 1222.24 and 1222.25, patients were permitted to continue long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs); however, LABAs were prohibited. In studies 1222.39 and 1222.40, both LABAs and LAMAs were prohibited. Exercise endurance 6-week studies in patients with COPD (1222.37 and 1222.38):</p><p>Studies 1222.37 and 1222.38 were identical in design conducted to assess exercise endurance response of olodaterol. These were crossover studies conducted in patients with moderate to severe COPD with an exercise endurance time of at least 25 minutes at baseline. Patients were allowed to take ICS, methylxanthines, and short acting anticholinergics during the trial. However, LABAs and tiotropium were not permitted. Study treatment arms and primary and secondary efficacy variables are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. Endurance time was assessed by constant rate cycle ergometry to symptom limitation at 75% maximal work capacity. Isotime was defined as the endurance time of constant work rate exercise of shortest duration at 75% maximal work capacity. Intensity of breathing discomfort as measured by the Borg Scale at isotime.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>c. Efficacy findings and conclusions</head><p>The clinical program showed that olodaterol 5 mcg and 10 mcg once-daily doses (two actuations of 2.5 mcg per actuation) provided a statistically significant bronchodilatory effect compared to placebo in patients with COPD, with replicate findings for both doses.</p><p>There were no statistically significant differences between the olodaterol 5 mcg and 10 mcg doses. The olodaterol 5 mcg and 10 mcg once-daily doses also demonstrated a statistically significant difference in exercise endurance measures compared to placebo in patients with COPD; however, the effect sizes were small and the effect was only assessed at peak bronchodilatory effect time point and at 6 weeks. The submitted data support approval of BI's proposed dose of olodaterol 5 mcg once-daily as a bronchodilator treatment in patients with COPD, but do not support an exercise endurance claim for olodaterol.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dose ranging and dose regimen:</head><p>As discussed in section 2 above, selection of appropriate dose and dosing regimen is an important consideration for development of LABAs, and these studies need to be conducted in patients with asthma in addition to COPD because the bronchodilator response is greater in bronchoresponsive patients, such as patients with asthma who can show larger separation between doses. BI conducted adequate exploration of dose ranges and dose regimens in patients with asthma and COPD <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>. In dose ranging studies conducted, olodaterol doses from 2 mcg to 20 mcg were explored, both in patients with asthma and COPD. In these studies olodaterol 5 mcg and 10 mcg doses produced adequate bronchodilator response, the 20 mcg dose did not appear to produce further benefit, and the 2 mcg dose appeared to be suboptimal (results from two representative studies are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 1</ref>). In dose regimen studies olodaterol 5 mcg and 10 mcg once daily doses were compared to similar total daily nominal doses given twice daily, both in patients with asthma and in COPD. In the asthma study, a small numerical benefit of twice daily dose over once daily dose was seen, but the benefit was small and seen in the second half of the 24-hour dosing interval, which was not sufficient to favor a twice daily dosing for olodaterol (data not shown in this review). The COPD study did not show benefit of twice daily dose over once daily dose ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 2</ref>). These data support once daily dosing regimen for olodaterol. Based on these studies, and with Agency concurrence, BI selected olodaterol 5 mcg and 10 mcg once daily doses for further evaluation in confirmatory COPD studies. Inclusion of two doses in confirmatory COPD studies provides additional dose response information for both efficacy and safety and further informs dose selection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bronchodilator effects:</head><p>The results for the primary efficacy variables for the 48-week COPD studies are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. For ease of comparison, data from week 12 are shown for all studies, although the primary efficacy endpoints for studies 1222.13 and 1222.14 were at week 24. The results show that olodaterol 5 mcg once daily and 10 mcg once daily doses were statistically significantly superior to placebo for the primary endpoints with the exception of study 1222.12 in which the 5 mcg olodaterol group was not significant for trough FEV1. Results at weeks 24 and 48 were generally comparable to results at week 12. Comparison of the two doses of olodaterol shows that the 5 mcg and 10 mcg were generally similar (Table 2, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>). Olodaterol had a fairly rapid onset of bronchodilator effect after first dose, and the bronchodilator effect was sustained over 12 weeks, with a numerical trend of a blunted peak effect at week 12 that may be due to tachyphylaxis often seen with beta-agonists ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> the box on the top panel shows the onset of effect after first dose, and the box on the bottom panel shows shift of baseline after 12 weeks of treatment that possibly reflects the bronchodilator effect from the previous dose. The 6-week studies, which profiled FEV1 over 24 hours, showed a bronchodilator effect of olodaterol over the 24-hour dosing interval, and responses were comparable with two active comparators ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>). Based on these data, along with dose ranging data, BI proposed a 5 mcg once daily dose for marketing approval, which is reasonable.</p><p>The observed effect size for olodaterol across studies appeared to be smaller than that observed in previous registration trials for other LABAs for COPD. The mean treatment effect across trials for trough FEV1 was 65 mL. For FEV1 AUC 0-3hr the mean treatment effect across trials was 155mL. The smaller treatment effects were possibly due to the olodaterol study design that allowed for patients to continue COPD background treatments, except for LABAs, which was not the case in previous COPD development programs. In studies where formoterol was included as an active comparator, the treatment effect of olodaterol was generally comparable to the observed treatment effect of formoterol (Table 2, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>).</p><p>Olodaterol 5 mcg demonstrated a bronchodilatory treatment effect at 5 minutes after the first dose with a mean increase in FEV1 compared to placebo f 110 mL (range 100 to 120 mL).    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SGRQ:</head><p>BI initially proposed to include SGRQ claims in the proposed label based on results from studies 1222.13 and 1222.14, but later in the review cycle submitted a revised label removing SGRQ claims. In one of the two studies, a statistically significant difference of 3.15 in mean total SGRQ scores was observed between olodaterol 5 mcg and placebo, which is below the threshold of the minimally important difference (MID) of -4 units or more for the SGRQ total score. The MCID of -4 for SGRQ has support in the literature. <ref type="bibr">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">15</ref> Exercise endurance:</p><p>BI proposes to include exercise endurance claims in the proposed label based on results of improvement in exercise endurance time, and reduced lung hyperinflation (decreased in functional residual capacity or FRC) resulting in increased inspiratory capacity (IC) from two 6-week studies ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1)</ref>. Results of the two studies show statistically significant differences between olodaterol and placebo for these measures <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 3)</ref>; however, clinical interpretation of statistical significance is not straightforward for variety of reasons. First, the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for exercise endurance in drug trials in patients with COPD is unknown. Clinical studies evaluating effects of pulmonary rehabilitation suggest that the MCID may be around a101-153 second improvement from baseline (34%) 16,17 . However, these results are not universally accepted or validated, and it is unclear if the results in pulmonary rehabilitation would also pertain to drug trials. For inspiratory capacity, the MCID is likewise unknown. Second, the relationship between a magnitude of effect demonstrated in the olodaterol studies to any activity of daily living that relates to exercise in COPD patients is not known. Third, exercise testing was performed approximately 2 hours post-dose, which correspond to the time at which the bronchodilator effect of olodaterol has reached its peak. It is not known if the benefit with olodaterol would persist later in the dosing period. Fourth, studies lasting for 6 weeks are not adequate to show sustainability of effect. For comparison, studies to show bronchodilator efficacy are at least 12 weeks in duration, and studies to show exacerbation efficacy are 6 to 12 months in duration. Finally, no other bronchodilator drugs approved for COPD in the Unites States has an exercise endurance claim, and these products potentially could show similar numerical changes if studied. The pharmacological effect of olodaterol is likely to be similar to other beta-agonists. <ref type="bibr">14</ref>  The proposed wordings for inclusion of an exercise claim in the Clinical Trials section of olodaterol product label are not supported by the submitted data. To support such labeling claim, reasonable expectation would be that olodaterol treatment demonstrates a benefit in some exercise related activity of daily living in COPD patients, or a benefit in exercise endurance test based measures with effect sizes that cross accepted MCIDs. In either scenario, the benefit will need to be demonstrated at various relevant time points of the day after dosing, and over at least 6 months of treatment. Lack of accepted MCIDs for exercise endurance test based measures makes studies challenging. Development of MCIDs for such measure will likely need linking the measures to some exercise related activity of daily living in COPD patients. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Safety</head><p>a. Safety database The safety assessment of olodaterol is based primarily on studies shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. A total of 3353 patients with COPD and a total of 731 patients with asthma were exposed to olodaterol in various studies. Of the COPD patients, 3142 were exposed to olodaterol 5 mcg or 10 mcg in parallel group or cross-over studies. The 48-week parallel group studies included a total of 3104 patients, of whom 1759 patients were exposed to olodaterol 5 mcg or 10 mcg. The safety database for olodaterol was reasonable. Given that the 5 mcg dose is proposed for marketing, the 10 mcg dose provides important supporting safety data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>b. Safety findings and conclusion</head><p>The submitted data support safety of olodaterol for use as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD at a dose of 5 mcg once daily.</p><p>A major safety concern with LABAs is linked to selection of an appropriate dose, because beta-2 adrenergic bronchodilators, particularly at high doses, have the safety concerns of severe asthma exacerbations and asthma-related deaths in patients who use these drugs to treat the symptoms of asthma. Although such a risk of worsening disease has not been shown in COPD, it is nevertheless important to select an appropriate and safe dose for all bronchodilators, including olodaterol, which is proposed to be marketed for COPD. Marketing an unnecessary and unreasonably high dose has safety concerns. BI conduced adequate dose ranging and dose regimen studies and selected 5 mcg and 10 mcg once daily doses for pivotal confirmatory studies. Of the two doses, BI is proposing to market the lower 5 mcg dose because there was no separation between the two doses. This is a very reasonable strategy from a safety perspective. Safety data from the asthma program, though limited, did not show a signal of severe asthma exacerbation. The safety findings noted in the COPD program were not concerning and typical of betaagonist bronchodilators.</p><p>BI conducted a comprehensive safety analysis of the available data. Safety analysis included evaluation of deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs 18 ), adverse events (AEs), and also specific analyses of Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) endpoints a respiratory adverse events. All deaths and SAEs were adjudicated by independent committees. BI also collected vital status information out to 337 + 14 days (50 weeks) for patients who discontinued from the studies. Overall, vital status data are available for 98% of all patients randomized in the 48-week trials. Safety data from the 48-week studies were most informative. nd A total of 53 on-treatment deaths were reported in the 48-week studies. These were balanced among the treatment groups. Common causes of deaths included COPD exacerbation, respiratory failure, and pneumonia, which are expected causes of death in older COPD patients. A total of 499 patients with SAEs (fatal and non-fatal) were reported in the 48-week studies. There were also balanced among the treatment causes, and the events were typical and expected in COPD patients. The number of deaths and SAEs in other studies was also balanced and did not raise any concerns.</p><p>There was a small imbalance in the olodaterol 10 mcg group compared to placebo for neoplasms, primarily lung-related malignancies. Overall, there were 9 (1.0%), 14 (1.6%), 19 (2.2%), and 8 (1.7%) neoplasms in the placebo, olodaterol 5 mcg, olodaterol 10 mcg, and formoterol groups, respectively. The rate per 100 patient years is 1.94, 2.89, 4.24, and 2.84 in the placebo, olodaterol 5 mcg, olodaterol 10 mcg, and formoterol groups, respectively. There were 2, 3, 6, and 4 malignant lung neoplasms in placebo, olodaterol 5 mcg, olodaterol 10 mcg, and formoterol groups, respectively. There were 4 cases of small cell lung carcinoma, all in the olodaterol 10 mcg group. Approximately half of the total malignant lung neoplasms, including 2 of the small cell lung carcinomas, were diagnosed within 5 months of beginning of randomized treatment. Given the small number of neoplasms, short lead-time to the diagnosis of neoplasms, and lack of similar findings in animal carcinogenicity studies, it is not likely that this is a safety signal.</p><p>Cardiovascular adverse events are a specific safety event of interest for beta-adrenergic agonist drugs because of their known pharmacologic effects. An adjudicated analysis of MACE did not reveal any concerns. Fatal MACE events occurred in 8 (0.9%), 3 (0.3%), 3 (0.3%), and 6 (1.3%) of patients in the placebo, olodaterol 5 mcg, olodaterol 10 mcg, <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Serious Adverse Drug Experience is defined in 21 CFR 312.32 as any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience (defined in the same regulation as any adverse drug experience that places the patient or subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred), inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Advisory Committee Meeting</head><p>A meeting of the Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee (PADAC) was held on January 29, 2013, to discuss this application. The major issues for discussion were the adequacy of the efficacy data to support the proposed indication, the adequacy of the safety database for making an informed benefit-risk assessment, and the benefit-risk assessment for olodaterol 5 mcg once daily for its proposed indication. In general, the panel members concluded that there were sufficient data to support the efficacy of olodaterol for the proposed indication. On voting questions, the Committee voted favorably regarding whether there was substantial evidence of efficacy (15 yes, 1 no, and 1 abstain), and also voted favorably on the safety of olodaterol (15 yes, 1 no, and 1 abstain). Regarding the approvability question, which is essentially the sum of the demonstration of efficacy and safety, the results were in favor of approval (15 yes, 1 no, and 1 abstain). Overall, members felt that BI had conducted a rigorous, well-designed program that was strengthened by the inclusion of usual care background therapy. The only safety issue of concern was the occurrence of 4 cases of small cell lung carcinoma, all in the olodaterol 10 mcg group. Members noted that while this may have been a random occurrence, appropriate post-marketing surveillance is warranted.</p><p>The committee was asked to discuss the finding of the exercise endurance studies. There was no voting question on exercise endurance because this was not an indication that BI was seeking and for complexity of the data discussed in section 7 above. The committee b. Physician Labeling BI submitted a label in the Physician Labeling Rule format. The label was reviewed by various disciplines of this Division, the Office of Medical Policy Programs (OMPP), DRISK, DMEPA, and by OPDP. Various changes to different sections of the label were done to reflect the data accurately and better communicate the findings to healthcare providers. The labeling language in the Clinical Trials section related to exercise endurance was not allowed due to reasons discussed in section 7 above. Asthma-related safety warnings are described in the label, including in a Boxed Warning, which are present in all LABAs. The Division and BI have agreed on the final label language.</p><p>c. Carton and Immediate Container Labels These were reviewed by various disciplines of this Division and DMEPA, and found to be acceptable.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>b. Risk-Benefit Assessment</head><p>The overall risk-benefit assessment supports approval of olodaterol inhalation spray at a dose of 5 mcg once daily for long-term once daily maintenance bronchodilator treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD, including bronchitis and emphysema.</p><p>A major safety concern with olodaterol is linked to selection of appropriate dose, because beta-2 adrenergic bronchodilators, particularly at high doses, have the safety concerns of severe asthma exacerbations and asthma-related deaths in patients who use these drugs to treat the symptoms of asthma. Although such a risk of worsening disease has not been shown in COPD, it is nevertheless important to select an appropriate and safe dose for all bronchodilators. BI conducted a comprehensive program, including dose ranging through pivotal confirmatory studies, to select the 5 mcg once daily dose. The submitted safety data do not show safety findings of unique concerns with olodaterol. From an efficacy standpoint, the clinical program showed that olodaterol at 5 mcg once-daily dose provided statistically significant replicate bronchodilator effect with effect. Although the observed effect size for olodaterol across studies appeared to be somewhat lower than that observed in previous registration trials for other LABAs for COPD, the effect sizes were comparable to other marketed bronchodilators when they were compared in the olodaterol program where the background therapy across treatment groups were similar. c.

Note that an Pulmonary Allergy Drug Advisory Committee (PADAC) is scheduled for 1/29/13 to discuss the safety and efficacy of this product. Based on the discussion, the recommended regulatory action may be subject to change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Risk Benefit Assessment</head><p>The core development program to support olodaterol 5mcg qD consisted of 3 doseranging trials in COPD patients <ref type="figure">(</ref> Support for efficacy is derived primarily from the four parallel group 48-week COPD trials, two of which were conducted primarily in the United States (US) and two of which were conducted primarily in Europe (EU). These trials shared the same spirometric coprimary endpoints of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) AUC (0-3 hours) response and trough FEV1. The two US trials (1222.11 and 1222.12) were 3-arm trials which assessed the co-primary endpoints after 12 weeks of treatment. The two EU trials (1222.13 and 1222.14) were 4-arm trials including the active comparator formoterol and assessed the co-primary endpoints after 24 weeks. Trials 1222.13 and 1222.14 also included a third non-spirometric co-primary endpoint of Mahler Transitional Dyspnea Index (TDI) score assessed at 24 weeks and the key secondary endpoint of the Saint George's Respiratory Questionanaire (SGRQ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bronchodilator effects</head><p>In three (1222.11, 1222.13, and 1222.14) of the four 48 week COPD trials, olodaterol 5mcg demonstrated significant improvements in both spirometric co-primary endpoints. For trial 1222.12, results were only statistically significant for FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) response, but not trough FEV1 response when using the protocol-specified analysis. The difference from placebo for FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) response in trials 1222.11, 1222.12, 1222.13, and 1222.14 were 0.164, 0.134, 0.151, and 0.129L (all p-values Clinical Review Robert H. Lim, MD NDA 203,108 Olodaterol inhalation solution 13 &lt;0.0001), respectively. For trough FEV1 response, the differences from placebo were 0.084 (p=0.0002), 0.033 (p&gt;0.05), 0.078 (p=0.0002), and 0.053L (p=0.006), respectively. Based on these results, the effect size was relatively modest with respect to trough FEV1. However, this may have been in part related to concomitant medications, as patients were allowed to continue on all maintenance COPD medications, except for LABAs. In these trials approximately 20-25% of patients were on tiotropium as background therapy. When the sponsor performed a stratified analysis based on baseline tiotropium usage, the difference between strata was not statistically significant. In the 6-week trials 1222.39 and 1222.40 in which LAMAs were prohibited as background therapy, the treatment effect of olodaterol 5mcg on trough FEV1 after 6 weeks of treatment was higher at 0.133 and 0.134L, respectively (p&lt;0.0001). It should also be noted that in trials 1222.13 and 1222.14 the treatment effect of olodaterol 5mcg was similar to the active comparator fomoterol.</p><p>Efficacy was further supported by the spirometric secondary endpoints in these trials. These secondary endpoints included FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) response at days 1, 43, 85, 169, and 337; and trough FEV1 response at days 15, 43, 85, 169, and 337. At all time points and across all the 48 week trials, olodaterol 5mcg demonstrated a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo. The magnitude of the treatment effect at these time points was similar to that of the co-primary endpoints. It is of note that secondary endpoint analyses were not corrected for multiple comparisons. In distinction to the spirometric endpoints, olodaterol 5mcg had no statistically significant effect on Mahler TDI scores. With regard to SGRQ, while there were statistically significant differences between olodaterol 5mcg and placebo, the differences were consistently less than the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 4.</p><p>The 4 six week crossover trials (1222.24, 1222.25, 1222.39 and 1222.40) were also supportive of a bronchodilatory effect. These trials were meant to characterize the 24hour FEV1 time profile of olodaterol. In all trials, statistically significant improvements were demonstrated for both co-primary endpoints [FEV1 AUC(0-12 hours) and FEV1 AUC(12-24hours)] for the olodaterol 5mcg dose compared to placbeo. The difference from placebo for FEV1 AUC (0-12 hours) response in trials 1222.24, 1222.25, 1222.39, and 1222.40 were 0.148, 0.172, 0.185, 0.197L (all p-values &lt;0.0001), respectively. For FEV AUC(12-24 hours) response, the differences from placebo were 0.109, 0.118, 0.131, 0.153L (p&lt;0.0001), respectively. However, whether or not this data is applicable to later time points (i.e. 12 and 24 weeks) and appropriate for inclusion in the label is questionable. In the 48-week COPD trials, in the majority of trials, the treatment effect was numerically greater at 6 weeks versus 12 or 24 weeks. As such, the results from these 6 week treatment period cross-over trials may not accurately reflect the 24-hour spirometry at later time points.</p><p>Overall, based on the totality of the data, olodaterol 5mcg appears to have a clinically significant effect on bronchodilation. Although the magnitude of the treatment effect is somewhat modest in the 48-week trials, this may be related to the baseline COPD Clinical Review Robert H. Lim, MD NDA 203,108 Olodaterol inhalation solution 14 medications allowed in those trials. Whether or not the treatment effect in the setting of other baseline medications is sufficient to warrant a bronchodilator claim for olodaterol will be a topic of discussion at the January 29, 2013 PADAC meeting. The outcome of the discussion may affect the clinical recommendation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects on exercise tolerance</head><p>To support their labeling claims for increased exercise tolerance, increased inspiratory capacity (IC) at rest and at end exercise, and reduced lung hyperinflation based on decreased functional residual capacity (FRC), the sponsor submitted the results from trials 1222.37 and 1222.38. These were 6-week treatment period cross-over trials with a primary endpoint of exercise endurance time (ET) during constant workrate cycle ergometry (CWRCE) at 75% maximal workload after 6 weeks of treatment. Maximal workload was determined using incremental cycle ergometry performed prior to receiving any trial medication. Key secondary endpoints included IC and intensity of breathing discomfort at isotime. Isotime was defined as ET during of the shortest during. CWRCE was performed 2 hours after trial medication was administered.</p><p>ET after 6 weeks of olodaterol 5mcg was statistically significantly greater than after 6 weeks of placebo. The treatment difference was 12-14% or 40-50 seconds across the two trials [baseline 374-414 seconds (geometric mean)]. ICs were also increased at isotime and at rest (trough and 1 hour post-dose) after receiving olodaterol 5mcg compared to placebo. Statistically significant differences for breathing discomfort as measured by the Borg Category Ratio Scale (BCRS) were only reported in trial 1222.37 and not 1222.38. This lack of replication implies that olodaterol does not improve breathing discomfort. For FRC, while it was statistically significantly decreased 1 hour post dose when comparing olodaterol 5mcg to placebo, this was not the case for the trough value. These data imply that the olodaterol 5mcg effect on FRC was not durable over the dosing interval. The clinical significance of the effect of olodaterol 5mcg on exercise tolerance and lung hyperinflation will be a topic for discussion at the PADAC meeting. The outcome of this discussion may affect how this product is ultimately labeled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety</head><p>The safety information for olodaterol 5mcg comes primarily from the 48-week COPD trials. In the 48-week trials, 876 patients were exposed to olodaterol 5mcg and 883 to olodaterol 10mcg for a total of 1,759 exposed patients. An additional 1594 COPD patients were exposed to olodaterol in shorter-term trials, for a total of 3353 COPD patients exposed for any duration during the olodaterol program. Of these patients, 1014 patients were exposed to olodaterol for ≥48 weeks (≥337 days). Five-hundredtwelve (512) asthmatic patients were also exposed to oldodaterol during the development program.</p><p>There were a total of 53 on-treatment deaths in the 48-week trials. These were relatively evenly split between treatment groups (placebo=1.5%, Olo 5mcg=1.5%, Olo Clinical Review Robert H. Lim, MD NDA 203,108 Olodaterol inhalation solution 10mcg=1.9%, and formoterol=2.2%). Based on adjudicated data, the most frequent cause of death was COPD exacerbation as expected in this patient population.</p><p>Serious adverse events (SAEs) were also evenly balanced among treatment groups, with 16.4% of placebo patients, 15.8% of olodaterol 5mcg patients, 16.6% of olodaterol 10mcg patients, and 15.0% of formoterol patients experiencing an SAE in the 48 week trials. As expected in this patient population, the most common serious adverse events (SAE) were COPD exacerbation (5.8%), pneumonia (1.8%), all fractures (0.5%), and atrial fibrillation (0.5%). COPD exacerbations were evenly distributed across treatment groups. However, pneumonias were more common in the high-dose olodaterol (Olo) groups (Olo 5mcg=1.6%, Olo 10mcg=2.5%) compared to placebo (1.5%). The same was true of atrial fibrillation (placebo=0.3%, Olo 5mcg=0.6%, Olo 10mcg=0.6%).</p><p>The most common adverse [by preferred terms (PT)] leading to discontinuation were COPD exacerbation (2.2%), dyspnea (0.4%), pneumonia (0.3%), and atrial fibrillation (0.3%). There were not significant imbalances between groups. The most commonly reported treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were COPD exacerbation (28.3%), nasopharyngitis (9.8%), upper respiratory infection (7.5%), dyspnea (3.9%), and bronchitis (3.8%). Of these, only nasopharyngitis was more commonly reported in both olodaterol groups compared to placebo. It should also be noted that there was a marked differential discontinuation in the placebo groups compared to olodaterol groups. Approximately 23% of placebo patients discontinued the 48-week trials early compared to 15-16% in the olodaterol groups. The most common reasons for discontinuation were adverse events (AEs) and lack of efficacy. An analysis of major cardiac events (MACE) was also conducted. This analysis demonstrated no imbalances. The sponsor's MACE analysis was also complemented by a cardiovascular assessment based on Standard MedDRA Queries (SMQs). Only in 2 SMQs were imbalances noted when comparing both olodaterol groups to placebo. Adverse events in the SMQ Cardiac arrhythmias sub− SMQ ventricular tachyarrhythmias occurred in 9 (1%), 17 (1.9%), and 12 (1.4%) in placebo, olodaterol 5mcg and olodaterol 10mcg, respectively. It should be noted that AEs in this SMQ occurred most frequently in the formoterol group [9 (2%)]. AEs in the SMQ Cardiac failure (narrow) occurred in 5 (0.6%), 11 (1.3%), and 7 (0.8%) in placebo, olodaterol 5mcg and olodaterol 10mcg, respectively. The noted imbalances were low in frequency, but consistent with the known potential cardiac effects of LABAs.</p><p>An adjudicated analysis of events leading to death, hospitalization, and intubation was also performed in the all COPD patients from the phase 2/3 trials, as well as all the asthma patients from the asthma dose-ranging trials. In the asthma population, there were no asthma-related deaths, hospitalizations, or intubations. There was single respiratory related event (pneumonia), which occurred in a patient who had received olodaterol 10mcg. The analysis of the COPD dataset did not reveal any significant imbalances nor any new safety signals. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Important Safety Issues With Consideration to Related Drugs</head><p>Inhaled beta-2 adrenergic agonists have been associated with an increased risk of severe exacerbations and asthma-related deaths in patients with asthma. Given the longer duration of action, this is of particular concern with LABAs. This risk was first highlighted by the 1996 Salmeterol Multicenter Asthma Research Trial (SMART). SMART was a randomized, double-blind trial that enrolled patients with asthma not currently using LABAs to assess the safety of salmeterol (42 mcg twice daily for 28 weeks) compared to placebo when added to usual asthma therapy. The primary endpoint was the combined number of respiratory-related deaths or respiratory-related life-threatening experiences (intubation and mechanical ventilation). In January 2003, after a total of approximately 30,000 patients had been enrolled, this trial was prematurely terminated due to a planned interim analysis suggesting that salmeterol may be associated with an increased risk of severe asthma exacerbations including death.</p><p>Due to findings of SMART, as well as findings in smaller safety studies conducted with another LABA, formoterol, the safety of LABAs was the topic of discussion at a July 13, 2005, Pulmonary Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee Meeting (PADAC). Based on this meeting and a follow up PADAC meeting on December 10, 2008, the existing product labels have been revised and now include a Boxed Warning and a Medication Guide for all marketed LABA products. In addition, the paradigm for asthma treatment with LABAs has now changed, contraindicating the use of a LABA without a concomitant asthma controller medication, such as an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS).</p><p>Because it is unclear if addition of an inhaled corticosteroid mitigates the risk of LABAs in asthma, sponsors of LABA products indicated for asthma are being required to perform large safety trials to evaluate serious asthma outcomes in patients receiving concomitant ICS and LABA. The design of these trials was discussed at a PADAC meeting held March 10-11, 2010.</p><p>While no such safety signal has been observed in COPD patients, dose-related class effects of beta-agonists, especially those affecting the cardiac and central nervous systems, can be deleterious to older patients with COPD, many of whom have increased cerebral and cardiovascular risk factors. As such, FDA recommends that all sponsors of LABA products explore dose ranging as thoroughly as possible, taking into account both safety and efficacy issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Summary of Presubmission Regulatory Activity Related to Submission</head><p>Prior to submission of this NDA, this product was developed under IND 76,362. Major regulatory milestones are summarized below:</p><p>1/26/07: IND submission 7/17/08: End-of-phase 2 (EOP2) meeting. The major clinical points of discussion were as follows:</p><p>• Agreement that the 5mcg and 10mcg doses were reasonable to carry forward, with the caveat that the optimum dosing interval had not been established. • Agreement that the co-primary endpoints of FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) and trough FEV1 at 12 weeks were reasonable to assess bronchodilator efficacy in phase 3. The sponsor included additional timepoints for post-dose serial spirometry for a subset of 240 patients in trials 1222.11 and 1222.12 (out to 12 hours post-dose). The Agency agreed that this would allow for adequate description of FEV1 time profile. • Statement that 24-hour serial spirometry data from 6-week trials would only be supportive if the treatment effect was similar at 6-weeks compared to 12-weeks [FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) and trough FEV1]. • Recommendation that the sponsor add COPD exacerbations as an additional secondary endpoint to phase 3 trials.</p><p>12/22/09: Advice request. Sponsor submitted data to support once-daily dosing. The major points of discussion were as follows:</p><p>• Data in addition to the COPD dose posology trial were required to support a once-daily dosing regimen. • Recommendation that the sponsor determine optimum dose and dose regimen in asthmatics prior to proceeding to with COPD development program. 7/19/11: Pre-NDA meeting request (meeting canceled). The agency's major points of were as follows:</p><p>• Agreement with the format of summary of clinical efficacy and summary of clinical safety. • The sponsor should perform sub-group analysis based on reversibility, treatment by sub-group interaction analysis, and major adverse cardiac event (MACE) analysis. • Submit all narratives for SAEs for phase 3 trials.</p><p>• Include safety analyses for those patients with a cardiac history.</p></div>

This cartridge is packaged with the Respimat device, which delivers 60 actuations (2.5mcg of olodaterol/actuation) after priming. The proposed dosing for treatment of COPD is 5mcg (2 actuations) once daily.</p><p>The first time a patient uses the drug product, he removes the transparent base on the Respimat device and inserts the cartridge containing the formulation. Once inserted the cartridge cannot be removed. The clear base is replaced and the patient turns the base until a 'click' is heard, then primes the device by spraying until a mist is observed and then another 3 times into the air. To administer a dose, the yellow cap is then opened and the patient seals his lips around the mouthpiece. During inhalation, the patient presses the trigger button while continuing to inhale.</p><p>The device also has an integrated dose-counter. After delivering 60 actuations, the device locks to prevent further dosing. The to-be-marketed device was used in all the phase 2 and 3 trials.

In rodents, the female reproductive tract (rat and mouse uterine leiomyomas) and skeletal muscle (rat) were identified. In dogs, the kidney was identified. In addition, in the respiratory tract; the nasal cavity, the larynx, and the trachea were affected by olodaterol. All these are common target organs of toxicity of βadrenergic agonists. There are no apparent differences between the effects observed with olodaterol compared to other approved LABAs. A NOAEL for systemic toxicities was identified in the rat and the dog and provide adequate exposure margins compared to the exposure at the proposed clinical dose Based on the sponsor's analysis of the genotoxicity studies, olodaterol is not genotoxic. Carcinogenicity studies did not demonstrate carcinogenic potential for olodaterol at relevant doses. However, as with other beta-2 AR agonists, exposure to olodaterol was related to rodent uterine leiomyomas. These findings were noted at &gt;20x the human exposure.

Details of the CP review can be found in Dr. Ping Ji's review. Olodaterol promotes bronchodilation by binding to beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the lungs, predominantly in smooth muscle. Although it can bind at beta-1 and beta-3 adrenergic receptors, it does so at much lower affinity, theoretically decreasing off-target effects.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design and Conduct</head><p>Overview This was a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled, 5-way cross-over trial with an open label extension in 36 patients with COPD. Following screening at visit 1, patients began a 1-2 week run-in period. After the run-in period, eligible patients were randomized to receive placebo and 4 doses of olodaterol (2, 5, 10, and 20mcg) in a random sequence. After each dose, PFTs were conducted over a 24 hour time period (-10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 22, 23, and 24 hours). PK measurements were also performed. Between doses, there was a 14 day washout period. Olodaterol was administered on visit 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Patients participating in the open label extension received an additional single dose of 40mcg followed by PFTs and PK measurements. The assessment schedule is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>.  The timing of safety, PK, and PFT monitoring at visits 2-6 are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 4</ref>. 8.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer comment:</head><p>The primary endpoint and secondary endpoints were appropriate and typical for COPD dose ranging trials. Positive findings for these endpoints in this single dose trial would be supportive of performing further multiple dose ranging trials. The safety monitoring parameters were also appropriate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Plan Sample Size</head><p>The proposed sample size of 30 patients per dose provides a 90% power to detect a difference of 100mL with a standard deviation of 150mL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis populations</head><p>The sponsor pre-specified four analysis populations. The full analysis set (FAS) consisted of all patients with baseline data and any post-dosing efficacy data. The perprotocol (PP) population consisted of the patients who did not have significant protocol violations (i.e. violations that could affect efficacy results). The safety population was made up of all treated patients. The PK set consisted of all data obtained from the subset of patients who participated in the PK sub-study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Analysis</head><p>Reference ID: 3246646 The primary variable to be analyzed was FEV1 24 hours after dosing in the FAS population. The variable was analyzed using ANCOVA. To account for type 1 error analysis was performed in an ordered fashion starting with a comparison of Olo 20mcg to placebo. If Olo 20mcg demonstrated a statistically significantly greater FEV1 then placebo (one-tailed p-value 0.025), then the next lower dose was compared to placebo.</p><p>The secondary efficacy variables were analyzed using ANCOVA in a manner similar to the primary efficacy variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>Protocol Changes: Following completion of the 5-way cross over portion of this trial, preliminary analysis of the PK data revealed that single doses of up to 20mcg of olodaterol resulted in only very low serum concentrations. Therefore, the extension portion of the trial was added, during which the 18 patients who participated in the PK substudy received a single dose of 40mcg open-label olodaterol followed by measurement of PK parameters.</p><p>There were also changes to the planned statistical analysis. The PP population was amended to state that a relevant protocol deviation would only exclude patient data for the relevant treatment period(s). Additionally, the PP population would only be defined if there were a greater than 10% difference compared to the FAS. Also, if the bronchodilator response, defined as an increase in FEV1 of 12%, did not occur within 3 hours of dosing, then the time to onset would be defined at 3 hours 1 minute.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol Violations</head><p>There were no protocol violations in the 40mcg extension portion of this trial. In the main portion of this trial, there were a total of 12 patients with important protocol deviations (IPV). These occurred more frequently during the placebo and Olo 2mcg treatment periods [7 (19.4%) and 5 (13.9%), respectively] compared to the 5, 10, and 20mcg treatment periods [3 (8.3%), 3 (8.3%), and 2 (5.6%), respectively]. The most common violations were missing primary endpoint data and baseline variability of the FEV1. These results are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_22">Table 5</ref>.  Reviewer comment: It is unlikely that the protocol changes would have significantly affected data interpretation. With regard to the protocol violations, they were more frequent during the placebo and Olo 2mcg treatment periods. While this could potentially affect data interpretation, as there were multiple further dose ranging trials, these violations are unlikely to have significantly affected the overall dose ranging program and dose conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient Disposition</head><p>A total of 37 patients enrolled in the main portion of trial. Of these 36 were randomized, all were treated. Two patients did not complete all treatment periods due to adverse events. For the 40mcg single dose extension, 15 patients were enrolled and 14 patients were treated. Patient disposition is summarized in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>. During all olodaterol treatment periods, peak FEV1 within the 1 st 3 hours post-dose was statistically significantly greater compared to placebo. The same was also true for peak FVC within 3 hours post-dosing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment:</head><p>Based on the primary endpoint, all doses of olodaterol have significant bronchodilatory action compared to placebo. There is also a clear dose response. The secondary endpoints are consistent with this conclusion. It should also be noted that as olodaterol doses were increased, the incremental benefits decreased. In general, it appears that the greatest incremental benefit occurred between the 2mcg and 5mcg doses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Endpoints:</head><p>In addition to efficacy endpoints, this trial also assessed the PK characteristics of a single dose of olodaterol. Initially PK data was only collected for the 2, 5, 10, and 20 mcg doses; however, due to low serum concentrations following dosing an additional 40 mcg dosing period was added. Following a single dose of Olo 2mcg, serum olodaterol could only be detected in 5 of the 18 participants. The levels detected were marginally greater than the lower limit of detection. For the 5mcg group, 9 of 18 patients had detectable levels of olodaterol for 20 minutes following dosing. In the 20 and 40mcg  Reviewer Comment: Serum levels appear to be dose proportional, and at the 5mcg qD dose proposed by the sponsor, serum levels are likely to be undetectable by 1 hour post-dose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Exposure</head><p>Safety analysis was performed on all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication. A total of 36 patients were included in the safety data set. All but 2 patients received all olodaterol doses in the main portion of the trial. These patients were withdrawn from the trial due to COPD exacerbations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deaths/SAEs</head><p>There were no deaths. Four patients reported SAEs, which were recorded as hemoptysis, perineal abscess, and COPD x2. The episode of hemoptysis occurred 6 days after the patient receive the last dose in his treatment sequence (placebo).</p></div>

Lim, MD NDA 203,108 Olodaterol inhalation solution</head><p>Adverse Events (AE) Adverse events that occurred during a treatment period or within 14 days after the treatment period were assigned to that treatment period.

Following an initial screening period, patients entered a 2 week baseline period. Following the baseline period, eligible patients were randomized to receive one of four doses of olodaterol (2, 5, 10, or 20mcg) once daily for 4 weeks. Following completion of 4 weeks of therapy, patients were followed for an additional 30 days.</p><p>Patients were seen in clinic at -2 to -4 weeks (visit 1), week 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 (visits 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively). Prior to visit 1, informed consent was obtained and patients' washout of restricted medications began. After medication washout, at visit 1, eligible patients began the 2 week baseline period. During this period baseline PEFR and rescue medication use was recorded. Patients were who not sufficiently compliant or had unstable disease during the baseline period were not randomized to treatment with olodaterol at visit 2 (week 0). During the treatment phase (visits 2-5), patients continued to measure daily PEFR and rescue medication use. During visits 2-4, serial spirometry was performed prior to dosing and up to 3 hours after dosing. At visit 5, serial spirometry was performed up to 6 hours after dosing.

Positive results for the primary endpoint would be supportive of a bronchodilator effect. With regard to the secondary endpoints, the Physician Global Assessment and COPD symptoms score may be of limited value given its subjective nature. Additionally, the use of nonsupervised at home PFTs is of questionable value, as it is unclear how reliable those results would be. Other secondary endpoints would generally be supportive of a bronchodilatory effect for olodaterol. The safety, PK, and compliance assessments are also reasonable. However, ideally the sponsor would have used additional measures of compliance such as medication weight/returned medication.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis populations</head><p>The sponsor pre-specified 3 analysis populations. The full analysis set (FAS) consisted of all patients with baseline data and at least one adequate measurement following at least 5 days of randomized treatment for at least one endpoint.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Missing Data</head><p>For missing spirometry data, values were estimated using other recorded values for that day. If the value was missing due to rescue medication use, then the least favorable value from that day was used. Estimations were made by linear interpolation of the adjacent data, or by last observed carried forward if no subsequent data were available. However if a single pre-dose measurement was missing, the other pre-dose measurement was used. If both were missing, pre-dose data from the prior visit was used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Analysis</head><p>The primary variable was FEV1 response after 4 weeks of treatment. The variable was analyzed using ANCOVA. To account for type 1 error analysis was performed in an ordered fashion starting with a comparison of Olo 20mcg to placebo. If the Olo 20mcg dose demonstrated a significantly greater trough FEV1 response than placebo (onetailed p-value 0.025), then the next lower dose was compared to placebo.</p><p>The secondary efficacy variables will be analyzed using ANCOVA in a manner similar to the primary efficacy variable.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Analysis</head><p>The safety analysis was descriptive. All events were coded with the MedDRA 9.1 dictionary. All events with an onset after the first dose of study medication up to 12 days after the last dose were assigned to the treatment period.

In the first, submitted on 12/15/2006, BI adding wording stating that genetic investigations would be limited to the effect of genetic variations on respiratory diseases. The 2 nd amendment was submitted 5/7/2007. This amendment added an additional lab draw for potassium Clinical Review Robert H. Lim, MD NDA 203,108 Olodaterol inhalation solution</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>50</head><p>(1 hour post dose). This amendment also added serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) to the standard lab draw, clarified data to be included in the eDiary, and prohibited use of antihistamines and antileukotrienes unless prescribed for a condition other than asthma. The 3 rd amendment was submitted on 8/17/2007. This amendment modified the normal limits of bilirubin and creatinine to be in line with the central lab.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol Violations</head><p>The majority of protocol violations were related to compliance data (missing compliance data or compliance outside range). Compliance issues were the most common cause of protocol violations. They occurred in the placebo, Olo 2mcg, Olo 5mcg, Olo 10mcg, and Olo 20mcg with incidences of 16.9%, 12.4%, 21.3%, 11.6%, and 24.1%, respectively. Otherwise, the numbers were similar generally similar across groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment:</head><p>It is unlikely that the protocol amendments would have impacted trial results or their interpretation. It is possible that the increased number of protocol violations due to compliance issues in the Olo 5mcg and Olo 10mcg group compared to placebo could affect trial results. As this would potentially understate a treatment effect for the 5 and 10mcg groups, it is not a large concern.</p><p>Patient Disposition A total of 621 patients were enrolled in this trial. Of these, 405 patients were randomized of whom 96% completed this trial. Premature discontinuation was most common in the Olo 5mcg and placebo group. The most common reason for discontinuation was an adverse event. AEs as a reason for discontinuation was most common in the Olo 5mcg group. In the placebo, Olo 2, 5, 10, 20 mcg groups, 1 (1.3%), 1 (1.2%), 5 (6.3%), 0, and 2 (2.5%) patients withdrew due to AEs, respectively. However, AEs related to study disease worsening leading to discontinuation were low and similar between groups. Lack of efficacy as a reason for discontinuation was most common in the placebo group. Patient disposition data are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 13</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Review Robert H. Lim, MD NDA 203,108 Olodaterol inhalation solution</head><p>Reviewer Comment: Based on the primary endpoint, all doses of olodaterol demonstrated a statistically significant bronchodilator effect compared to placebo. This effect demonstrated a clear dose response. As with trial 1222.3, the incremental benefit of increasing doses appeared less pronounced the higher the dose. Based on the primary endpoint, the 20mcg dose has only a minimal incremental benefit compared to the 10mcg dose. For the secondary endpoints of trough FEV1 response at week 1 and 2, the results were similar; however, the dose response was not as evident. This was especially true at week one. With regard to rescue medication use, while there was some numerical improvement, it was not statistically significant. The results for the symptom score and Physician Global Assessment score are of questionable value because the scores are highly subjective in nature, and have not been validated as an efficacy endpoints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacokinetics</head><p>Following inhalation, serum levels of olodaterol could only be detected in 7 of 81 patients given Olo 2mcg. In patients receiving 5mcg, levels were quantifiable up to 20 minutes post-dose on day 1 and up to 40 minutes on day 29 in approximately 1/3 of patients. For the Olo 10 and 20mcg groups, 1/3 of patients had detectable serum levels 3 hours post-dose on day 1 and up to 6 hours on day 29. For the 5, 10, and 20mcg groups, the maximum plasma concentration was observed around 10 minutes postdose (single and repeated doses). The decline after peak was rapid. Serum concentration data is summarized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>. Reviewer Comment: These PK results are consistent with trial 1222.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety:</head><p>Exposure: A total of 326 patients were exposed to olodaterol and 79 to placebo. The mean exposure time was 29 days and was similar across groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deaths and SAEs</head><p>There were no deaths in this trial. There were 8 SAEs reported in the Olodaterol dose groups (2 per dose), and none in the placebo group. In the 2 mcg group, one SAE was due to lung cancer and one due to a COPD exacerbation and pleural effusion (s/p motorcycle accident). In the 5 mcg group, there was one SAE of diverticulitis and one of hip fracture s/p fall. In the 10 mcg group, there was one report of COPD exacerbation and one of humerus fracture s/p fall. In the 20 mcg group, there was one report of COPD exacerbation and one upper GI bleed Treatment Emergent AEs All AEs occurring after the first dose of trial medication until 12 days after the last dose were considered treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) in the review of this trial. Overall, the total on treatment AEs were similar across treatment groups ranging between 30-40%. Total overall AEs were highest in the Olo 5 mcg group [33 (41.3%)] and lowest in the Olo 10 mcg group [26 (30.2)]. For the placebo group, AEs were reported in 29 patients (37%). The most frequent common AEs (&gt;3% in any group) were in the RTM SOC. By preferred term, the most common AE was cough. Aside from headache and dyspnea, all other common AEs demonstrated an imbalance when comparing placebo to at least one olodaterol dose group. These results are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 17</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vitals signs</head><p>The number of patients with changes from baseline in blood pressure was comparable between olodaterol groups and placebo treatment periods. There was also no significant differences in pulse rates based on mean values. However, for all olodaterol dose groups except 2mcg more patients with normal baseline pulse were noted to have elevated pulse rates at any point during the trial compared to placebo. However, there was not a dose response. New or worsening of ECG changes were not noted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer comment:</head><p>Overall, olodaterol did not appear to have a significant effect on lab values in most patients. Although the highest dose of olodaterol appeared to decreased serum potassium levels after the 1 st dose and at day 8, this effect did not persist at the end of treatment; nor was this effect seen in any other dose groups. This is reassuring as the proposed dose is 5mcg once daily. The potassium results are not surprising given that olodaterol is a beta-agonist, and decreased potassium is a known pharmacodynamic effect.</p><p>Overall Reviewer Comment: Based on the primary and secondary endpoints, olodaterol at doses from 2mcg to 20mcg once daily have a significant bronchodilatory effect compared to placebo. Further, there is dose response, although the incremental benefit for increasing doses decreases at doses greater than 5mcg. There is little additional benefit from the 20mcg dose. These efficacy results are consistent with trial 1222.3. With regard to safety, olodaterol was fairly well tolerated and no adverse events demonstrated a dose response. However, the statistically significant decreases in potassium and increases in CPK at the 20mcg dose, suggest that this dose is unnecessarily high. The efficacy and safety data suggest that a dose &lt;20mcg is optimal.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design and Conduct Overview</head><p>This was double-blind, randomized, 4-way crossover, dose interval trial in patients with moderate to severe stable COPD. The objective of this trial was to determine optimum dosing interval (qD versus BID). Each treatment period lasted 3 weeks with no washout period between. The doses of olodaterol used were 2 mcg BID, 5 mcg BID, 5 mcg qD, and 10 mcg qD. PFTs were performed at baseline (prior to any test article) and at the end of each 3 week treatment period. There was no placebo group as patients were compared to their own baseline.</p><p>Patients were seen in clinic at -8 days (visit 1), day 0 (visit 2), and weeks 3, 6, 9, 12 and 14 (visits 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, respectively). Prior to visit 1, informed consent was obtained and washout of restricted medications began (visit 0). After washout of medications, at visit 1, eligible patients began the one week baseline period. At visit 2, eligible patients were randomized to treatment sequences. 24-hour baseline spirometry was also performed at visit 2. At visits 3-6, treatment for the following treatment periods were dispensed. 24 hour spirometry was also performed at these visits. Patients were seen for an end of trial visit 14 days after the last treatment period. Trial assessment schedule is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 18</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concomitant Medications/Prohibited Medications:</head><p>All medications taken by patients were recorded in the CRF. During the treatment period, patients were allowed to be on salbutamol (albuterol) PRN. If short acting bronchodilator medication was needed during 24 hour serial spirometry, the PFTs were discontinued. Long acting beta-agonists (LABA) were not to be taken 12 hours prior to PFTs. Short acting bronchodilators (beta-adrenergic and anticholinergic) were not be taken 8 hours prior to PFTs. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) were not allowed 1 hour prior to PFTs. The morning dose of study medication was not to be taken prior to pre-dose PFTs. Long acting anticholinergics were only allowed during the follow-up period, but were prohibited during the baseline and treatment periods.</p><p>Patients on ICS/LABA combination therapies were switched to ICS alone 48 hours prior to visit 1. Patients on fixed dose anticholinergic/short acting beta-agonist (SABA) were switched to Atrovent prior to baseline period and allowed to use salbutamol PRN. Patients on Anti-leukotrienes were only allowed if they were prescribed for conditions other than asthma.</p><p>Medications for COPD exacerbations were allowed as necessary. However, patients were discontinued for COPD exacerbations. The prohibited and allowed medications are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 12</ref> in section 5.3.2 (Trial 1222.5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer comment:</head><p>Given the objective, the trial design is reasonable. Based on the previous COPD dose ranging trials, it is reasonable to explore total daily doses (TDD) of 5 and 10mcg. The inclusion/exclusion criteria are also reasonable. At the time this study was conducted, a 2.5 mcg dose was not available; although the 2 mcg BID dose offers a reasonable (if slightly lower) approximation. Note that the 2.5 mcg BID regimen is tested in the asthma dose interval trial (Trial 1222.29).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis Sample Size</head><p>Based on previous trials, BI assumed a standard deviation in FEV1 AUC (0-12 hours) of 0.16 liters and for FEV1 AUC (12-24 hours) of 0.14 liters. Based on this BI estimated that randomization of 48 patients would yield 90% power to detect a 90mL difference in FEV AUC (0-12 hours) and a 80mL difference in FEV1 AUC (12-24 hours) (one sided alpha of 0.025).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient Disposition</head><p>A total of 56 patients enrolled in this trial, and 47 were randomized. All 47 received at least one dose of medication. Only one patient discontinued from this trial (AE, worsening of COPD). This occurred during the Olo 2mcg dosing period. This patient had only been exposed to Olo 5mcg otherwise. The FAS consistent of all 47 patients, and the PP population consisted of the 42 patients without important protocol deviations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographics/Baseline characteristics</head><p>The patients in this trial were predominantly Caucasian males, with an average age of 66 years with a 39 pack year history. The mean duration of COPD diagnosis was 12 years. Mean baseline FEV1 was 45% predicted with a 14.8% improvement following bronchodilator therapy. Means FEV1/FVC ratio was 44%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Compliance</head><p>Based on diary entries, compliance ranged from 99.9-100% for each treatment period. One hundred percent (100%) of patients took study medication &gt;80% of the time. The potential impact of the protocol amendments on interpretation will be discussed with biostatistics. As this is complete crossover design, it is also unlikely that the protocol violations will affect data interpretation. However, the sponsor also analyzed the co-primary endpoint in the PP population. The patient demographics and baseline spirometry was also typical of a COPD trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary Endpoint:</head><p>The co-primary endpoints were FEV AUC (0-12 hours) and FEV1 AUC (12-24 hours) response after 3 weeks of therapy. For all dose regimens, the FEV1 AUC (0-12 hours) and FEV1 AUC (12-24 hours) at 3 weeks demonstrated a statistically significant improvement from baseline values (p-values not corrected for multiple comparisons). These endpoints were compared between each of the treatment periods. For FEV1 AUC (0-12 hours), the 5mcg once daily has a greater treatment effect compared to 2mcg BID. For all other treatment period comparisons, there are no statistically significant differences. For FEV1 AUC (12-24 hours), the twice daily periods have a greater treatment effect when comparing 10mcg qD to 5mcg BID and 5mcg qD to 5mcg BID. Otherwise, there are no statistically significant differences. The results are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 19</ref>. The results for the secondary endpoint of individual FEV1 measurement at each time point over 24 hours after 3 weeks of treatment is summarized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>. The results for the FVC related endpoints were consistent with the analogous FEV1 related endpoints. These results are summarized visually in the individual FVC measurements at each time point over 24 hours after 3 weeks of treatment ( <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments:</head><p>In contrast to trial 1222.5 where there was a clear dose response for the primary endpoint, in this trial (1222.26), there is no such dose response. The 10mcg qD dose appears equivalent/slightly less effective compared to the 5 mcg qD. Additionally, the FEV1 AUC (0-12 hours) response is similar when comparing the 10mcg qD and 5mcg BID dose. Taken together, this implies that a single daily dose of 10 mcg and 5 mcg may be equivalent. This is not entirely inconsistent with previous COPD dose ranging trials as the incremental benefit of olodaterol waned at doses ≥5mcg. This is also consistent with the sponsor's phase 3 data. The trial results also imply that BID dosing may be more optimal than qD dosing based on the FEV1 AUC (12-24 hours) when comparing the 10mcg qD dose to 5mcg BID. However, when comparing the 2mcg BID to 5mcg qD dosing, on a whole, the once daily dosing appeared superior. Given these </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacokinetics:</head><p>Prior to olodaterol dosing (visit 2), 3 patients had detectable serum olodaterol levels. As these patients had no previous exposure to olodaterol, the sponsor assumed that this was due to contamination during sample handling. Pre-dose serum olodaterol concentrations (pg/mL) after 3 weeks of treatment were 2.92 and 2.97 for the 5mcg BID and 10mcg qD treatment periods, respectively. For the 2mcg BID and 5mcg qD periods, less than a 1/3 of patients had detectable levels. Serum olodaterol concentrations (pg/mL) at steady state were 3.52, 4.28, and 5.78 for the 5mcg qD, 5mcg BID, and 10mcg qD periods, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety:</head><p>Exposure: Forty-seven (47) patients received at least one dose of olodaterol. When broken down by treatment period, 47 patients received Olo 2mcg BID, 46 patients received Olo 5mcg BID, 47 patients received Olo 5mcg qD, and 46 patients received Olo 10mcg qD. Mean exposure across treatment periods was similar and ranged from 20.7-21 days.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deaths and SAEs:</head><p>There were no deaths reported in this trial. One patient had an SAE (COPD exacerbation and pneumonia) during the 2mcg BID treatment period. The patient fully recovered. This patient was also discontinued from this trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment Emergent AEs</head><p>As there was no washout period between treatment periods, the definition of TEAE for the first 3 treatment periods differed from the last period. For the first 3 periods, TEAEs were defined as those that occurred after the 1 st dose until the last dose of the treatment period. For the 4 th period, TEAEs were defined as those that occurred after the 1 st dose and up to 12 days after the last dose.</p><p>The overall occurrence of TEAEs was higher for the Olo 5 mcg BID compared to other doses (28% versus 20-23%). No dose response was seen for any AE based on SOC. However, based on preferred term, the higher total daily doses (TDD) of olodaterol had more frequent occurrences of nasopharyngitis (2.1% for 4-5mcg TDD versus 6.5% for 10mcg TDD). with previous COPD trial data. There also appears to be no added benefit to olodaterol doses &gt;5mcg daily. With regard to dose interval, based on the totality of the efficacy data, when comparing 4-5mcg TDD divided BID or qD, the qD interval appears to be more optimal, although confirmation of this with data in asthmatics is necessary. Olodaterol was also fairly well tolerated, however, it is difficult to make any safety conclusions as this was a small trial and there was no placebo arm.</p></div>

Following administration of trial medication patients received a series of methacholine challenges. These challenges occurred 0.5, 4, 8, 24, and 32 hours post-dose. PK sampling was performed at prior to dosing, and at 10, 20, 30, and 60 minutes post-dose; and at 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours post-dose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Population</head><p>This study included 31 asthma patients. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concomitant/Prohibited medications</head><p>Patients were not allowed to have been on oral corticosteroids, inhaled corticosteroids, LABA, ICS/LABA, short or long-acting anticholinergics, anti-leukotriene medications, inhaled cromolyn, or theophylline within 3 months prior to the first study visit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Parameters Primary Endpoint:</head><p>The primary endpoint was Log 2 (PC 20 FEV1) at 24 horus following a single dose of olodaterol where PC 20 FEV1 was defined as the provocative concentration of methacholine required to produce a 20% decrease in FEV1</p><p>Secondary Endpoints:</p><p>The secondary endpoint was Log 2 (PC 20 FEV1) at 30 minutes, and 4, 8, and 32 hours post-dose. The following PK parameters were evaluated after the last dose when feasible: 1. Maximum serum concentration 2. Time to maximum serum concentration 3. AUC from time point 0 to the last quantifiable data point during the first dosing interval 4. AUC between time points in the first dosing interval 5. Amount and fraction eliminated in the plasma from 0 to 3 hours</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer comment:</head><p>The primary endpoint of Log2 (PC20FEV1) is not a standard endpoint and is not typically used in COPD/asthma development programs. However, as this was an early phase trial and dosing was confirmed in later trials with endpoints more typical endpoints, this is acceptable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results: Disposition:</head><p>A total of 48 patients were enrolled and 31 were randomized. Five patients total discontinued from this trial. The most common reason for discontinuation overall was withdrawal of consent [2 patients(6.5%)]. The remaining patients who discontinued, discontinued for isolated reasons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographics:</head><p>The patients in this trial were predominantly white (87%), females (55%) with a mean age of 29 years.The average time of asthma diagnosis was 16 years. Mean FEV1 % predicted was 97%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary endpoint:</head><p>For the primary endpoint, PC20s were improved 24 hours following olodaterol administration. The difference from placebo was statistically significant and followed a clear dose response.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse events (AE)</head><p>AEs were assigned to treatments if they occurred on test day and up to 14 days after. Overall AEs occurred most commonly after treatment with placebo (27.6%) compared to after treatment with olodaterol (7.1%-20.7%). Based on preferred term (PT), the most AEs were headache and cough. There was no evidence for dose dependence for any AE. No AEs lead to discontinuation from the trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Labs</head><p>Olodaterol exposure was not associated with statistically significant changes in mean lab value, except for potassium. The Olo 20mcg group demonstrated a small, but statistically significant decrease in serum potassium levels (4.14 mmol/L) compared to placebo (4.34 mmol/L, p&lt;0.0005) at 1 hour post-dose.Similar findings were seen at 2 and 8 hours post-dose. This was not seen for the 2 and 5mcg olodaterol doses. However, the 10mcg olodaterol dose did demonstrate a statistically significant decrease in serum potassium levels at 8 hours post-dose, but not at 1 or 2 hours post-dose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer comment:</head><p>As this was small single dose cross-over trial, safety conclusions cannot be made. However, the statistically significant increase in serum potassium levels for Olo 20mcg at up to 8 hours post-dosing indicate that the 20mcg dose will likely result in adverse reactions known to be associated with beta2-adrenergic agents.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design and Conduct Overview</head><p>This was a 4-week multi-center, randomized, double-blind placebo controlled, parallel group dose ranging trial in patients with asthma who demonstrated reversibility on PFTs. Patients were randomized to receive either placebo or olodaterol at doses of 2, 5, 10, or 20 mcg once daily. Following the screening phase and subsequent 4 week Prior to visit 1, informed consent was obtained and washout of restricted medication began. At visit 1 (week -4 to -6), medication washout was confirmed and pre and postbronchodilator spirometry was performed to assess for reversibility. Patients were also issued an eDiary to record medication use and symptoms. Patients who were determined to be eligible entered the 4 week baseline period. At visit 2, patient eligibility was assessed. Eligible patients were randomized into treatment groups and study drug initiated. At visits 3, 4, and 5 (week 2, 3, and 4, respectively) spirometry was performed pre and post-dose. During these visits unsupervised PFTs were also performed up to 12 hours post-dosing using the Viasys AM2+ device. At visit 6 (week 8), predose PFTs (-10 minutes) were performed. In addition to spirometry, clinical labs, ECGs, AE review, and eDiary review were performed during all visits. The study schedule is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 22</ref>. Timing of procedures for visits 2, 3, 4, and 5 are summarized <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 23</ref>.   Trough FEV1 response after 4 weeks of treatment with olodaterol was the primary endpoint. Trough FEV1 was defined as the mean of FEV1 one hour prior to study drug and 10 minutes prior to study drug. Response was defined as change from baseline. Baseline was defined as the mean of the 2 pre-dose FEV1 measurements (-1 hour and -10 minutes) taken at visit 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary Endpoints:</head><p>The key secondary endpoint was mean peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) response during the last week of treatment. Response was defined as change in mean weekly morning PEFR from baseline.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment:</head><p>The primary endpoint is typical and appropriate for an asthma dose ranging trial. The secondary endpoints are also generally appropriate. However, the utility of unsupervised PFTs is questionable. The PK, safety, and compliance parameters are appropriate.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis Sample Size</head><p>Based on previous trials, BI assumed a standard deviation for trough FEV1 of 0.55 liters. Based on this, BI estimated that a sample size of 80 patients would yield 90% power to detect a 29mL difference from placebo with a two sided p-value of 0.05. This assumes a 25% discontinuation rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Missing Data</head><p>For missing spirometry data, values were estimated using other recorded values for that day. If the value was missing due to rescue medication use, then the least favorable value from that day was used. Estimations were made by linear interpolation of the adjacent data, or by last observed carried forward if no subsequent data was available. However if a single pre-dose measurement was missing, the other pre-dose measurement was used. If both were missing then, pre-dose data from the prior visit was used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis populations</head><p>The sponsor pre-specified 3 analysis populations. The full analysis set (FAS) consisted of all patients with baseline data and evaluable post-dosing data following at least 5 days of randomized treatment for at least one endpoint. The per protocol (PP) data set that consisted of all FAS minus patients with important protocol deviations. The safety population was made up of all treated patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Analysis</head><p>The primary endpoint was to be analyzed using ANCOVA. Analysis was to occur in a step-wise fashion to control for type 1 error. The first comparison was to be between Olo 20mcg and placebo. If that difference were to be statistically significant, then the next lower dose was to be compared to placebo, and so on. If a dose did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference from placebo, subsequent analysis of lower doses would continue, however, would be considered descriptive. Secondary endpoints were to be analyzed in a manner similar to the primary endpoint.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Analysis</head><p>All safety data was analyzed in a descriptive manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results: Protocol Amendments:</head><p>After initial submission of this protocol, there were 3 amendments. The first was submitted 6/11/07. Changes included additional time points for ECG, vital signs, and Clinical Review Robert H. Lim, MD NDA 203,108 Olodaterol inhalation solution PFTs. A second amendment was submitted on 7/27/07. Changes included changing the upper limit of bilirubin and creatinine for exclusionary criteria and allowing for genotyping of select cytochrome P 450 enzymes. The 3 rd amendment was submitted on 3/26/08. Changes included changing the washout period for LABAs from 6 weeks to 2 weeks, and a reduction in sample size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol Violations</head><p>Important protocol violations were defined as violations that could potentially affect the efficacy parameters or safety of the patients. They occurred in 29% of patients in this trial. The most common violations were related to poor compliance ('compliance out of range'). This was higher in the olodaterol groups (12-18%) as compared to placebo (7.4%). However, missing or unreliable compliance data was more common in the placebo group (7.4%) compared to all olodaterol groups (1.6-3.3%). Note that patients in the poor compliance group and missing compliance data group did not overlap. Otherwise, protocol violations were generally similar across treatment groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disposition:</head><p>A total of 426 patients were enrolled and 296 were randomized. Seven patients total discontinued from this trial. Discontinuation was most common in the Olo 2mcg group with 3 (4.9%) patients withdrawing. The most common reason for discontinuation overall was withdrawal of consent [3 patients(1%)]. The other 4 patients who discontinued, discontinued for isolated reasons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment:</head><p>The protocol amendments are unlikely significantly affect data interpretation. The changes were reasonable. The percentages of patients with important protocol violations, while higher than previous trials, were generally evenly distributed across treatment groups. As such systematic bias is unlikely. With regard to the unbalanced compliance related protocol violations, if one groups together the 'compliance out of range' and 'compliance missing or not reliable' categories, the compliance related PVs are generally even across groups. The number of patients who discontinued in this trial was low and is unlikely to affect data interpretation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographics:</head><p>The patients in this trial were predominantly white (87%), females (57%) with a mean age of 45.2 years.The average time of asthma diagnosis was 22 years. Mean FEV1 % predicted was 74% with an FEV1/FVC ratio of 69%. Average reversibility based on FEV1 was 19%. These values were all similar between groups. Demographic information is summarized in Compliance: Compliance was based on eDiary entries. Overall the mean compliance was similar between groups ranging between 87-91%. 78-85% of patients took their medication 80-120% of the time.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: Patient demographic information was generally balanced across treatment groups, as was baseline spirometry data. The characteristics of the trial population were typical for asthmatics. While the compliance is this trial was not poor, it is lower than what one would expect in a 4 week trial and was also lower than the analogous COPD dose ranging trials. This could potentially dilute the treatment effect.</p><p>Clinical Review Robert H. Lim, MD NDA 203,108 Olodaterol inhalation solution descriptive in nature (though p-values were provided). For the analogous FVC AUC (0-6) response data, only the 20mcg olodaterol dose showed a statistically significant difference from placebo (0.191L). For FEV AUC (0-3 hours) response after 1, 2 and 4 weeks of treatment, at all time points and for all doses, olodaterol groups demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared to placebo. For all the AUC related endpoints, there was no dose response. The numerical difference from placebo for the 10mcg dose was consistently less than the 5mcg dose.</p><p>For the secondary endpoints of peak FEV1 response at 0-3 hours post-dose at day 1 and week 1, all doses demonstrated a statistically significant response compared to placebo. For the same parameter at week 2 and 4, only the 20mcg dose demonstrated a statistically significant difference from placebo. For the 10mcg dose at weeks 2 and 4, a statistically significant difference was not seen, and as per the statistical analysis plan, the comparisons to placebo for the 2 and 5mcg doses were only descriptive in nature. For the analogous endpoint for FVC, the results were similar. As with FEV1, only the 20mcg dose consistently demonstrated a statistically significant difference from placebo for all time points. However, the 10mcg dose never demonstrated a statistically significant difference from placebo for any of the timepoints, as such only descriptive analysis was performed for the lower doses. As with the AUC data, there was no consistent dose response for the FEV1 and FVC peak response at 0-3 hours post dose.</p><p>The sponsor endpoints which included unsupervised spirometric measurements did not yield any statistically significant results.</p><p>For the secondary endpoint of weekly mean PEFR response after 4 weeks of treatment, all doses demonstrated a statistically significant difference from placebo (in liters/minute; Olo 2mcg=23, Olo 5mcg=25, Olo 10mcg=37, and Olo 20mcg=43). The results were similar after 1, 2, and 3 weeks of treatment, though the differences were greater in magnitude. For pre-dose morning PEFR response, the difference from placebo at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 were all statistically significant and similar in magnitude to the weekly mean PEFR responses. However, as with the FEV and FVC data, there was no apparent dose response.</p><p>With regard to rescue medication usage, at weeks 1, 2 and 3, all olodaterol dose groups has statistically significantly less rescue medication use compared to placebo. The differences from placebo were all generally ≤1 dose/day. After 4 weeks of treatment the differences from placebo were only statistically significant for the 20mcg. The magnitude of the differences was modest ranging from 0.287-0.593 fewer doses of rescue medications/day.</p><p>The sponsor also analyzed change from baseline in ACQ total score compared to placebo after 4 weeks of therapy. For both the 10 and 20mcg doses, there was a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo of 0.33 and 0.28, respectively. The 2 and 5mcg doses demonstrated a numerical improvement compared to placebo, Clinical Review Robert H. Lim, MD NDA 203,108 Olodaterol inhalation solution however, the difference did not reach statistical significance. Note that overall, the improvements are minimal and of questionable clinical significance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment:</head><p>For the primary endpoint of trough FEV1 response, a statistically significant difference from placebo was only seen for the 20mcg dose, though there were similar trends for the lower doses. There was no trend for a dose response. These data were inconsistent with the COPD dose ranging trials. For the key secondary endpoint (PEFR response), however, all doses demonstrated a statistically significant difference from placebo. It should be noted that in general FEV1 is considered a more robust endpoint parameter than PEFR.</p><p>The results for the FVC and FEV1 related secondary endpoints were consistent with the primary endpoint in that only the 20mcg dose consistently demonstrated statistically significance differences from placebo. For all other doses, the results were variable. There was also no consistent dose response.</p><p>These results are not consistent with the COPD dose ranging trials, where in general, all doses demonstrated a statistically significant treatment effect and a dose response. This lack of consistency may have to do with the size of the trial, the higher percentage of protocol violations, and the lower compliance rates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacokinetic endpoints:</head><p>For the 2mcg dose group, only 1 patient had a detectable level of olodaterol at any time point. For the 5mcg group, less than 1/3 had detectable levels post-dose on day 1; however at more than 1/3 had detectable levels post-dose on day 29. For the 10 and 20mcg dose groups, in more than 1/3 of patients, plasma concentrations could be detected up to 3 hours post-dose on day 1 and and up to 6 hours post-dose on day 29. For the 5, 10, and 20mcg doses, maximum plasma concentrations were observed between 10 and 20 minutes post dosing. Thereafter, decline was rapid. For the 10 and 20mcg doses, steady state was reached at 6 hours post-dose (day 29). The half life at steady state was 28 hours for the 20mcg dose. Half life was not calculated for the other doses due to insufficient data. These results are summarized graphically in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">Figure 8</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety:</head><p>Exposure: Approximately 242 patients were exposed to olodaterol and 54 to placebo for a mean duration of 29 days. Approximately 89% of patients were exposed for &gt;28 days. Exposures were similar between all groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deaths and SAEs</head><p>There were no deaths reported in this trial. There were 2 SAEs reported. One patient in the Olo 10mcg group reported pneumonia and one patient in the in the Olo 20mcg groups reported dizziness, palpitations, hyperhidrosis, and chest pain. The patient in the 20mcg group had a known history of palpitations; however, it had not previously been associated with dizziness or chest pain. Both patients required hospitalization and fully recovered. In both cases study drug was continued during these events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment Emergent AEs</head><p>Any AE occurring after the first dose of study drug until 12 days after the last dose is referred to as a TEAE in the review of this trial. Overall the occurrence of TEAEs was slightly lower in the placebo group (28%) compared to olodaterol groups (30-40%). Based on system organ class, the most common TEAEs were infections and infestation; respiratory mediastinal and thoracic; and nervous system disorders. In general, AEs based on SOC were comparable between groups, though nervous system disorders were more common in the Olo 20mcg group (19.7%) compared to all others (5-11.7%). The most common TEAEs based on preferred term were headache and nasopharygitis.</p><p>Olo 10mcg had QTcF interval changes of &gt;30msec compared to placebo. This was true for ECGs taken 40, 60, and 180 minutes after dosing, but not for ECGs taken 30 minutes pre-dose and 10 minutes post-dose. There was no clear dose response. This is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 30</ref>. With regard to ECG morphology, there was a slightly higher incidence of T wave abnormalities in the 10 and 20mcg groups up to 1 hour post-dose on study day 1. These abnormalities were not associated with AE reports. Reviewer Comment: The significance of the shift table analysis results for hemoglobin, red blood cells, and sodium is of unclear significance. The results for CPK are consistent with previous trials, where increases from baseline were noted. The results for serum potassium are not surprising given that olodaterol is a LABA. It is reassuring that the magnitude of serum potassium changes was small and is likely of little clinical significance. However, it is notable that for the above mentioned lab parameters, the changes from baseline were most obvious in the higher olodaterol dose groups. With regard to the vital sign changes (SBP, DBP, pulse rate), there appears to be a dose response, if the 10mcg dose is ignored. Interestingly, in the efficacy analysis, when a dose response was not demonstrated, it was frequently due to the 10mcg dose group. The observed imbalance in QTcF changes from baseline is somewhat surprising as in BI's TQT study, no significant QT effect was detected, although there was some indication that with increasing doses, the QTc increased. Although this is concerning, the overall numbers are small. This is scrutinized when analyzing the combined safety data sets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall Comments:</head><p>The efficacy results of this trial were not consistent with the previous COPD doseranging trials. Only the 20mcg olodaterol dose consistently demonstrated a statistically significant treatment effect compared to placebo. Additionally, based on most endpoints, there was no dose effect. The disparate results may in part be related to higher number of protocol violations and lower compliance. Given this unexpected result, the trial is not helpful in terms of dose ranging. With regard to safety, olodaterol appeared relatively well tolerated, however there were several (S)AEs that were of some concern (i.e. </p></div>

There was no washout between treatment periods. PFTs were conducted at baseline (prior to any treatment) and at the end of each 4 week treatment period.</p><p>At the initial screening visit (visit 0), consent was obtained. If patients were on LABAs, they were washed out. If patients were an ICS/LABA combination, while the LABA was washed out, they remained on an equivalent dose of ICS. When patients returned for visit 1 (week -2) baseline assessments such as ACQ and PFTs were obtained. Appropriate medication washout was also verified. Patients were given an AM2+ device as their eDairy and instructed how to record PEFR. Rescue medication was also dispensed (salbutamol). Following the 14 day baseline period, patients returned for visit 2 (week 0). At this visit eligible patient were randomized to a treatment sequence. To be eligible, patients must have completed the eDiary at least 80% of the time during the baseline period. Patients then began the treatment phase.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Parameters Primary Endpoint</head><p>The primary endpoint for this trial was FEV1 AUC (0-24 hours) response after 4 weeks of treatment. The FEV1 AUC (0-24 hours) was calculated from spirometric data from the clinic visit at the end of each 4 week treatment period, and divided by 24 hours to report in liters. Baseline FEV1 from visit 2 (defined as mean of FEV1 at -1hour and -10minutes pre-dose) was subtracted from FEV1 AUC (0-24 hours) to determine FEV1 AUC (0-24 hours) response. However, in this trial FEV1 AUC (0-24 hours) data prior to trial medication was not collected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary Endpoints</head><p>The secondary endpoints are as follows:</p><p>1. PEFR at the end of each dosing interval measured by patients at home using the AM2+ device 2. FEV1 AUC (0-12 hours) and FEV1 AUC (12-24 hours) measured following each dosing determined at the end of each 4 week treatment period. 3. Peak FEV1 (L) (within 24 hours post-dose) measured following the evening trial-drug inhalation at the end of each 4 week treatment period. 4. Trough FEV1 (L) at the end of each 4 week treatment period. Trough FEV1 is defined as the mean of the two FEV1 values (performed at 1 hour and 10 minutes prior to the evening trial-drug inhalation) at the end of the dosing interval. 5. Trough forced vital capacity (FVC) (L) at the end of each dosing interval (as defined above for FEV1) determined at the end of each 4 week treatment period. 6. FVC AUC (0-12 hours) and FVC AUC (12-24 hours) and peak FVC (L) (within 24 hours post dose) measured following each dosing determined at the end of each 4 week treatment period. 7. Individual FEV1, FVC (L) and PEFR L/min measurements peak, trough, AUC (0-24 hours) where possible after the first two weeks of each period of randomized treatment. 8. PEFR variability: PEFR variability (L/min) is the absolute difference between morning and evening PEF value divided by the mean of these two values (weekly and overall means obtained after the first two weeks of each period of treatment will be compared). 9. Use of rescue medication during the entire study period 10. Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ (S)) at the end each period of treatment. 11. Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) at the end each period of treatment 12. FEV1 (L): mean pre-dose morning and evening FEV1 measured by patients at home as measured using the AM2+ device during the entire study period.</p><p>13.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis Sample Size</head><p>Based on BI's previous experience, the standard deviation for pair differences in FEV1 AUC (0-24 hours) was estimated to be 250mL. Based on this, BI estimated that a sample size of 84 patients would yield 95% power to detect a 100mL difference from placebo assuming a paired t-test with a 2.5% one-sided significance level. However, as this was an incomplete block cross-over design, BI targeted a sample size of 150 patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Missing Data</head><p>Spirometry:</p><p>During the baseline period, pre-dose missing data were replace with non-missing predose values recorded at the same visit. If both pre-dose values were missing at visit 2, baseline was imputed using the mean of the pre-bronchodilator values from visit 1.</p><p>During the treatment period, trough data missing at an individual time point at visit 3-6 was replaced with the non-missing pre-dose data recorded at the same visit. Post-dose data missing due to worsening symptoms were replaced with the least favorable nonmissing data recorded during the same visit. Post-dose data missing at random were either linearly interpolated if the preceding and subsequent data point was available or were imputed using last observation carried forward. If a patient discontinued or was excluded from the trial due to worsening of symptoms such that there were not 4 week measurements, data was imputed from the patients least favorable non-missing data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient Recorded Data:</head><p>During the baseline period, if fewer than four values were measured in the week immediately preceding the first treatment, enough earlier values were added to obtain four. If fewer than four values were measured in the entire period prior to first inhalation of treatment, all the available data was used.</p><p>During the treatment period, data that was missing or excluded due to worsening of symptoms after the first two weeks of the treatment period was replaced with the least favorable non-missing value recorded within the same treatment period (excluding data from the first two weeks of the period).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis populations</head><p>The sponsor pre-specified 3 analysis populations. The full analysis set (FAS) consisted of all patients with baseline data and evaluable post-dosing data following at least 5 days of randomized treatment for at least one endpoint.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Analysis</head><p>Analysis occurred in a step-wise fashion to control for type 1 error. The first comparison was between Olo 20mcg and placebo. If that difference was statistically significant, then the next lower dose was compared to placebo, and so on. If a dose did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference from placebo, subsequent analysis of lower doses continued, however, was considered descriptive. Analysis was performed on the FAS and the PP population.</p><p>All secondary analyses was performed only on the FAS. Secondary endpoints related to clinic visit spirometry will be analyzed in a manner similar to the primary endpoint. For patient eDiary derived endpoints, analysis was considered exploratory and no correction for multiplicity was made.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Amendments:</head><p>After initial submission of this protocol, there were 3 amendments. Database lock was 2/18/2011. The first amendment was submitted on 1/8/2010 and primarily corrected typographical errors and made some minor changes. The 2 nd amendment was submitted 10/21/2010. The changes were minor. The most notable was allowing for ICS/LABA use during the 2 week follow-up period after all treatment periods were completed. Additionally, instructions were added to account for possible delay in trial medication resupply. In the event that there was a delay in medication resupply, patients were instructed to continue taking medication from their current kit. The 3 rd amendment was submitted 2/16/11. This amendment most notable modified the calculation of primary and secondary efficacy variables involving AUCs. The primary efficacy variable was initially defined as FEV1 AUC (0-24 hours) where the analysis would adjust for baseline value, however, in the amendment, the variable for analysis was to be FEV AUC (0-24 hours) after 4 weeks of treatment -baseline FEV1. A similar change was made for the secondary efficacy variables. This amendment was made to make this protocol more consistent with other BI protocols.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol Violations:</head><p>Of the total randomized patients, 31 were identified as having important protocol violations. Five patients who should have been excluded due to exclusion criteria were included. Fifteen patients who did not meet inclusion criteria were included. Four patients were dispensed wrong trial medication, 3 were non-compliant, 3 had major deviations in PFT timing, and 5 were classified as other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disposition</head><p>A total of 317 patients enrolled in this trial and 198 patients were randomized. The most common reason for non-randomization was inclusion/exclusion criteria. Of the 198 patients, 182 (92%) patient completed. The most common reasons for discontinuation were AEs and non-compliance. Discontinuation was most common during the Olo 10mcg treatment period and least frequent during the Olo 2mcg treatment period. A total of 186 patients were included in the FAS for efficacy analysis. Patient disposition is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 34</ref>.</p><p>The sponsor also analyzed change from baseline in AQLQ(S). The change from baseline for all olodaterol groups was less then the MCID of 0.5, though the differences were statistically significant.</p><p>With regard to symptom free days, both olodaterol and Foradil groups had a higher percentage of symptom free days compared to placebo (placebo=18.5%, Foradil=23.7%, olodaterol doses=21-26%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments:</head><p>The differences from placebo for the non-spirometric endpoints were marginal at best, and do not give support to the efficacy of olodaterol.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety:</head><p>Exposure:</p><p>A total of 198 patients received at least one dose of study medication. The mean exposure per treatment period was approximately 30 days and was similar across all treatments. The overall mean exposure was 111.5 days out of a possible 113 days (29 days for treatment period 1 and 28 days for treatment periods 2-4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deaths and SAEs</head><p>There were no deaths reported in this trial. There were 2 SAEs reported. One patient experienced appendicitis while being treated with Olo 10mcg. One patient had a cerebral infarction that occurred 3 days after the last dose of trial drug. This patient had a history of hypercholesterolemia and previous infarct 3 years prior. This patient had received Foradil, Olo 20mcg, Olo 5mcg and Olo 2mcg.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Withdrawal due to AEs</head><p>Six patients withdrew prematurely due to AEs. Withdrawals occurred during the treatment period for all doses except Olo 20mcg. AEs leading to withdrawal included metrorrhagia in one placebo period patient; headache in one Olo 2mcg period patient; dizziness/headache/muscle spasms in one Olo 5mcg period patient; palpitations in another Olo 5mcg period patient; tooth in infection in one Olo 10mcg period patient; and hypertension in two other Olo 10mcg period patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment:</head><p>Based on the patient narrative, it appears unlikely that the SAEs were treatment related. However some of the AEs that lead to discontinuation were likely related to olodaterol use (i.e. palpitation and hypertension).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TEAEs</head><p>In this trial TEAEs were defined as AEs that occurred after first dose in a treatment period until the day before the next treatment period. Overall, AE were more common during oldaterol treatment periods (10%-16%) compared to placebo periods (4.8%) or formoterol (6.4%). The most common AEs by SOC were infections and infestations, respiratory mediastinal and thoracic, and nervous system. By preferred term, the most common AEs were nasopharyngitis and dyspnea. This is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 39</ref>. Because there was no washout period between treatment periods, the sponsor also analyzed the safety data for AEs that occurred only during week 3 and 4 of the treatment periods. The findings were similar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment</head><p>Lack of a washout period between treatment periods potentially makes interpretation of the safety data difficult. However, based on the available data, there does appear to be clear imbalance in AEs when comparing olodaterol to placebo. There also appears to be a dose response AEs based on the nervous system disorders SOC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Labs</head><p>Except for potassium, labs were drawn at baseline and at end of treatment period only. Based on shift table analysis, for uric acid and CK, shifts from normal to high occurred more frequently on the Foradil group (uric acid=10.3%, CK=23.1%) than when on placebo (uric acid=0%, CK=3.7%) or olodaterol. Otherwise, there were no notable changes in clinical lab values.</p><p>As olodaterol is a beta-agonist, serum potassium was assessed more frequently than other clinical labs. In addition to the standard assessments, levels were drawn 1 hour pre-dose and 1 and 3 hours post-dose at the end of each treatment period. One hour post-dose, for the 5, 10, and 20mcg olodaterol doses, there were statistically significant reductions in serum potassium levels compared to placebo (p&lt;0.05). This was not the Reviewer Comment WIth regard to clinical labs, the effect of olodaterol compared to placebo was minimal. With regard to vital signs, as with the trial 1222.6, marked increases in SBP and DBP were clearly more frequent in olodaterol groups. However, no dose response was evident. For QTcF, there were only minimal changes based on mean values. However, when comparing the percentage of patients who had increases of ≥30msec, although the percentage were low, increases were more frequent in the olodaterol groups compared to placebo. This is similar to what was seen in trial 1222.6, however, the effect was more prominent in this trial. It is possible that this is related to a cumulative dose effect as this was a crossover trial without washout periods. ECG data from the combined data sets will be closely scrutinized for QTc prolongation and related AEs.</p><p>Overall Comments:</p><p>The efficacy results from this trial were remarkably consistent across endpoints. All doses of olodaterol demonstrated a clear bronchodilator effect compared to placebo, and there was a clear dose effect. As with this COPD dose ranging trials, the incremental benefit appeared to decrease with increasing doses. However, this phenomenon was not as clear in this asthma trial compared to the COPD trial. With regard to AEs olodaterol was fairly well tolerated, however, it is of concern that several patients withdrew due to AEs that could have potentially been related to olodaterol. Additionally, there was an obvious imbalance when comparing overall common TEAEs between placebo and olodaterol dose groups, and for the nervous system disorder SOC, there was a dose effect. However, as there was no washout period between treatment periods, interpretation of safety data is difficult. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design and Conduct Overview</head><p>This was a 17 week, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, trial including two parallel 3-way crossovers in patient with moderate to severe persistent asthma. Following the screening period, patients were randomized to receive a treatment sequence consisting of 3 week treatment periods with Olo 2.5mcg BID, Olo 5mcg qD, and placebo; or Olo 5mcg BID, Olo 10mcg qD, and placebo. There were a total of 12 possible treatment sequences. Between each 3 week treatment period, there was a 2 week washout period.</p><p>This trial consisted on 8 trial visits. At visit 1a (week), informed consent was obtained and medication washout began. At visit 1b, medication washout compliance was verified and baseline data was collected. Pre-and post-bronchodilator spirometry was also performed. Patients were also given an AM3 device for use as an eDiary. Following visit 1a, the baseline period began and lasted 2 weeks. During this time patients recorded their PEFR, asthma symptoms, and medication use. At visit 2 (week 0), the treatment period began. Eligible patients were randomized to a treatment sequence and trial medication was dispensed. Following randomization, patients were seen in clinic at weeks 3, 5, 8, 10, and 13 (visits 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively). At visits 4 (week 5) and 6 (week 10), trial medication was dispensed. During trial visits 3, 5, and 7, 24-hour postdose spirometry was performed, in addition to other safety and efficacy assessments. The assessments at visits 2, 4, and 6 were similar, however did not include 24-hour spirometry. The assessment schedule is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 42.</ref> 3.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol Violations:</head><p>Of the total randomized patients (206), 30 patients were identified as having important protocol violations. Of these, 11 patient violations related to inclusion criteria violations, 7 were related to timing deviations in PFT performance, 9 were related to noncompliance, and 1 was related to exclusion criteria violation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disposition</head><p>A total of 279 patients enrolled in this trial and 206 patients were randomized. The most common reason for non-randomization was inclusion/exclusion criteria. Of the 206 patients, 199 (96.6%) patients completed the planned treatment in all 3 treatment periods. Seven (7) patients discontinued prematurely; 1 in the placebo group, 1 in the Olo 5mcg BID group, 1 in the Olo 10mcg qD group, 2 in the Olo 2.5mcg BID group, and 2 in the Olo 5mcg qD group. The reasons for discontinuation were non-compliance (3 patients), withdrawal of consent (2 patients) and adverse events (2 patients).

The mean exposure per treatment period ranged between 22.8-23.4 days. In each treatment period, the majority of patients (58-70%) were exposed for 16-22 days.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deaths, SAEs, withdrawal due to AEs</head><p>There were no deaths during this trial. There were 4 reported SAEs. Three were related to hospitalizations due to falling (patient was inebriated), to gastroenteritis, and to diverticulosis. The fourth SAE was due to a meniscal tear requiring arthoscopy. Two patients withdrew due to AEs; one for asthma exacerbation (Olo 5mcg BID treatment period) and one for weight gain (Olo 2.5mcg BID treatment period).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TEAEs</head><p>In this trial TEAEs were defined as AEs that occurred after first dose in a treatment period until 12 days after the last dose in a treatment period. Overall, AEs occurred with similar frequency during oldaterol treatment periods (12.7%-18.8%) and placebo periods (16.4%). The most common AEs by SOC were infections and infestations, respiratory mediastinal and thoracic, and nervous system. By preferred term, the most common AEs were headache and asthma. This is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 49</ref>. With regard to SAEs and AEs, olodaterol was relatively well tolerated. None of the SAEs were likely related to study medication. It is also not unexpected to have asthmatics withdraw from a trial due to an exacerbation. With regard to TEAEs, there were no clear imbalances overall, or with regard to specific AEs. This is in contrast to trial 1222.27, where overall AEs were more frequent in the olodaterol groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Labs:</head><p>Labs were drawn at baseline and at end of treatment period only. Based on shift table analysis, there were no notable shifts in clinical lab values. However, for the 10mcg TDD groups compared to placebo, there were more patients who had normal serum glucose at baseline that increased to above the upper limits of normal after 3 weeks of treatment (placebo=5.7%, 5mcg BID=8.5%, and 10mcg qD=11.5%). There were 5 patients who had reported AEs due to clinical labs. In the placebo group, there was one case of blood in the urine and 1 case of increased CPK. In the 5mcg qD period, there was one case of increased blood creatinine. In the 10mcg qD period, one patient had increase AST and GGT and another had increased blood glucose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vital Signs:</head><p>The number of patients with changes in blood pressures or pulse rates was low and generally similar between treatment groups. The frequency of patients with a marked increase in SBP, DBP, or pulse rate was also similar between groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ECG:</head><p>ECGs were performed 60 minutes prior to dosing during study visits. There were no notable changes on ECG for PR, QRS, or QTc intervals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment</head><p>With regard to clinical labs and vital signs, olodaterol was well tolerated. In contrast to the other asthma dose-ranging trials, there were also no changes noted on ECG. This is likely related to decreased frequency of ECG monitoring.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall Reviewer Comment</head><p>As with the previous asthma and COPD dose ranging trials, this trial is supportive of a bronchodilator effect for olodaterol at all studies dose regimens. The results also indicate that BID dosing may offer a greater treatment benefit compared to qD. This is in contrast to the COPD dose ranging trial 1222.6, where the treatment effect differences in BID and qD dosing was marginal. Although BID dosing may confer a greater treatment effect in asthmatics (but not necessarily in COPD patients), the optimum TDD does not change. Based on the totality of the dose ranging data, 5mcg is likely the optimum TDD. With regard to safety, olodaterol was well tolerated in this trial. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives/Rationale</head><p>• To assess the long-term efficacy and safety of olodaterol (5mcg and 10mcg once daily) compared to placebo in patients with COPD</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design and Conduct Overview</head><p>This was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, 48-week parallel group trial to assess the safety and efficacy of two doses of olodaterol (5mcg qD and 10mcg qD) for the treatment of COPD. These COPD patients had FEV1 of &lt;80% predicted and were current smokers, or had at least a 10 pack year smoking history. Asthmatics were excluded. The trial had a total of 11 visits. Consistent with standard of care, background therapy with short-acting beta-agonists, inhaled corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, anticholinergics, and methylxanthines were permitted in all treatment groups.</p><p>Consent was obtained from patients at visit 0, and patients were informed of restricted medications (primarily other LABAs) and began medication washout if indicated. At the screening visit (visit 1, week -2), medication washout was verified and baseline information collected. Baseline spirometry was also performed. Eligible patients then began a 2-week run-in period. Prior to the end of the run-in period, a subset of patients received baseline 24-hour Holter monitoring (N=50/arm). At visit 2, patients were randomized into the 48-week double-blind treatment portion of the trial. During the double-blind treatment period, patients were instructed to record PEFR, symptoms, test medication use, and rescue medication use in their eDiaries. After the randomization visit, there were 9 additional clinic visits (weeks 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 32, 40, 48, and 50). The primary efficacy endpoint was assessed at 12 weeks (day 85); the remainder of the trial was primarily for collection of safety data. PFTs were performed at each clinic visit. At the week 12 visit, a subset of patients received additional post-dose PFTs to characterize the 12-hour FEV1 curve. After the final visit at week 48, there was a solicited vital status follow-up phone call at 50 weeks for all patients including those who prematurely discontinued from the trial. Unsolicited vital status updates were also reported after the trial period. Patients were allowed to continue with inhaled corticosteroids and anticholinergics for the duration of the trial. Note that randomization was stratified based on tiotropium use. Because of this, patients who started on tiotropium during the trial were discontinued. The trial schedule and assessments are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_22">Table 50</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trial Population</head><p>The trial consisted of 625 randomized COPD patients. They were randomized using an interactive voice randomization system (IVRS). Randomization was stratified based on tiotropium use. If the number of patients on tiotropium at baseline exceeded 30% in any region, then enrollment into the tiotropium strata was curtailed. Tiotropium was not discontinued in any patients for the purposes of enrolling in the trial.</p><p>Key Inclusion Criteria 1. All patients signed an informed consent consistent with ICH-GCP guidelines prior to participation in the trial, which included medication washout and restrictions. 2. All patients had a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and met the following spirometric criteria: Patients had relatively stable airway obstruction with a post-bronchodilator &lt;80% of predicted normal and a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt;70% predicted at Visit 1. 3. Male or female patients, 40 years of age or older 4. Patients were current or ex-smokers with a smoking history of more than 10 packyears. Patients who had never smoked cigarettes were excluded. 5. Patients were be able to perform technically acceptable pulmonary function tests (both supervised) and PEFR measurements, and were able to maintain records (Patient Daily e-Diary) during the study period as required in the protocol. 6. Patients were able to inhale medication in a competent manner from the Respimat inhaler and from a metered dose inhaler (MDI).</p><p>Key Exclusion Criteria 1. Patients with a significant disease other than COPD 2. Patients with clinically relevant abnormal baseline haematology, blood chemistry, or urinalysis; all patients with an AST (SGOT) &gt;2x ULN, ALT (SGPT) &gt;2x ULN, bilirubin &gt;2x ULN or creatinine &gt;2x ULN were excluded regardless of clinical condition (a repeat laboratory evaluation was not be conducted in these patients) 3. Patients with a history of asthma. For patients with allergic rhinitis or atopy, source documentation was required to verify that the patient did not have asthma. If a patient had a total blood eosinophil count 600/mm^3, source documentation was required to verify that the increased eosinophil count was related to a non-asthmatic condition.</p></div>

Patients who had taken an investigational drug within one month or six half lives (whichever is greater) prior to Screening Visit (Visit 1) 13. Patients with known hypersensitivity to beta-adrenergics drugs, EDTA or any other component of the Respimat inhalation solution delivery system 14. Pregnant or nursing women 15. Women of childbearing potential not using two effective methods of birth control (one barrier, one non-barrier method).

Patients who had previously been randomized in this study or were currently participating in another study 17. Patients who were unable to comply with pulmonary medication restrictions prior to randomization Enrollment Cautions: 1. Extreme caution was used when including patients: -with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency and hypertension being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants 2. Caution was used when including patients on treatment with non potassium-sparing diuretics 3. Patients should not have been normally taking beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, e.g., prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with COPD. In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution. 4. The randomization of patients with any respiratory infection or COPD exacerbation in the 6 weeks prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) or during the baseline period should be postponed. Patients may be randomized 6 weeks following recovery from the infection or exacerbation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethics:</head><p>This trial was conducted according to the principles of Good Clinical Practice, the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki (1989), and ICH guidelines. An institutional review board reviewed and approved this protocol. No changes were made without the IRB's approval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis Sample Size</head><p>Based on the Applicant's previous experience, the standard deviation for FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) was estimated to be 226mL and for trough FEV1 was 225mL. BI estimated that a total of 76 patients/group would yield 90% power to detect a 120mL FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) response with a one sided alpha of 0.025. To have 90% power to detect a 75mL difference in trough FEV1 between olodaterol and placebo, 191 patients/group were required. As such BI planned to randomize 200 patients/group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Missing Data</head><p>Data missing due to worsening symptoms were replaced with the least favorable nonmissing data recorded during the same visit. Post-dose data missing at random was either linearly interpolated if the preceding and subsequent data points were available or was imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF). If the adjacent data points were not available, then data were also imputed using LOCF. If a patient discontinued or was excluded from the trial due to worsening of symptoms, data was imputed from the patient's least favorable non-missing data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis populations</head><p>The sponsor pre-specified 3 analysis populations. The full analysis set (FAS) consisted of all patients who received study drug and had baseline data and at least one evaluable post-dosing data for either co-primary endpoint. The per protocol set (PPS) consisted of all FAS minus patients with important protocol deviations. If the PPS was &lt;90% of the FAS, the primary analysis was to have been performed on the PPS as a sensitivity analysis. The safety population was made up of all treated patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Analysis</head><p>The co-primary endpoints were analyzed in a hierarchical manner to protect against type 1 error. The analysis first compared FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) response for the olodaterol 10mcg group to placebo, then compared trough FEV1 response. If the 10mcg dose was superior to placebo (one sided p-values 0.025), then the 5mcg dose was compared to placebo for the co-primary endpoints. The FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) response and trough FEV1 response data was analyzed using a mixed effect model for repeated measures.</p><p>Analyses of the secondary endpoints were considered descriptive and the p-values did not account for multiple comparisons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>Protocol Amendments There was one protocol amendment. This was submitted on 1/10/2010. This amendment included corrections of typographical errors and clarification of the timing of some trial assessments. The amendment also increased the sample size from 510 to 600 patients in response to results from other olodaterol trials and olodaterol/tiotropium fixed dose combination trials. Results from these trials demonstrated that when LABAs were used on a LAMA background the FEV1 responses were smaller than previously expected. As patients in these trials were allowed to be on tiotropium, BI readjusted the sample size to account for a smaller than expected treatment difference. As such, BI changed their proposed sample to 191 patients per group, which would yield 90% power to detect a difference of 75mL in trough FEV1 between olodaterol groups and placebo (one sided p-value of 0.025). Additionally, BI reduced the cap on the number of patients allowed to be on concomitant tiotropium (60% to 30%).</p><p>In addition to the above protocol changes, there were also changes to the planned statistical analysis. Notable changes are discussed. The FAS definition was modified to included all patients who received at least one dose of study medication and had both baseline and at least one post-baseline measurement at or before Day 85 for either coprimary endpoint. The previous definition required measurements for specifically the first co-primary endpoint. Moderate COPD exacerbation related secondary endpoints were also added. A pooled analysis of COPD exacerbations was also added (trials 1222.11, 1222.12, 1222.13, 1222.14). Note that this was changed in a subsequent amendment to the statististical analysis plan. These changes were made prior to database lock and were considered by the Applicant to be the 'planned' analysis.</p><p>The Applicant also made alterations to their statistical analysis plan following database lock. The treatment-by-tiotropium stratum interaction terms were removed from the statistical model after database lock and unblinding. This was removed because it resulted in the calculation of the adjusted means for treatment as the unweighted average of the means of each stratum. This reduced the treatment effect and increased variability. The Applicant provided numbers for both the pre-specified analysis and the amended analysis. Using the original analysis, olodaterol's treatment effect compared to placebo was of lesser magnitude compared to the amended analysis. The Applicant also did not perform analysis of the pooled data for COPD exacerbation, as the results across the individual trials were not consistent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment:</head><p>The changes to the protocol do not affect data interpretation. The pre-database lock changes to the statistical analysis plan were also reasonable. However, the changes made to the statistical analysis plan after database lock and unblinding are problematic. As these changes were made after unblinding, the results of this post-hoc analysis should not be used as the basis for efficacy conclusions. The co-primary endpoints were re-analyzed by FDA statisticians using the pre-specifed analysis plan. Note that the sponsor's pre-specified analysis was not provided in the body of the clinical study report; it was provided in an appendix. As their results matched the FDA analysis, the sponsor performed pre-specified analysis will be presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol Violations</head><p>A total of 27 (4.3%) patients had important protocol violations (IPV). An important protocol violation was defined as a violation that could potentially affect the interpretation of the efficacy of safety data. The most common violation was 'study medication taken significantly longer than planned treatment durations' (end of treatment plus 2 weeks). Important protocol violations are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 52</ref>. Two patients (#3428 and 3040) received a different study drug treatment prior to the primary endpoint (visit 5, week 12) than was received at the beginning of the trial. These two For the secondary endpoint of FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) response after 48 weeks of treatment, the olodaterol 10mcg and olodaterol 5mcg dose groups had differences from placebo of 0.169L and 0.173L (p-values &lt;0.0001), respectively. At days 1, 43, 85, 169, and 337 (weeks 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48, respectively), the results were similar, all with pvalues &lt;0.0001. The magnitude for the differences from placebo during these time points for the olodaterol 5mcg group were 0.165, 0.17, 0.172, 0.174, and 0.173L, respectively. For olodaterol 10mcg, the differences from placebo at the same time points were 0.175, 0.167, 0.176, 0.161, and 0.169L, respectively. These results are represented graphically in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 11</ref>. For the secondary endpoint of trough FEV1 response over the 48-week period, both olodaterol doses demonstrated an increase in response compared to placebo on all tested days [days 15, 43, 85, 169, and 337 (weeks 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48, respectively)]. The mean differences from placebo in liters for olodaterol 5mcg were 0.095, 0.095, 0.091, 0.086, and 0.091 at days 15, 43, 85, 169, and 337, respectively. For the olodaterol 10mcg group, the differences from placebo in liters at the same time points were 0.111, 0.091, 0.101, 0.089, and 0.091 L, respectively. P-values for both doses at all time points were &lt;0.0001. This is represented graphically in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 12</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment</head><p>The results for the secondary endpoints related to FEV1 and FVC were supportive of a bronchodilatory effect for olodaterol. As with the primary endpoint, there was no incremental benefit for the 10mcg dose over the 5mcg dose with regard to FEV1-related secondary endpoints. Over the 48 week treatment period, spirometric responses for the olodaterol groups compared to placebo appeared to exhibit a downward trend. These results implied that the bronchodilatory effect may wane over the 48-week treatment period. Additionally, when comparing the treatment effect between 6 and 12 weeks (days 43 and 85), the treatment effects were of similar magnitude. However, it should be noted that the secondary analysis was amended post-database lock/unblinding, and did not protect against type 1 error.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-spirometric secondary endpoints:</head><p>For the secondary endpoint of daily rescue medication use (measured weekly) over the 48-week treatment period, both olodaterol dose groups demonstrated less rescue medication use (albuterol) compared to placebo. At weeks 1, 12, 24, and 48, the difference from placebo ranged from 0.51 to 1.1 puffs per day for olodaterol 5mcg (pvalues from 0.0048-0.0005) and from 0.56 to 1.5 puffs per day for olodaterol 10mcg (pvalues &lt;0.0001-0.002).</p><p>The results for the secondary endpoints of daytime and night-time rescue medication use over the 48-week treatment period were similar. At weeks 1, 12, 24, and 48, the mean differences from placebo for daytime rescue medication use in olodaterol 5mcg were 0.15 (p=0.051), 0.47 (p=0.007), 0.434 (p=0.0025), and 0.52 (p=0.0045) puffs/day respectively. For olodaterol 10mcg mean differences from placebo were 0.16 (p=0.03), 0.54 (p=0.002), 0.56 (p&lt;0.0001), and 0.65 (p&lt;0.0004), respectively. Results for nighttime rescue medication use were similar.</p><p>The number and time to first COPD exacerbation were also evaluated as secondary endpoints. For time to first COPD exacerbation, moderate COPD exacerbation, and first COPD exacerbation leading to hospitalization, there were no statistically significant differences between olodaterol and placebo groups. However, there was a trend for earlier exacerbations in the placebo group versus olodaterol groups based on hazard ratios <ref type="table" target="#tab_22">(Table 58</ref>). There were also no statistically significant differences with respect to number of exacerbations between groups. However, there was a trend for fewer exacerbations (any and moderate) in both olodaterol groups versus placebo as demonstrated by hazard ratios &lt;1.</p><p>An additional 4 patients died after early discontinuation of study treatment (Placebo=2, Olo 5mcg=1, Olo 10mcg= 1) and were reported as part of the solicited vital status follow-up <ref type="table">(Table 60</ref>). The olodaterol 10mcg patient died due to a small bowel obstruction and the olodaterol 5mcg patient died of multiorgan failure (COPD exacerbation per MAC). The placebo patients died of "unknown" and multiple organ failure (unknown and cerebrovascular accident per MAC).</p></div>

There was no evidence of dose response for any of these AEs. Common TEAEs (&gt;3%) are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 63</ref>. Forty one patients experienced administration-related bronchospasm (≥15% decrease in FEV1 post-dose or rescue medication use). Administration-related bronchospasm was more common in placebo (13.4%) than olodaterol 5mcg or 10 mcg groups (2.4% and 3.9%, respectively).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer comment:</head><p>The deaths reported in this trial were not necessarily surprising given the patient population. The small imbalance seen in the total SAEs is of some concern, as is the small imbalance seen in the nervous system and cardiac disorder SOCs, and the atrial fibrillation PT. However, the overall numbers were small and analysis of the larger pooled safety data set would likely be more informative. The common AEs were typical for what one would expect in a COPD program.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spirometric Secondary Endpoints</head><p>This trial included multiple FEV1-related secondary endpoints. A subset of patients (TPS) received 12 hour post-dose spirometry at week 12. For these patients, FEV1 AUC (0-12 hours) response was compared between olodaterol groups and placebo. Results demonstrated that the olodaterol 10mcg and olodaterol 5mcg groups had a difference from placebo of 0.089L (p=0.0011) and 0.110L (p&lt;0.0001), respectively. These results are summarized graphically in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 14</ref>. Sensitivity analysis using unadjusted means (original pre-specified analysis plan) demonstrated similar results. For the secondary endpoint of FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) response after 48 weeks of treatment, the olodaterol 10mcg and olodaterol 5mcg dose groups had differences from placebo of 0.161L and 0.158L (p-values &lt;0.0001), respectively. At days 1, 43, 85, 169, and 337, the results were similar, all with p-values &lt;0.0001. The magnitude for the differences from placebo for the olodaterol 5mcg group at days 1, 43, 85, 169, and 337 were 0.164, 0.169, 0.151, 0.165, and 0.161L, respectively. For olodaterol 10mcg, the differences from placebo at the same time points were 0.171, 0.161, 0.143, 0.136, and 0.158L, respectively. These results are represented graphically in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 15</ref>. For the secondary endpoint of trough FEV1 response over the 48 week period, both olodaterol doses demonstrated an increase in response compared to placebo on all tested days (days 15, 43, 85, 169, and 337). The mean differences from placebo in liters for olodaterol 5mcg were 0.053, 0.073, 0.047, 0.069, and 0.068 at days 15, 43, 85, 169, and 337, respectively. For the olodaterol 10mcg group, the differences from placebo in liters at the same time points were 0.065, 0.085, 0.048, 0.058, 0.072, and 0.071L, respectively. P-values for both doses at all time points were &lt;0.01. This is represented graphically in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 16</ref>. Note when using the original analysis, the differences from placebo were smaller and the p-values were larger. For the secondary endpoint FEV1 peak (0-3) response over the 48 week period, both olodaterol doses demonstrated an increase in response compared to placebo on all tested days. The mean differences from placebo in liters for olodaterol 5mcg were 0.168, 0.144, 0.164, and 0.155L at days 1, 85, 169, and 337, respectively. For the olodaterol 10mcg group, the differences from placebo in liters at the same time points were 0.177, 0.130, 0.135, and 0.157, respectively. P-values for both doses at all time points were &lt;0.0001.</p><p>The difference from placebo in FEV1 response for the olodaterol 5mcg group at 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes post-dose on Day 1 were 0.120, 0.147, 0.159, 0.170, 0.173, 0.173 L. For olodaterol 10mcg the differences from placebo were 0.118, 0.144, 0.160 L, 0.169, 0.187, and 0.189 L, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment</head><p>The results for the secondary endpoints related to FEV1 and FVC are supportive of a bronchodilatory effect for olodaterol. As with the primary endpoint, there was no incremental benefit for the 10mcg dose over the 5mcg dose. Over the 48-week treatment period, spirometric responses for the olodaterol groups compared to placebo exhibited some time point-to-time point variability, but had an overall downward trend. These results imply that the bronchodilatory effect may wane to some degree over the 48-week treatment period. From 6 weeks to 12 weeks, the treatment effect consistently decreased. This is in contrast to trial 1222.11, where there was no notable difference between weeks 6 and 12. It should be noted that although all the p-values were generally low (&lt;0.05), the analysis was amended post-database lock/unblinding, and did not protect for type 1 error.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-spirometric secondary endpoints:</head><p>For the secondary endpoint of daily rescue medication use (measured weekly) over the 48 week treatment period, both olodaterol dose groups demonstrated less rescue medication (albuterol) use compared to placebo. At week 1, 12, 24, and 48, the difference from placebo ranged from 0.59 to 0.85 puffs per day for olodaterol 5mcg and from 0.6 to 1.2 puffs per day for olodaterol 10mcg (p-values all &lt;0.05).</p><p>The results for the secondary endpoints of daytime and night-time rescue medication use over the 48 week treatment period were similar. At weeks 1, 12, 24, and 48, the mean differences from placebo for daytime rescue medication use in olodaterol 5mcg were were 0.16 (p=0.0628), 0.33 (p=0.0040), 0.38 (p=0.0012), and 0.42 (p=0.0011) puffs/day, respectively. The magnitude of the mean differences from placebo at key study time points (Weeks 1, 12, 24, and 48) were 0.20 (p=0.0242), 0.43 (p=0.0001), 0.50 (p&lt;0.0001), and 0.51 (p&lt;0.0001) puffs/day for the olodaterol 10mcg group, respectively. Results for nighttime rescue medication use was similar, however, for both doses and at all time points, the p-values were &lt;0.05.</p><p>The number and time to first COPD exacerbation were also evaluated as secondary endpoints. For time to first COPD exacerbation, moderate COPD exacerbation, and first COPD exacerbation leading to hospitalization, there were no statistically significant differences between olodaterol and placebo groups. There was also no trend for longer time to first exacerbation for olodaterol versus placebo. There same was true with respect to number of exacerbations between groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PK data</head><p>Post-dosing olodaterol levels were comparable on days 43, 85 and 127. The geometric mean concentration 10 minutes after inhalation was 1.8 fold higher in olodaterol 10mcg versus olodaterol 5mcg. Serum concentrations were also slightly higher in Asians compared to Whites. There was no evidence of a relationship between oldaterol serum levels and serum potassium levels. It should be noted that 7 (0.9%) out of the 768 also had normal CPK levels at baseline and above normal maximum values (placebo=6.3%, Olo 5mcg=10.4%, and Olo 10mcg=18.7%).</p><p>When examining glucose and potassium, the number of patients per group who had normal baseline values and elevated maximum values were similar between groups. Based on mean values, there was also no difference between groups with regard to potassium values.</p><p>When examining potentially clinically significant changes in lab values as defined by the sponsor, numbers were generally similar between groups. Notably, potentially clinically significant elevations in potassium and glucose were similar between treatment groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer comments</head><p>The findings with regard to CPK are not necessarily surprising as it is likely a pharmacodynamic effect of olodaterol. These results are also consistent with what was seen in the dose ranging trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vital signs:</head><p>With regard to SBP, there were no significant differences between groups based on change in mean values or shifts from normal to high. However, a higher percentage of olodaterol treated patients compared to placebo had shifts from normal to low (Olo 5mcg=19.1%, Olo 10mcg=18.9%, placebo=11.1%). With regard to DBP there were no significant differences between groups based on change in mean values, shifts from normal to low, or shifts from normal to high. For pulse rate, there were no significant differences between groups based on change in mean values, shifts from normal to high, or shifts from normal to low. However, more patients in the olodaterol groups had shifts in pulse from normal to markedly elevated compared to placebo (Olo 5mcg=7.2%, Olo 10mcg=6.0%, placebo=3.2%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ECG</head><p>ECGs were assessed as mean changes from baseline, mean changes exceeding a prespecified threshold (450, &gt;480, or &gt;500ms in the QTc interval), mean changes exceeding categorized change (&gt;30ms or &gt;60ms in the QTc interval), notable changes, and frequency of ECG abnormalities. Notable changes were defined as in trial 1222.11.</p><p>Based on these parameters, there were no notable changes from baseline. When analyzing the QTcF based on threshold values (&gt;450ms, &gt;480ms, and &gt;500ms), no imbalances were identified, nor was there any evidence of dose response. However, during the entire treatment period, there were only 6 reported increases of QTcF of &gt;500ms. Of these reported increases, 2 were in the placebo group and 4 were in the olodaterol groups (2 in each dose group). When analyzing the QTcF based on categorized change (&gt;30ms or &gt;60ms), the overall numbers were small for all time points. During the entire treatment period, there were only 11 reported increases of QTcF &gt;60ms. All were in the olodaterol treatment groups. Reports of increases &gt;30ms were more frequent; however, there was neither a clear dose-dependent nor timedependent effect. A prolonged QT interval was reported as an AE for one patient (Olo 10mcg) and decreased T-wave amplitude was reported in 2 patients (both Olo 5mcg). Two placebo patients reported inverted T-waves. The patient with the prolonged QTc interval and one patient with T-wave inversion were discontinued.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Holter monitoring</head><p>With regard to supraventicular couplets, change from baseline at days 85, 169, 281, and 337 were highly variable within groups. Within groups, there were no apparent time related trends. Between groups, there were also no consistent differences. However, change from baseline at day 337 for supraventricular couplets was higher in both olodaterol groups compared to placebo (placebo=3.1, Olo 5mcg=43.5, and Olo 10mcg=29.6).</p><p>The results for supraventicular tachycardia runs were also variable when comparing change from baseline at day 85, 169, 281, 337, though not as variable as the supraventicular couplet data. Within groups, there were no apparent time-related trends, nor were there consistent differences between groups at each time point.</p><p>With regard to ventricular couplets, there were no consistent trends within or between groups. However, the change from baseline at days 169 and 281 was greater in the olodaterol groups compared to placebo. This difference was not maintained at day 337. With regard to ventricular runs, the differences between groups were minimal, and the mean number of runs in each group was small.</p><p>Based on shift table analysis of ventricular premature beats (VPB) and supraventicular premature beats (SVPB), most patients had similar numbers of SVPBs when comparing baseline values to last value on treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment:</head><p>With regard to vital signs, ECG, and holter data, no significant imbalances were seen. Notably, the olodaterol groups did not appear to have an increased frequency of QTcF prolongation as was implied in some of the asthma dose ranging trials. However, the pooled ECG and holter data from the 48 week trials will be analyzed in the combined safety section.</p><p>Overall Reviewer Comment on trial 1222.12 Based on the sponsor analysis of the co-primary endpoints, neither dose of olodaterol is effective at bronchodilation. While both doses did demonstrate a statistically significant treatment effect with respect to FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours), neither did with respect to trough FEV1, though there was a trend for an effect. Compared to trial 1222.11, the treatment effect on trough FEV1 was smaller in magnitude. As with trial 1222.11, this trial allowed for the use of all background COPD medications except for LABAs. As such, patients could also be on tiotropium. The trough FEV1 response in the non-tiotropium strata trended to be larger compared to the tiotropium treated strata. With regard to maintenance of effect, although there was time point to time point variabilty, the magnitude of the treatment effect (based on the primary endpoint) appeared to exhibit a downward trend from 6-48 weeks. There appeared to be no effect on exacerbations and some mild improvement in rescue medication use. With regard to safety, the deaths were fairly well balanced, and the common AEs were generally consistent with what one would expect in a COPD trial. </p></div>

To detect a difference of 120mL in FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) response between olodaterol and placebo with 90% power, 76 patients per group were required (one-sided p-value of 0.025). To detect a difference of 90mL in FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) response between olodaterol and placebo with 90% power, 168 patients per group were required (onesided p-value of 0.025). To detect a difference of 0.7units in TDI focal score between olodaterol and placebo with 90% power, 338 patients per group were required (onesided p-value of 0.025). To detect a difference of 50mL in trough FEV1 between olodaterol and formoterol with 90% power, 427 patients per group were required (onesided p-value of 0.025).

These changes were relatively minor and included revising the storage conditions for formoterol and the addition of Germany as a separate region defined for this trial;previously it had been grouped with Europe.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Changes to the analysis</head><p>As with trials 1222.11 and 1222.12, the following changes to the planned analysis were made. The FAS definition was modified to include all patients who received at least one dose and had both baseline and at least one post-baseline measurement at or before Day 85 for any co-primary endpoint. Moderate COPD exacerbation-related secondary endpoints were also added. A pooled analysis of COPD exacerbations was also added (trials 1222.11, 1222.12, 1222.13, 1222.14). These changes were made prior to database lock and were considered by the sponsor to be the 'planned' analysis. These amendments were consistent with the amendments made to trials 1222.11 and 1222.12.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer comment:</head><p>The protocol amendment does not affect interpretation of data. The IPVs in this trial were more frequent compared to 1222.11/1222.12, however, were in general balanced, except for the above 2 mentioned categories. While the imbalance IPVs could have impacted the treatment effect, the overall numbers are small. Additionally, for both categories of IPV, it is likely that, if there was an effect, in general it would have tended to attenuate the treatment effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disposition</head><p>Of the 1212 enrolled patients, 906 were randomized. Of these, 904 received at least one dose of trial medication. Two patients were randomized, but not treated. One patient withrdrew consent prior to dosing (10477), and one was withdrawn due to inability to perform spirometry prior to dosing (11580). Seven hundred twenty-nine (729) patients (80.6%) completed the trial (175 discontinued). The most common reasons for discontinuations were AEs and withdrawal of consent. Discontinuations were less common in the olodaterol groups compared to placebo. 'Lack of efficacy' and withdrawal of consent as reasons for withdrawal were more common in placebo patients compared to olodaterol and formoterol patients. Of the patients in the treated set, 885 were included in the FAS used for efficacy analysis. Two hundred seven (207) patients received Holter monitoring. Although there was a PPS defined, analysis was not performed using this set, per the analysis plan (PPS analysis was only to be performed if the difference between the FAS and PPS were &gt;10%). Patient disposition and analysis populations are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 78</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment</head><p>The results for the secondary endpoints related to FEV1 and FVC were supportive of a bronchodilatory effect for olodaterol compared to placebo. As with the primary endpoint, there was no consistent incremental benefit for the 10mcg dose over the 5mcg dose with regard to FEV1 related secondary endpoints. Over the 48 week treatment period, spirometric responses for the olodaterol groups compared to placebo appeared decrease over time. At the day 337, for both the trough FEV1 response and FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) response and at both olodaterol doses, there was a decrease in treatment effect. Note that for formoterol this was not observed. This implies that there may be some decrease in treatment effect overtime.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-spirometric secondary endpoints:</head><p>For the secondary endpoint of weekly mean daily rescue medication use over the 48week treatment period, both olodaterol dose groups demonstrated less rescue medication use compared to placebo. At each weekly timepoint, the mean reduction for both olodaterol doses ranged from 0.733 to 1.413 fewer puffs/day with p-values ranging from&lt;0.0001 to 0.0023). A similar trend was seen for formoterol (0.455 to 0.986 fewer puffs/day); p-values ranged from &lt;0.0001 to 0.0758.</p><p>The results for the secondary endpoints of daytime and night-time rescue medication use over the 48-week treatment period were similar. For both olodaterol doses, the difference from placebo in weekly mean daytime rescue medication use ranged from 0.248 to 0.574 puffs/day with p-values ranging from &lt;0.0001 to 0.04. A similar trend was seen for formoterol; however, as with the total daily rescue medication use, p-values sometime crossed the 0.05 threshold. Results for nighttime rescue medication use were similar.</p><p>The number and time to first COPD exacerbation were also evaluated as secondary endpoints. For time to first COPD exacerbation, moderate COPD exacerbation, and first COPD exacerbation leading to hospitalization, there were no statistically significant differences between olodaterol and placebo groups. There was also no trend for a treatment effect when comparing olodaterol to placebo. The results with respect to number of exacerbations between groups was also similar. When comparing formoterol to placebo for the same parameters, there was a trend for longer time to first exacerbation and time to first moderate exacerbation. The same trend was seen for number of exacerbations.</p><p>(0.4%). Based on overall SAEs, there was no dose response. When examining the respiratory mediastinal, and thoracic SOC, there was mild imbalance. This appeared to be driven by the COPD exacerbations, which occurred more frequently in the olodaterol 10 mcg group. It should also be noted that the SAE atrial fibrillation also appeared to have a mild imbalance. As the numbers are small, conclusions cannot be drawm on the basis of this trial. These events will be further evaluated in section 7 Review of Safety. patients in the olodaterol groups also had normal CPK levels at baseline and above normal maximum values (placebo=12.1%, Olo 5mcg=15%, Olo 10mcg=13%, and formoterol=20.9%).</p><p>When examining glucose and potassium, the numbers of patients per group who had normal baseline values and elevated maximum values were similar between groups. When comparing mean difference from placebo in serum potassium (at day 43 and 85 at 1 and 3 hours post-dose) both olodaterol 5mcg and olodaterol 10mcg at day 85 and 3 hours post-dose were statistically significantly decreased compared to placebo (p&lt;0.02). However, the magnitude of the difference is likely not clinically significant and ranged from 0.099 and 0.097 mM/L.</p><p>When examining potentially clinically significant changes in lab values as defined by the sponsor, numbers were generally similar between groups. However, the potentially clinically significant elevations in glucose were somewhat more frequent in the olodaterol groups compared to placebo (placebo= 1.6%, Olo 5mcg=3.3%, and Olo 10mcg=2.4%).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ECG</head><p>ECGs were assessed as mean changes from baseline, mean changes exceeding a prespecified threshold (450, &gt;480, or &gt;500ms in QTc interval), mean changes exceeding categorized change (&gt;30ms or &gt;60ms in QTc interval), notable changes, and frequency of ECG abnormalities. Notable changes were defined as in trial 1222.11.</p><p>Based on these parameters, there were no notable changes from baseline. When analyzing the QTcF based on threshold values (&gt;450ms, &gt;480ms, and &gt;500ms), no imbalances were identified, nor was there any evidence of dose response. However, during the entire treatment period, there were 14 reported increases of QTcF of &gt;500ms, and none were in the placebo group (Olo 10mcg=8, Olo 5mcg=2, formoterol=4). When analyzing the QTcF based on categorized change (&gt;30ms or &gt;60ms), the overall numbers were small for all time points. During the entire treatment period, there were 15 reported increases of QTcF of &gt;60ms (placebo=4, Olo 5mcg=5, Olo 10mcg=4, formoterol=2). Reports of increases &gt;30ms were more frequent, however, there was no clear dose dependent nor time dependent effect. Based on ECG findings, 2 patients discontinued the trial [10322 (Olo 10mcg) and 12102 (formoterol)]. For both patients the PT was prolonged QT.</p></div>

With regard to ventricular tachycardia runs, the differences between groups were minimal, and the mean change from baseline in the number of runs in each group was small.</p><p>Based on shift table analysis of ventricular premature beats (VPB) and supraventicular premature beats (SVPB), most patients had similar numbers of SVPBs when comparing baseline values to last value on treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment:</head><p>With regard to vital signs, ECG, and holter data, no significant imbalances were seen. These results were consistent with trials 1222.11 and 1222.12. Notably, the olodaterol groups did not appear to have an increased frequency of QTcF prolongation as was implied in some of the asthma dose ranging trials. However, the pooled ECG and holter data from the 48 week trials will be analyzed in the combined safety section.</p><p>Overall Reviewer Comment on trial 1222.13 Based on the sponsor analysis of the primary endpoints, both doses of olodaterol are effective bronchodilators. The 10 mcg dose of olodaterol offers no added benefit compared to the 5 mcg dose. It should be noted that the difference from placebo with respect to trough FEV1, is relatively small compared to other bronchodilators; however, this trial allowed for the use of all background COPD medications (including tiotropium) except for LABAs, which may have affected results. The trough FEV1 response in the non-tiotropium strata trended to be larger compared to the tiotropium treated strata for olodaterol 10mcg and formoterol, but not olodaterol 5mcg. It should be noted that compared to trial 1222.12, the treatment effect with respect to trough FEV1 response was larger and similar in magnitude to trial 1222.11. With regard olodaterol's effect over time, there appears to be a slight downward slope,which implies that the treatment effect may wane somewhat over time. With regard to SGRQ, based on analysis of this trial only, while there was a statistically significant effect, the effect is not likely clinical significant as it is less then 4, the MCID, for both olodaterol doses. Neither olodaterol dose appears to have any effect on the TDI score. There appears to be no effect on exacerbations and some mild improvement in rescue medication use. With regard to safety, the deaths were fairly well balanced between treatment groups. Based on investigator analysis, there were no imbalances between treatment groups for causes of death; however, based on MAC assessments COPD as a cause of death occurred only in the olodaterol groups during the treatment period. The most common SAEs were COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, infective exacerbation of COPD, atrial fibrillation, and acute respiratory failure. Common TEAEs were also fairly consistent with the COPD population. While some numerical imbalances were seen, overall numbers were small and conclusions cannot be drawn. </p></div>

One death occurred beyond the planned observation period. This occurred in a patient receiving formoterol; the cause of death was aspiration pneumonia. Per MAC the cause of death was asphyxiation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SAEs</head><p>One-hundred-fifty-nine (159) patients experienced SAEs (placebo=20.4%, Olo 5mcg=14.7%, Olo 10mcg=17.5%, and Foradil=15.5%). The most common SAEs were COPD exacerbation (7.2%), pneumonia (1.6%), dypsnea (0.5%), atrial fibrillation (0.4%), pulmonary embolism (0.4%), and respiratory failure (0.4%). There were no imbalances between groups with regard to SAEs based on SOC. However, based on PT, pneumonia was more frequent in olodaterol 10mcg compared to all other groups. <ref type="table" target="#tab_22">Table 95</ref> summarizes SAEs. This table includes PTs that occurred in ≥2 patients. Additionally, if a PT that occurred in &lt;2 patients was similar to a PT that occurred in ≥2 patients, that PT was also listed in the SAE table (e.g. cardiac failure, cardiac failure acute, and cardiac failure congestive).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Labs:</head><p>Based on mean lab values, there were no notable changes in lab values. With regard to CPK, mean changes from baseline were -13 U/L, 6 U/L, 23 U/L and -276 U/L for the placebo, olodaterol 5mcg, olodaterol 10mcg, and formoterol groups. Similar numbers of patients in the olodaterol groups also had normal CPK levels at baseline and above normal maximum values (placebo=2%, Olo 5mcg=5.6%, Olo 10mcg=9.5%, and formoterol=14.8%).</p><p>When examining glucose and potassium, the percentage of patients per group who had normal baseline values and elevated maximum values were similar between groups. There were also no mean differences in serum glucose from baseline compared to end of treatment. When comparing mean difference from placebo in serum potassium (at day 43 and 85 at 1 and 3 hours post-dose) statistically significant decreases were only seen in the olodaterol 10mcg and formoterol groups compared to placebo (p=0.0223 and 0.0398, respectively). However, the magnitude of the difference is likely not clinically significant and ranged from 0.089 and 0.080 mM/L. When examining potentially clinically significant changes in lab values as defined by the sponsor, numbers were generally similar between groups. Notably, potentially clinically significant decreases in potassium were marginally more frequent in placebo (0.9%) compared to olodaterol (0-0.04%) and formoterol (0.5%) groups. The same was true for potentially clinically significant increases in glucose (2.8% versus 1.8-2.3%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vital signs:</head><p>With regard to SBP, there were no significant differences between groups based on change in mean values or shifts from normal to high or normal to low. When using maximum on-treatment values to assess for marked increases in patients with a normal baseline, marked increases in SBP were more common in the olodaterol (Olo 5mcg=2.2%, Olo 10mcg=1.7%) and formoterol (2.6%) groups compared to placebo (0.9%). With regard to DBP there were no significant differences between groups based on change in mean values, shifts from normal to low, or shifts from normal to high. Marked shifts in DBP were more frequent in placebo patients compared to olodaterol and formoterol. For pulse rate, there were no significant differences between groups based on change in mean values or shifts from normal to high. However, more patients in the olodaterol groups had decreases in pulse compared to placebo (Olo 5mcg=11.3%, Olo 10mcg=8.6%, placebo=9.9%, formoterol=5.2%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ECG</head><p>ECGs were assessed as mean changes from baseline, mean changes exceeding a prespecified threshold (450, &gt;480, or &gt;500ms in QTc interval), mean changes exceeding categorized change (&gt;30ms or &gt;60ms in QTc interval), notable changes, and frequency of ECG abnormalities. Notable changes were defined as in trial 1222.11. Based on these parameters, there were no notable changes from baseline. When analyzing the QTcF based on threshold values (&gt;450ms, &gt;480ms, and &gt;500ms), no imbalances were identified, nor was there any evidence of dose response. However, during the entire treatment period, there were 8 reported increases of QTcF of &gt;500ms, and none were in the placebo group (Olo 10mcg=7, Olo 5mcg=1, formoterol=0). When analyzing the QTcF based on categorized change (&gt;30ms or &gt;60ms), the overall numbers of patients experiencing a &gt;30 or &gt;60 ms change were small for all time points. During the entire treatment period, there were only 23 reported increases of QTcF of &gt;60ms (placebo=3, Olo 5mcg=5, Olo 10mcg=3, Formoterol=12). Reports of increases &gt;30ms were more frequent; however, there was neither a clear dosedependent nor time-dependent effect. No patients discontinued based on ECG findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Holter monitoring</head><p>With regard to supraventicular couplets, change from baseline at days 85, 169, 281, and 337 were variable within groups. Within groups, there were no apparent time= related trends. Between groups, there were also no consistent differences.</p><p>The results for supraventicular tachycardia runs was also variable when comparing change from baseline at day 85, 169, 281, and 337. Within groups, there were no apparent time-related trends, nor were there consistent differences between groups at each time point.</p><p>With regard to ventricular couplets, at all time points the mean number of ventricular couplets increased compared to baseline versus for the olodaterol 5mcg. This is in contrast to trial 1222.13, where the opposite was observed. For olodaterol 10mcg, at all time points the mean number of ventricular couplets decreased compared to baseline. With regard to ventricular runs, the differences between groups were minimal, and the mean change from baseline in the number of runs in each group was small.</p><p>Based on shift table analysis of ventricular premature beats (VPB) and supraventicular premature beats (SVPB), most patients had similar numbers of SVPBs when comparing baseline values to last value on treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment:</head><p>With regard to vital signs, ECG, and holter data, no significant imbalances were seen. Notably, the olodaterol groups did not appear to have an increased frequency of QTcF prolongation as was implied in some of the asthma dose ranging trials. However, the pooled ECG and holter data from the 48 week trials will be analyzed in the combined safety section.</p><p>Overall Reviewer Comment on trial 1222.14 Based on the sponsor analysis of the primary endpoints, both doses of olodaterol are effective bronchodilators. As with the other 48 week COPD trials, the 10 mcg dose of olodaterol offers no added benefit compared to the 5 mcg dose. Also similar to the other 48 week trials, the difference from placebo with respect to trough FEV1, is relatively small; however, this trial allowed for the use of all background COPD medications (e.g tiotropium) except for LABAs. The treatment response in the non-tiotropium strata tended to be smaller/similar compared to the tiotropium-treated strata. With regard to maintenance of effect, the treatment effect with respect to trough FEV1 decreased over time. There appears to be no effect of olodaterol on exacerbations and some mild improvement in rescue medication use. With regard to safety, the deaths were fairly well balanced, as were overall SAEs. </p></div>

The three 6-week treatment arms included placebo, olodaterol 5mcg, and olodaterol 10mcg. Between each treatment period, there was a 2-week washout period. Following the initial screening visit (visit 1), patients entered the 2 week run-in period. At visit 2, a baseline constant work rate exercise (CWRE) test was performed. At visit 3 (day 1), patients were randomized into their treatment sequence, and treatment period 1 began. They returned to clinic after 6 weeks (visit 4) of treatment for repeat testing. After visit 6 and a 2 week washout period, patients returned to clinic for the next treatment period. For treatment periods 2 and 3, there were also 2 clinic visits, one for initiation of therapy and baseline assessments (5 and 7), and a second visit (6 and 8) for repeat assessments and exercise testing. A follow-up visit occurred approximately 2 weeks after the last clinic visit. The trial schedule is summarized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 24</ref>. The assessments performed at each visit are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_66">Table 98</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concomitant/Restricted Medications:</head><p>Patients were allowed to taking ICS, xanthines, and short-acting anticholinergics during the trial. However, LABAs and tiotropium were not permitted. Medications taken by the patient within 3 months of the screening visit were recorded in the eCRF. All medications used during the trial were also recorded in the eCRF. Use of SABAs was allowed as necessary; however, if a patient required SABA treatment during exercise testing, the testing was stopped. Temporary increases in the dose or addition of oral steroids and theophylline were allowed, but if increased use occurred within 7 days prior to a clinic visit, the visit was postponed (up to 14 days). The use of antibiotics was not restricted, although clinic visits were postponed for at least 2 days, but not more than 7 days.

Testing was performed 2 hours post-dosing.</p><p>In order to minimize variability in exercise test performance (both incremental cycle ergometry and constant work rate ergometry) between sites, the sponsor attempted control for physiological, biomechanical, and psychological factors that could have affected performance.</p><p>To control for physiological factors, the sponsor encouraged patients not to eat within 2 hours of exercise testing and to maintain adequate hydration. The labs where the testing was performed also maintained temperature and humidity sufficient to keep patients comfortable. Patients were encouraged to stay well-rested prior to testing and to avoid strenuous activity the morning of testing. Patients were also asked to avoid strenuous activities to which they were not accustomed for 2-3 days prior to testing visit to avoid muscle soreness.</p><p>To control for biomechanical factors, the equipment was adjusted to the patients' comfort and the setting determined at baseline was maintained for subsequent testing.</p><p>To control for psychological factors, external motivational cues were controlled across subjects and across sites. Visual cues regarding time were also kept away from the patients' view. Verbal encouragement was also limited to one member of the team who was blinded to the results of the lung function tests. Additionally, the tone of encouragement was to be 'enthusiastic and supportive,' but not 'overbearing, overly loud or coercive.' External incentives for performance were also prohibited. Research staff also explained to patients that there was no specific time limit with any of the testing and that patients were to continue to exercise for as long as they could.</p><p>Research staff also minimized distraction and familiarized patients with the testing and what to expect. Patients were also encouraged to wear appropriate clothing.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer comment</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis Sample Size</head><p>Based on BI's previous experience, the standard deviation of within-subject treatment difference for endurance time on a log10 scale was assumed to be approximately 0.181 seconds. As such, in order detect a 15% difference in endurance time (ET) with 90% power (type 1 error rate 0.05) then a sample size of 102 patients was required. Therefore, BI planned to randomize 150 patients with the assumption of a 20% drop-out rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Missing Data</head><p>There was no imputation for endurance times; if rescue medications were administered during exercise visits, then any recorded data afterward was set to missing. If there was missing spirometric data on visits 3, 5, and 7 (beginning of each 6 week treatment period), values were not imputed. If patients required rescue medications during clinic visits 4, 6, and 8 (end of each 6 week treatment period), then PFTs at the time of rescue were considered missing and values were imputed using the least favorable prior observation. If the entire visit was missing, because a patient discontinued due to worsening disease, then data was imputed by worst observation carried forward for the previous visit. If post-dose data was missing, pre-dose data was used for imputation;however if no pre-dose data was available, then the post-dose value was considered missing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis populations</head><p>The sponsor pre-specified 3 analysis populations. The full analysis set (FAS) consisted of all patients who received study drug and had baseline data and any evaluable postdosing data for the primary endpoint. The per protocol set (PPS) consisted of all FAS minus patients with important protocol deviations. The safety population was made up of all treated patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Analysis</head><p>In order to protect against type 1 error, analysis of the primary endpoint was performed in a hierarchal manner. The first comparison was between olodaterol 10mcg and placebo. If that result was significant, the olodaterol 5mcg was compared to placebo. If the first comparison failed, the second comparison was considered exploratory/ descriptive. Analysis of the key secondary endpoints was performed in a similar manner. For analysis of the other secondary endpoints, there was no protection against type 1 error, nor alpha corrections for multiple comparisons.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol Amendments</head><p>There was a single local amendment (Germany) submitted on 1/14/2010 which clarified blood pressure monitoring during exercise testing. Subgroup analyses based on baseline ET (quartiles) and baseline locus of symptom limitation were also added.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol violations</head><p>A total of 32 (21.2%) of the total 151 randomized patients had important protocol violations. The sponsor prospectively defined an important protocol violation as a deviation that could potentially affect the interpretation of the efficacy of safety data. Of the 32 important protocol violations, 24 had violations that were deemed by the sponsor to potentially affect efficacy. The most common violation was improper washout of medication, occurring in 7.9% of patients. As there was a greater than 10% difference between the FAS and PPS, sensitivity analysis was performed on the PPS.</p><p>(37222) who experienced a COPD exacerabation, trial medication was continued. It is unclear why patient 37222 was not discontinued from the trial as exacerbation was a withdrawal criterion. During the olodaterol 5mcg treatment period, the SAEs were COPD exacerbation, diabetic nephropathy, and fibula fracture. The patients reporting fracture and COPD exacerbation both discontinued. During the olodaterol 10mcg treatment period, the SAEs were atrial fibrillation and COPD exacerbation (n=2). One patient with a COPD exacerbation discontinued. All patients, except for the patient with atrial fibrillation, recovered.</p><p>Ten patients discontinued due to TEAEs. This was more common in the placebo (n=4) and olodaterol 5mcg (n=4) compared to olodaterol 10mcg (n=2). Aside from COPD exacerbation, all were isolated events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment Emergent AEs</head><p>TEAEs were defined as those that occurred after the first dose and up to 12 days after the last dose. The most common TEAEs were COPD, dyspnea, and nasopharyngitis. None of the three demonstrated a dose response. Based on preferred term, insomnia, headache, and diarrhea demonstrated a dose response. Common TEAEs (≥2%) are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 109</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vitals signs</head><p>The number of patients with changes in blood pressures or pulse rates was similar between treatment groups.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer comments</head><p>As this was a cross-over trial, it is difficult to interpret safety data. However, overall, olodaterol was fairly well-tolerated. The SAEs and AEs noted were typical of a COPD trial. The lab changes were minimal. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol violations</head><p>A total of 22 (14.0%) of the total 157 randomized patients had important protocol deviations (same definition as in trial 1222.37). Of these, 15 had violations that the sponsor deemed to have potentially affected efficacy. Deviations included use of prohibited medications (n=5), not meeting inclusion criteria (n=3), primary endpoint recorded outside of specified window (n=3), medication taken outsie of window (n=3), and non-compliance [only 1 puff daily (n=1)]. These patients were excluded from the PPS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disposition</head><p>Of the 204 enrolled patients, 157 were randomized and received at least one dose of medication. Of the randomized patients, 133 (84.7%) completed all treatment periods. The most common reason for discontinuations was AEs. Discontinuations were similar between treatment periods, though somewhat more frequent in the olodaterol groups. Patient disposition and analysis populations are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 110</ref>. It should be noted that, as in trial 1222.37, patients were allowed to withdraw between or during treatment periods, and were given the option of continuing in the next treatment period. Note that in the analyses of the various endpoints, the 'N' was often lower than the FAS. This was due to missing, non-imputed data (i.e. data that was assigned as missing due to the analysis plan). statistically significant effect at the 1 hour post-dose time point, but not at trough.This implies that while olodaterol 5mcg may improve FRC, its effect is transient and does not span the dosing interval. Alternatively, FRC may be less sensitive at detecting lung hyperinflation compared to IC. There was no consistent effect on TLC, though this is not surprising as TLC is derived from FRC+IC. These results are consistent with trial 1222.37. With regard to the FEV1/FVC/PEFR-related endpoints, these are consistent with the data from the 48-week trials.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design and Conduct Overview</head><p>This was a randomized double-blind, double-dummy, placebo controlled 4-way crossover trial to characterize the 24-hour FEV1 time profiles of olodaterol (5mcg and 10mcg once daily) and formoterol (12mcg BID). Each of the four treatment periods lasted 6 weeks, and periods were separated by a 2 week washout period. At visit 0, consent was obtained and washout of prohibited medications began. Rescue medications (albuterol) and a symptom diary were also dispensed. At visit 1, eligibility, compliance, and appropriate washout were confirmed. Baseline spirometry was also obtained. After visit 1, patients entered a 2 week run-in phase. At visit 2 (or visits 5, 8, and 11 for the other treatment periods), PFTs were performed at 1 hour and at 10 minutes prior to morning dose of medication. Post-dose PFTs were performed at 30 minutes, 1, 2, and 3 hours. Test medication was also dispensed. At visit 3, (week 3 of treatment) (or visits 6, 9, and 12 for other treatment periods), test medication was dispensed, but PFTs were not performed. At visit 4, (after 6 weeks of treatment)(visits 7, 10, and 13 for other treatment periods), 24 hour post-dose spirometry was performed. Two weeks after the last treatment period, the patients were seen for their final follow-up visit. The trial schedule is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 119</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer comment</head><p>The trial design was generally reasonable for a phase 3 COPD trial meant to characterize the 24-hour FEV1 profile of a once daily LABA. However, it should be noted that the in the 12-24 post-dosing period, there is an 8 hour gap in FEV1 data (hours 14-22). Additionally, spirometry was assessed after only 6 weeks of treatment. Based on the data from the 48 week COPD trials, it is unclear if 24 hour spirometry from the 6 week time point is representative of the later time points (i.e. 12 and 24 weeks). In 3 of the 4 forty-eight week trials, between week 6 and week 12, the FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) response and trough FEV1 response decreased in magnitude, though was fairly similar when taking the whole 48 weeks into consideration. The inclusion/exclusion criteria were also appropriate for a COPD trial.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis Sample Size</head><p>Based on BI's previous experience, the standard deviations for FEV1 AUC (0-12 hours) was estimated to be 160mL and for FEV1 AUC (12-24 hours) were 140mL.

However, overall, olodaterol was fairly well tolerated. The SAEs and AEs noted were typical of a COPD trial. However, the dose response seen in the cardiac disorder SOC is concerning, especially as it appears to be driven by the PT atrial fibrillation. However, given that the total number of atrial fibrillation events is very small (3 patients total) and that this was a cross-over trial, it is difficult to attribute this to olodaterol. It should be noted that atrial fibrillation was not reported in any of the 48 week COPD trials as a common AE. The presence of a potential cardiac safety signal was carefully analyzed in the summary of safety (section 7).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Review of Efficacy</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Summary</head><p>The proposed indication for the product Olodaterol inhalation solution (Olo) for the longterm, once daily maintenance bronchodilator treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. The proposed dose is 5mcg (2 actuations of 2.5mcg) once daily inhaled via the Respimat device once daily. In their development program the sponsor explored higher doses of olodaterol, however, no significant benefit to increased dosing was seen. In addition to the proposed indication, the sponsor included label claims for increased exercise tolerance and decreased lung hyperinflation. These claims would be unique to this product class. No other LABAs carry these claims. Support for efficacy is derived primarily from the four parallel group 48-week COPD trials, two of which were conducted primarily in the United States (US) and two of which were conducted primarily in Europe (EU). These trials shared the same spirometric coprimary endpoints of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) AUC (0-3 hours) response and trough FEV1. The two US trials (1222.11 and 1222.12) were 3-arm trials which assessed the co-primary endpoints after 12 weeks of treatment. The two EU trials (1222.13 and 1222.14) were 4-arm trials including the active comparator formoterol and assessed the co-primary endpoints after 24 weeks. Trials 1222.13 and 1222.14 also included a third non-spirometric co-primary endpoint of Mahler Transitional Dyspnea Index (TDI) score assessed at 24 weeks and the key secondary endpoint of the Saint George's Respiratory Questionanaire (SGRQ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bronchodilator effects</head><p>In three (1222.11, 1222.13, and 1222.14) of the four 48 week COPD trials, olodaterol 5mcg demonstrated significant improvements in both spirometric co-primary endpoints. For trial 1222.12, results were only statistically significant for FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) response, but not trough FEV1 response when using the protocol-specified analysis. The difference from placebo for FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) response in trials 1222.11, 1222.12, 1222.13, and 1222.14 were 0.164, 0.134, 0.151, and 0.129L (all p-values &lt;0.0001), respectively. For trough FEV1 response, the differences from placebo were 0.084 (p=0.0002), 0.033 (p&gt;0.05), 0.078 (p=0.0002), and 0.053L (p=0.006), respectively. Based on these results, the effect size was relatively modest with respect to trough FEV1. However, this may have been in part related to concomitant medications, as patients were allowed to continue on all maintenance COPD medications, except for LABAs. In these trials approximately 20-25% of patients were on tiotropium as background therapy. When the sponsor performed a stratified analysis based on baseline tiotropium usage, the difference between strata was not statistically significant. In the 6-week trials 1222.39 and 1222.40 in which LAMAs were prohibited as background therapy, the treatment effect of olodaterol 5mcg on trough FEV1 after 6 weeks of treatment was higher at 0.133 and 0.134L, respectively (p&lt;0.0001). It should also be noted that in trials 1222.13 and 1222.14 the treatment effect of olodaterol 5mcg was similar to the active comparator fomoterol.</p><p>Efficacy was further supported by the spirometric secondary endpoints in these trials. These secondary endpoints included FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) response at days 1, 43, 85, 169, and 337; and trough FEV1 response at days 15, 43, 85, 169, and 337. At all time points and across all the 48 week trials, olodaterol 5mcg demonstrated a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo. The magnitude of the treatment effect at these time points was similar to that of the co-primary endpoints. It is of note that secondary endpoint analyses were not corrected for multiple comparisons. In distinction to the spirometric endpoints, olodaterol 5mcg had no statistically significant effect on Mahler TDI scores. With regard to SGRQ, while there were statistically significant differences between olodaterol 5mcg and placebo, the differences were consistently less than the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 4.</p><p>Overall, based on the totality of the data, olodaterol 5mcg appears to have a clinically significant effect on bronchodilation. Although the magnitude of the treatment effect is somewhat modest in the 48-week trials, this may be related to the baseline COPD medications allowed in those trials. Whether or not this modest treatment effect in the setting of other baseline medications is sufficient to warrant a bronchodilator claim for olodaterol will be a topic of discussion at the PADAC meeting. The outcome of the discussion may affect the clinical recommendation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects on exercise tolerance</head><p>To support their labeling claims for increased exercise tolerance, increased inspiratory capacity (IC) at rest and at end exercise, and reduced lung hyperinflation based on decreased functional residual capacity (FRC), the sponsor submitted the results from trials 1222.37 and 1222.38. These were 6-week treatment period cross-over trials with a primary endpoint of exercise endurance time (ET) during constant workrate cycle ergometry (CWRCE) at 75% maximal workload after 6 weeks of treatment. Maximal workload was determined using incremental cycle ergometry performed prior to receiving any trial medication. Key secondary endpoints included IC and intensity of breathing discomfort at isotime. Isotime was defined as ET. CWRCE was performed 2 hours after trial medication was administered.</p><p>ET after 6 weeks of olodaterol 5mcg was statistically significantly greater than after 6 weeks of placebo. The treatment difference was 12-14% or 40-50 seconds across the two trials [baseline 374-414 seconds (geometric mean)]. ICs were also increased at isotime and at rest (trough and 1 hour post-dose) after receiving olodaterol 5mcg compared to placebo. Statistically significant differences for breathing discomfort as measured by the Borg Category Ratio Scale (BCRS) were only reported in trial 1222.37 and not 1222.38. This lack of replication implies that olodaterol does not improve breathing discomfort. For FRC, while it was statistically significantly decreased 1 hour post dose when comparing olodaterol 5mcg to placebo, this was not the case for the trough value. These data imply that the olodaterol 5mcg effect on FRC was not durable over the dosing interval. The clinical significance of the effect of olodaterol 5mcg on exercise tolerance and lung hyperinflation will be a topic for discussion at the PADAC meeting. The outcome of the discussion may affect product labeling.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.1">Methods</head><p>Support for efficacy is derived primarily from the four parallel group 48-week COPD trials, two of which were conducted primarily in the United States (US) and two of which were conducted primarily in Europe (EU). These trials shared the same spirometric coprimary endpoints of FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) response and trough FEV1. The two US trials (1222.11 and 1222.12) were 3 arm trials which assessed the co-primary endpoints after 12 weeks of treatment. The two EU trials (1222.13 and 1222.14) were four arm trials including the active comparator formoterol and assessed the co-primary endpoints after 24 weeks. Trials 1222.13 and 1222.14 also included a third non-spirometric coprimary endpoint of Mahler TDI score assessed at 24 weeks and the key secondary endpoint of SGRQ.</p><p>These 4 trials were adequately designed to assess for efficacy. However, the statistical analysis plans for trials 1222.11 and 1222.12 were modified post-database lock/unblinding. As such, the modified analysis was not used to evaluate for efficacy, but rather the protocol pre-specified analysis. The individual 48 week COPD trials are reviewed in depth in section 5.3 Discussion of Individual Studies/Clinical Trials.</p><p>To support their label claims for increased exercise tolerance, increased inspiratory capacity (IC) at rest and at end exercise, and reduced lung hyperinflation based on functional residual capacity (FRC), the sponsor submitted the results from trials 1222.37 and 1222.38.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.4">Analysis of Primary Endpoint(s)</head><p>All four 48-week trials (1222.11, 1222.12, 1222.13, and 1222.14) shared two spirometric co-primary endpoints, which were trough FEV1 response and FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) response. Trough FEV1 was defined as the mean of the FEV1 obtained at 1 hour and 10 minutes prior to daily trial medication. FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) was defined as area under the curve from 0 to 3 hours post-dose using the trapezoid rule, divided by the time duration. Response for both parameters was defined as change from baseline. For trials 1222.11 and 1222.12, the co-primary endpoints were assessed after 12 weeks of treatment, whereas in trials 1222.13 and 1222.14 the co-primary endpoints were assessed after 24 weeks of treatment. Both spirometric co-primary endpoints are appropriate and are commonly used in COPD trials. The trough FEV1 is meant to demonstrate persistence of effect throughout the dosing interval and the FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) is meant to characterize initial effect. The 12 and 24-week time points are also appropriate as per COPD Guidance for Industry. Results for the spirometric co-primary endpoints are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 136</ref>. Note that for trials 1222.11 and 1222.12, results shown are for the pre-specified analysis, not the post-hoc analysis. Also note that the post-hoc analysis for trials 1222.11 and 1222.12 were the same as the prespecified analysis for trials 1222.13 and 1222.14. For trial 1222.11 and 1222.12, the results at week 24 were similar to the results at week 12, and vice versa for 1222.13 and 1222.14.</p><p>Despite the statistical significance for most of the FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) and trough FEV1 response data, it should be noted that the treatment effect based on trough FEV1 response was modest. This may be partially due to the fact that trial patients were allowed to continue COPD background therapy, such as LAMAs (i.e. tiotropium) and ICS. Approximately 20-25% of the treated patients were on tiotropium at baseline across the 48-week trials across treatment groups.</p><p>Due to potential dilution of effect, the sponsor also performed a stratified analysis based on baseline tiotropium use. In the trial protocols, randomization was stratified based on baseline tiotropium use. This stratified analysis was exploratory in nature and did not correct for multiple comparisons. For the FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) endpoint, both the tiotropium and non-tiotropium strata demonstrated a statistically significant difference from placebo in all trials. For the trough FEV1 endpoint, in the non-tiotropium strata, all olodaterol groups demonstrated a statistically significant difference from placebo; however the results were mixed for the tiotropium strata. In trial 1222.11, the tiotropium strata for both olodaterol doses did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference from placebo. This was also true for the 10mcg olodaterol dose in trial 1222.13. For both endpoints, in most cases, the difference from placebo was numerically larger in the non-tiotropium strata compared to the tiotropium strata, except for olodaterol 5mcg in trials 1222.13 and 1222.14. These results are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 137</ref>.</p><p>Per the pre-specified analysis plan, the results from these 2 trials were pooled for analysis. Based on the combined analysis, there was no statistically significant improvement for either olodaterol dose compared to placebo. This was consistent with the results from the individual trials. A responder analysis was also performed (responder defined as a Mahler TDI focal score ≥1). In trial 1222.13, there were minimal differences between percent responders when comparing olodaterol groups (Olo 5mcg=59.4%, Olo 10mcg=59.4%) to placebo (55.7%). Results were similar for trial 1222.14 (Olo 5mcg=51.6%, Olo 10mcg=53.6%, placebo=49.3%).</p><p>Based on the spirometric co-primary endpoints from the majority of the 48 week trials, both olodaterol doses have a statistically significant bronchodilatory effect compared to placebo. The 10mcg dose demonstrates minimal incremental benefit over the 5mcg dose, and for both doses, the olodaterol treatment effect is modest. While the bronchodilatory effect is a statistically significant, whether the effect is clinically significant is a matter for discussion at the PADAC.</p><p>Based on pooled and individual trial analysis of TDI, olodaterol does not improve dypsnea. Note that as olodaterol did not demonstrate a treatment effect based on TDI and because TDI was a co-primary endpoint for trials 1222.13 and 1222.14 using a hierarchical approach to control for Type I error, analysis of all secondary endpoints for trials 1222.13 and 12222.14 are descriptive only.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key secondary endpoints</head><p>In order to support the proposed indication, the 48 week COPD trials had multiple shared secondary endpoints. However, only trials 1222.13 and 1222.14 had key secondary endpoints. These were as follows:</p><p>• Trough FEV1 response after 24 weeks of therapy in olodaterol groups versus formoterol • FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) response after 24 weeks of therapy in olodaterol groups versus formoterol. • Total SGRQ after 24 weeks of therapy in placebo versus olodaterol groups versus formoterol</p><p>The applicant is not seeking a claim for superiority or equivalence to formoterol. Results comparing trough FEV1 and FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) between olodaterol and formoterol will not be discussed (see individual trial reviews, section 5.3). Results comparing total SGRQ data between placebo and olodaterol groups will be discussed as the sponsor proposes a claim that olodaterol 5 mcg significantly improves SGRQ total score as compared to placebo. The SGRQ label claim is relatively novel, as only one US product (indacaterol maleate) for COPD includes information regarding SGRQ in the product  Rescue medication use was generally lower in the olodaterol groups compared to placebo, both in individual trials and in the combined dataset. In trials 1222.11 and 1222.12, the weekly mean daily rescue medication use was lower in both olodaterol dose groups compared to placebo. In trial 1222.11, at weeks 1, 12, 24, and 48, the difference from placebo ranged from 0.51 to 1.1 puffs per day for olodaterol 5mcg and from 0.56 to 1.5 puffs per day for olodaterol 10mcg. In trial 1222.12, at weeks 1, 12, 24, and 48, the difference from placebo ranged from 0.59 to 0.85 puffs per day for olodaterol 5mcg and from 0.6 to 1.2 puffs per day for olodaterol 10mcg. Similar results were seen for trial 1222.13. However, in trial 1222.14, while the olodaterol 10mcg dose consistently demonstrated statistically significant decreases in rescue medication, the 5mcg dose did not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of secondary endpoints</head><p>Results for the secondary spirometric endpoints are consistent with the spirometric coprimary endpoints. Based on the secondary spirometric endpoints, both doses of olodaterol have a bronchodilator effect. This effect is also maintained in the 12 hour post-dosing interval. In the 48 week COPD trials, there is no data regarding the 12-24 hour time interval. The time to onset is fairly rapid occurring within 5-30 minutes postdosing and plateauing thereafter. Again consistent with the co-primary endpoints, there appeared to be minimal incremental benefit to the 10mcg dose versus the 5mcg dose. Overall, spirometric secondary endpoints are supportive of the proposed indication. Results for the non-spirometric endpoint of rescue medication use are also supportive of the proposed indication and consistent with what would be expected given the spirometric results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.6">Other Endpoints</head><p>Exercise Endurance Trials (1222.37 and 1222.38) In addition to the 48 week trials, BI also performed replicate trials (1222.37 and 1222.38) to support the label claim of increased exercise tolerance. This is based on the trials' primary endpoint of endurance time (ET) during constant workrate cycle ergometry (CWRCE) to symptom limitation when performed at 75% maximal work capacity. These trials were also meant to support additional label claims of increased inspiratory capacity at rest and during exercise, and reduced lung hyperinflation based on decreased FRC.</p><p>Label claims related to increased exercise tolerance and exercise testing are entirely novel for LABAs indicated to treat COPD. This is in part due to the multiple issues in the interpretation of exercise data in the setting of a clinical trial. These issues include, but are not limited to, the following: 1) multiple non-disease related factors can influence exercise tolerance, confounding results; 2) lack of agreed upon MCID for ET; and 3) unknown minimum trial duration required to demonstrate a durable effect on ET.</p><p>Interpretation of results should keep these limitations in mind.</p><p>In the trial designs, the sponsor attempted to minimize variability due to non-disease related factors. This was done by giving test sites guidelines under which the testing was to be performed. Test sites were told to encourage patients to maintain adequate hydration, refrain from eating within 2 hours of testing, and avoid strenuous activity prior to testing. Exercise lab temperature and humidity was also maintained to keep patients comfortable. The exercise equipment was also adjusted to the patients' comfort at baseline testing. These settings were maintained for all subsequent testing. To control for motivational factors, verbal encouragement was performed by a single member of the research team. Encouragement was 'enthusiastic and supportive,' but not 'overbearing, overly loud or coersive.' Visual cues regarding time were also kept away from patients. It is unclear how well the guidelines were adhered to between sites and if they would have indeed controlled for non-disease related variability in testing. The sponsor did not address the lack of MCID nor justify the treatment period duration in their protocols nor application.</p><p>Baseline demographic data were generally similar between trials 1222.37/38 and the 48 week COPD trials, except for a larger proportion of Caucasians and males in the exercise trials. Note that LAMAs were prohibited in these trials in distinction to the 48 week trials. It should also be noted that the difference from placebo in 'trough' FEV1 response after at 6 weeks was generally higher in these trials [Olo 5mcg range: 0.089-0.110L; Olo 10mcg range=0.101-0.110L (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 108</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 117</ref>)], compared to the 6 week data in the 48 week trials (Olo 5mcg range=0.064-0.105L, Olo 10mcg range=0.076-0.104L, pre-specified analysis). This is not entirely surprising given the numerical trends seen when comparing the tiotropium strata to non-tiotropium strata from the 48 week COPD trials. These differences should be taken into account when considering the generalizability of the exercise endurance data to the whole COPD population. Note that trough was defined as FEV1 taken at 23:30 post-dose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary endpoint</head><p>The primary endpoint for these trials was ET at 75% maximal work load after 6 weeks of treatment. ET was assessed 2 hours after the morning medication dose. After 6 weeks of treatment with olodaterol 5mcg or olodaterol 10mcg, the ET was statistically significantly greater than after 6 weeks of treatment with placebo. The difference was approximately 11-14% (40-50 seconds). These results are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 139</ref>.</p><p>For the FEV1 AUC (12-24 hours), both olodaterol doses had treatments effects that were generally numerically similar to tiotropium. However, when comparing olodaterol to formoterol, the treatment effect was generally numerically lower. This is not necessarily surprising given that formoterol is dosed BID versus olodaterol qD. It should also be noted that although FEV1 AUC (12-24 hours) were generated, for trials 1222.24 and 1222.25, there were no spirometric measurements from post-dose hours 14-22; and for trials 1222.39 and 1222.40, there were no measurement from post-dose hours 12-22.</p><p>Overall data from these trials demonstrate a statistically significant treatment effect over the entire 24-hour dosing interval. However, whether or not this data is applicable to later time points (i.e. 12 and 24 weeks) and appropriate for inclusion in the label is questionable. In the 48-week COPD trials, in the majority of trials, the treatment effect was numerically greater at 6 weeks versus 12 or 24 weeks. As such, the results from these 6 week treatment period cross-over trials may not accurately reflect the 24-hour spirometry at later time points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.7">Subpopulations</head><p>The sponsor performed multiple subgroup analyses using the co-primary endpoints of FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) and trough FEV1 for trials 1222.  <ref type="bibr">19%)</ref>]. There were also no differences based on tiotropium, ICS, LABA, SAMA, or xanthine use, nor differences based on age ≥65 years. There were also no statistically significant differences in treatment effect based on baseline respiratory parameters. Although no statistically significant differences were noted, there was a trend for an increased spirometric treatment effect in patients with lesser disease severity, higher baseline FEV1, and those who were reversible following albuterol use (≥12%). These trends are not necessarily surprising as olodaterol is a long-acting bronchodilator. For Asian patients and those using xanthines, there was also a trend for a decreased treatment effect. after 4 weeks of once daily treatment with olodaterol at doses ranging from 2-20mcg, patients with COPD had statistically significant improvements in FEV1. In both trials 1222.3 and 1222.5, the incremental benefit of increasing doses was marginal after 10mcg. Additionally, the largest increase in treatment benefit occurred between the 2 and 5mcg doses. These results implied that the optimum total daily dose was between 5 and 10mcg. Trial 1222.26 was meant to determine optimum dosing regimen comparing once daily (qD) to twice daily (BID). Results from this trial were mixed. When comparing qD and BID for the 10mcg total daily dose, BID dosing appeared to have an increased treatment benefit. However when comparing 2mcg BID to 5mcg qD (the sponsor did not have 2.5 mcg formulation at the time of this trial), the once daily dosing appeared superior. Given this lack of clarity and the need to very clearly delineate dosing for LABAs, FDA recommended further dose ranging in asthmatics.</p><p>The asthma dose ranging trials included trials 1222.4, 1222.6, 1222.27, and 1222.29. Trial 1222.4 demonstrated that a single dose of olodaterol at doses ranging from 2-20mcg increased PC20 in a dose-dependent manner. Trial 1222.6 demonstrated that after 4 weeks of once daily treatment with olodaterol at doses ranging from 2-20mcg, asthmatics had numerical improvements in FEV1; statistical significance was only apparent at 20mcg. A clear dose response was also not seen in this trial. Trial 1222.27 demonstrated that following 4 weeks of treatment with doses ranging 2-20mcg once daily, asthmatics had statistically significant improvements in FEV1. In this trial, similar to 1222.4, there was a clear dose response. Also similar to trial 1222.4, the incremental benefit decreased with increasing dose; however, this was not as marked compared to the COPD dose ranging trials. In both trials, the largest incremental benefit was seen between the 2 and 5mcg doses, and was smallest between the 10-20mcg doses. As such, the optimum daily dose, as with the COPD trials appeared to be between 5 and 10mcg daily. Trial 1222.29 was meant to determine the optimum dosing interval in the asthmatic population by comparing the 5mcg and 10mcg total daily dose when given qD versus BID. For both total daily doses, BID dosing appeared to have a small numerical increased treatment benefit compared to qD. However, the difference was modest.</p><p>Based on the COPD and asthma dose-ranging trials, the optimum total daily dose for olodaterol was clearly 5-10mcg. However, the optimum dosing interval was not as clear.</p><p>In the asthma trials, BID dosing appeared superior to qD dosing; and in the COPD trials the results were mixed. However, when examining the totality of the dose regimen trial data (COPD and asthma), the differences between qD and BID dosing were modest. As such, either regimen and either total daily dose was considered reasonable to carry forward into phase 3.</p><p>In the 48-week COPD trials, the sponsor studied 5mcg and 10mcg qD. Consistent with the dose ranging trial, there was little incremental benefit to the 10mcg dosing. As such, the proposed dose of 5mcg qD is appropriate.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Summary</head><p>The safety information for olodaterol 5mcg comes primarily from the 48-week COPD trials. In the 48-week trials, 876 patients were exposed to olodaterol 5mcg and 883 to olodaterol 10mcg for a total of 1,759 exposed patients. An additional 1594 COPD patients were exposed to olodaterol in shorter-term trials, for a total of 3353 COPD patients exposed for any duration during the olodaterol program. Of these patients, 1014 patients were exposed to olodaterol for ≥48 weeks (≥337 days). Five-hundredtwelve (512) asthmatic patients were also exposed to oldodaterol during the development program.</p><p>There were a total of 53 on-treatment deaths in the 48-week trials. These were relatively evenly split between treatment groups (placebo=1.5%, Olo 5mcg=1.5%, Olo 10mcg=1.9%, and formoterol=2.2%). Based on adjudicated data, the most frequent cause of death was COPD exacerbation as expected in this patient population.</p><p>Serious adverse events (SAEs) were also evenly balanced among treatment groups, with 16.4% of placebo patients, 15.8% of olodaterol 5mcg patients, 16.6% of olodaterol 10mcg patients, and 15.0% of formoterol patients experiencing an SAE in the 48 week trials. As expected in this patient population, the most common serious adverse events (SAE) were COPD exacerbation (5.8%), pneumonia (1.8%), all fractures (0.5%), and atrial fibrillation (0.5%). COPD exacerbations were evenly distributed across treatment groups. However, pneumonias were more common in the high-dose olodaterol (Olo) groups (Olo 5mcg=1.6%, Olo 10mcg=2.5%) compared to placebo (1.5%). The same was true of atrial fibrillation (placebo=0.3%, Olo 5mcg=0.6%, Olo 10mcg=0.6%).</p><p>The most common adverse [by preferred terms (PT)] leading to discontinuation were COPD exacerbation (2.2%), dyspnea (0.4%), pneumonia (0.3%), and atrial fibrillation (0.3%). There were not significant imbalances between groups. The most commonly reported treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were COPD exacerbation (28.3%), nasopharyngitis (9.8%), upper respiratory infection (7.5%), dyspnea (3.9%), and bronchitis (3.8%). Of these, only nasopharyngitis was more commonly reported in both olodaterol groups compared to placebo. It should also be noted that there was a marked differential discontinuation in the placebo groups compared to olodaterol groups. Approximately 23% of placebo patients discontinued the 48-week trials early compared to 15-16% in the olodaterol groups. The most common reasons for discontinuation were adverse events (AEs) and lack of efficacy.</p><p>An analysis of major cardiac events (MACE) was also conducted. This analysis demonstrated no imbalances. The sponsor's MACE analysis was also complemented by a cardiovascular assessment based on Standard MedDRA Queries (SMQs). Only in 2 SMQs were imbalances noted when comparing both olodaterol groups to placebo. Adverse events in the SMQ Cardiac arrhythmias sub− SMQ ventricular tachyarrhythmias occurred in 9 (1%), 17 (1.9%), and 12 (1.4%) in placebo, olodaterol 5mcg and olodaterol 10mcg, respectively. It should be noted that AEs in this SMQ occurred most frequently in the formoterol group [9 (2%)]. AEs in the SMQ Cardiac failure (narrow) occurred in 5 (0.6%), 11 (1.3%), and 7 (0.8%) in placebo, olodaterol 5mcg and olodaterol 10mcg, respectively. The noted imbalances were low in frequency, but consistent with the known potential cardiac effects of LABAs.</p><p>An adjudicated analysis of events leading to death, hospitalization, and intubation was also performed in the all COPD patients from the phase 2/3 trials, as well as all the asthma patients from the asthma dose-ranging trials. In the asthma population, there were no asthma-related deaths, hospitalizations, or intubations. There was single respiratory related event (pneumonia), which occurred in a patient who had received olodaterol 10mcg. The analysis of the COPD dataset did not reveal any significant imbalances nor any new safety signals.</p></div>

Pooled safety data from these trials were reviewed in depth and are presented in this section. Safety data from 6 week treatment period cross-over trials (1222.24, 1222.25, 1222.37, 1222.38, 1222.39, 1222.40) were reviewed, however are not presented in depth in this section, as these trials had short treatment periods (6 weeks), were cross-over in design, and had varying washout periods.

However exposure data for the 6 week treatment period cross-over trials and asthma dose ranging trials are summarized in section 7. from these trials were consistent with data from the 48-week COPD trials and did not identify any new safety signals.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.2">Categorization of Adverse Events</head><p>Adverse events were defined as any untoward medical occurrence, including the worsening of a pre-existing condition that occurred in conjunction with the use of trial drug. Serious AEs were defined as AEs that resulted in death, were immediately lifethreatening, required hospitalization/prolongation of hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or were congenital birth defects. All verbatim terms reported by the investigator were coded using MedDRA version 14.1 for the Integrated Summary of Safety (ISS). However for adjudicated deaths, the MedDRA terms used in the original study report were used. The sponsor also grouped AEs based on Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQ)(MedDRA 14.1) and BI defined pharmacovigilance (PV) endpoints.</p><p>The BI defined PV endpoints were created by grouping multiple MedDRA PTs by similar concepts, that did not necessarily correspond to SOCs or high level grouping terms (HLGTs). The PTs included in the PV endpoints were reviewed and were reasonable. Definitions are available in the SCS supplement [table 2.9.1, pp1061-1136 and response to clinical IR dated 11/13/2012 (stroke PV)]. PVs specifically referenced in this review include COPD exacerbation, COPD exacerbation (broad), upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), cough, pneumonia, pharyngitis, bronchitis, and stroke.</p><p>The COPD exacerbation PV is fairly limited and includes only the PTs COPD, infective exacerbation of COPD, and obstructive airways disease. The PV COPD exacerbation (broad) is much more expansive including PTs that could potentially overlap with COPD exacerbation such as bronchitis, increased bronchial secretions, sputum purulent, etc.. The URTI PV included PTs encompassing infections of the nose, sinuses, tonsils, pharynx, and larynx. The LRTI PV included PTs indicative of infections of lung and included abscesses, pneumonias by organism, pneumonia related terms, and bronchitis by organism. The cough PV was limited and included the PTs allergic cough, cough, productive cough. The pneumonia PV included the same pneumonia related PTs found in the LRTI PV. The bronchitis PV included similar bronchitis related PTs as in the LRTI PV. The stroke PV included an expansive list of PTs associated with thrombotic, embolic, occlusive, and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular events.</p><p>MACE analysis was also performed. MACE events were defined as fatal events in the cardiac disorder and vascular disorder SOCs; any events in the SMQ Ischemic heart disease sub-SMQ myocardial infarction (broad) and stroke PV; the PTs sudden death, cardiac death, and sudden cardiac death. Fatal MACE was defined similarly to MACE, however, included only fatalities associated with the SMQ Ischemic heart disease sub-SMQ myocardial infarction (broad) and the stroke PV.</p><p>Treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) are the focus of the analysis in the ISS. TEAEs were defined as any AE with an onset occurring following the first dose of study drug until 12 days after last study drug intake. Trials with tiotropium as a comparator used a period of 21 days after last study drug intake. In cross-over trials, where the next treatment period started &lt;12/21 days after the previous treatment period, the window was shortened to the start of the next treatment period. Post-treatment AEs were defined as those occurring &gt;12 days (or &gt;21 days) after the last dose of study drug and up to trial completion date.</p><p>Two separate adjudicated analysis of deaths and SAEs were also performed by two separate external adjudication committees; one of deaths and the other of SAEs. All causes of deaths occurring in trials 1222.11, 1222.12, 1222.13, and 1222.14 were reviewed by the mortality adjudication committee (MAC). In addition, a separate adjudication committee identified on treatment (i.e. treatment emergent) deaths, hospitalizations, and intubations (composite endpoint) as respiratory related or not. The events were further sub-classified into 4 categories: 1) asthma-related, 2) COPDrelated, 3) pneumonia-related, 4) other respiratoy-related events, or 5) non-respiratory. The adjudication committee analyzed the safety data based on categories 1-5 as a whole (total), categories 1-4 as a whole (respiratory related), and categories 1-3 as a whole (key respiratory events). SAEs that involved hospitalization and/or death were identified by BI. Intubations were identified by the adjudication committee.</p><p>Studies included in this analysis had treatment durations of &gt;7day and which met the following criteria were included in the analysis:</p><p>• All blinded, parallel-arm, randomized, controlled trials that were conducted with olodaterol for the treatment of COPD or asthma • All randomized, double-blind cross-over trials. Only the first crossover period and the washout period immediately following the first part of the crossover period of the trials were assessed. • All trials of olodaterol combination products in which olodaterol was included as a monotherapy arm.</p><p>Five analysis populations were used in the analysis. These were as follows:</p><p>• All-treated safety population I-patients from COPD or asthma trials (active and placebo controlled) who took at least one dose. • All-treated safety population II-patients from COPD or asthma placebo controlled only trials who took at least one dose. • All-treated COPD safety population I-patients who took at least on dose in the COPD trials • All-treated COPD safety population II-patients who took at least on dose in the placebo controlled COPD trials</p><p>• All-treated asthma safety population-patients whoo took at least one dose in the asthma trials Note that as the All-treated COPD safety population I and II were only minimally different as almost all trials were placebo controlled. As such, in the discussion of the adjudicated analysis, only the All-treated COPD safety population I will be discussed. Sub-group analysis of these safety populations were also performed based on various parameters including treatment period and reversibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.3">Pooling of Data Across Studies/Clinical Trials to Estimate and Compare Incidence</head><p>For this application, evidence for safety is primarily derived from pooled data from the 48 week COPD trials (1222.11, 1222.12, 1222.13, and 1222.14). Safety data from these trials will be reviewed in depth in this section. Supportive safety data is derived from 6 week treatment period crossover trials (1222.24, 1222.25, 1222.37, 1222.38, 1222.39 and 1222.40) and asthma dose ranging trials. As these trials were of varying lengths with varying exposures, safety data from these trials were not pooled with the 48 week safety data, and are not presented in section 7 Review of Safety.</p></div>

Including all phases of development, a total of 4,312 patients were exposed to at least one dose of olodaterol monotherapy. Of these, 3353 were COPD patients. Of the COPD patients, 3142 received olodaterol 5 or 10 mcg once daily in Phase 3 parallel group or crossover trials.</p><p>A total of 3104 patients were included in the 48-week trials. Of these patients, 1,759 patients were exposed to olodaterol. The extent of exposure for the 48-weeks trials was similar between treatment groups, with the lowest mean exposure time occurring in the placebo group and the highest in the olodaterol 5mcg group. The majority of patients were exposed to study drug between 282-337 days. Exposure by key analysis date demonstrated that generally similar numbers of patients were exposed to study drug for ≥85, ≥169, ≥330, and ≥337 days. For each of these time points, exposure was the lowest in the placebo group. Exposure data for the 48 week trials is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 145</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.1">Deaths</head><p>In the 48-week trials, deaths were grouped into 4 categories; on treatment, posttreatment, post-study (within vital status follow-up), and post-study (outside of vital status follow-up). On-treatment was defined as events with onset anytime after the first dose of trial medication until 12 days after the last dose. Post-treatment was defined as events with onset greater than 12 days after last dose until trial completion date (48 weeks). Post-study (within vital status follow up) was defined as event with onset after trial completion, but within the vital status follow-up period (48 weeks+14 days). Poststudy (outside of vital status follow-up) was defined as events with an onset after the vital status follow-up period (&gt;48 weeks+14 days). This review will focus on the ontreatment deaths, post-treatment deaths, and post-study deaths (within vital status follow-up). Vital status follow up is important for these trials given the greater number of discontinuations in the placebo group compared to the active treatment groups.</p><p>In the 48-week COPD trials, there were a total of 53 on-treatment deaths. The most frequent causes of death were COPD (n=10), acute respiratory failure/respiratory failure (n=8), and pneumonia (n=7), which were generally balanced between the olodaterol groups and placebo [placebo=13 (1.5%), Olo 10mcg=13 (1.5%), and Olo 10mcg=17 (1.9%)]. Based on SOC, infections and infestations and neoplasms both demonstrated an imbalance. For infections and infestations, this was driven by the preferred term pneumonia. However, the overall numbers were very small as were the differences between the placebo [1(0.1%)] and olodaterol groups [Olo 5mcg=2(0.2%), Olo 10mcg=3(0.3%)]. For neoplasms, the imbalance was not driven by a single preferred term (PT); however, most the neoplasms in the olodaterol groups leading to the imbalance were lung-related (i.e. lung adenocarcinoma, small cell lung cancer, lung After the on-treatment period, there were an additional 23 deaths. Of the 23 deaths, two occurred after the vital status follow-up period. The remaining 21 deaths occurred within the vital status follow-up period. The causes of death were generally consistent with the on-treatment deaths. There were 10, 6, 4, and 3 deaths in the placebo, olodaterol 5mcg, olodaterol 10mcg, and formoterol groups, respectively. These additional deaths did not result in any new imbalances.</p><p>All deaths were also reviewed by a mortality adjudication committee (MAC). On review of the patient narratives, the agency believes the MAC assignments to be more correct. In general, where there were disagreements, the investigator tended to assign cause of death to the terminal cause, whereas the MAC assigned based on root cause (e.g. respiratory failure versus COPD exacerbation). Based on the adjudicated analysis, many of the causes of death attributed to respiratory failure were reassigned to COPD exacerbation <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 149</ref>). Note that compared to Table 150, in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 149</ref> in the olodaterol 5mcg group, pneumonia was not listed as a cause of death. This is likely because in two patients (11836 and 114631), the investigator assigned the primary cause of death as COPD; however, in the CRFs, the AE pneumonia was also listed as contributory for the deaths.</p><p>examining SAEs and common AEs related with the PT COPD exacerbation, this imbalance was not seen (see sections 7.3.2 Nonfatal Serious Adverse Events and 7.4.1 Common Adverse Events). This further supports the assertion that the imbalance in deaths due to COPD exacerbations was not solely related to olodaterol exposure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.2">Nonfatal Serious Adverse Events</head><p>In the 48-week trials, there were 499 (16.1%) patients with on-treatment SAEs. These were balanced across groups. The most common SAEs by preferred term were by far COPD exacerbation (5.8%) and pneumonia (1.8%). SAEs were most commonly reported in the respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal SOC; followed by the infections and infestations SOC. Within infections and infestations, the preferred term 'pneumonia' was more common in olodaterol 10mcg (2.5%) compared to placebo (1.5%); however, this was not the case for olodaterol 5mcg (1.6%) nor formoterol (1.5%). Within the respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal SOC, the preferred term 'pulmonary embolism' demonstrated a mild imbalance, with a frequency of 0 in placebo group, 0.1% in olodaterol 5mcg, and 0.5% in olodaterol 10mcg. COPD exacerbation was also more frequent in the olodaterol 10mcg (6.8%) compared to placebo (6%). This was not the case for either olodaterol 5mcg (4.7%) nor formoterol (5.9%).</p><p>Three SOCs demonstrated an imbalance in both olodaterol doses compared to placebo: neoplasm benign, malignant, and unspecified; musculoskeletal and connective tissues disorders; and injury, poisonings, and procedural complications. For the SOC musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, the most common preferred term was 'back pain', which was more common in olodaterol 10mcg (0.5%) compared to placebo (0) and olodaterol 5mcg (0.1%). For the SOC injury, poisoning, and procedural complications, the most common preferred term was fall, which also followed a dose response. The imbalance seen in the musculoskeletal and connective disorder and injury, poisoning, and procedural complications SOC are unlikely to be related to olodaterol. On review of the SAE narratives, most of the preferred terms in the musculoskeletal and connective tissue SOC were related to a recent injury or exacerbation of existing disease. With regard to the injury, poisoning, and procedural complications SOC, based on review of the narratives, no events were clearly associated with dizziness, syncope, presyncope, hypotension, arrhythmia, chest pain, or palpitations. Most falls and fractures were related to environmental conditions. As such, it is unlikely that these events were directly related to or precipitated by olodaterol. Additionally, these imbalances were small in magnitude.</p><p>Similar to the imbalance seen in deaths related to the SOC neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified, the imbalance seen in SAEs for the same SOC did not appear to be driven by a single PT. However, it did appear to be driven by the high level group term (HLGT) of respiratory and mediastinal neoplasms malignant and unspecified [placebo=2 (0.2%), Olo 5mcg=4 (0.5%), Olo 10mcg=7 (0.8%), formoterol=4 (0.9%)]. The imbalance seen for the SOC neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified is of unclear significance. Given the latency period of lung cancers, it is unlikely that olodaterol was directly causative. However, it is theoretically possible that olodaterol may have unmasked the cancers. Given the small numbers and a patient population prone to lung-related cancers; this imbalance, like the imbalance seen in deaths, is likely due to chance.</p><p>The SAEs are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 151</ref>.</p><p>Adverse Events) and pneumonia common TEAEs (section7.4.1 Common Adverse Events). This may indicate that development of pneumonia is potentially associated with olodaterol use. However, for the pneumonia SAEs, PV, and common TEAEs, the imbalance is consistently most marked when comparing olodaterol 10mcg to placebo. The difference between olodaterol 5mcg and placebo is marginal and not likely clinically significant.</p><p>Notably, there were no imbalances with respect to COPD exacerbation-related PV endpoints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cardiac Safety</head><p>Cardiac related SMQs and PV endpoints were also analyzed. Imbalances were noted in the SMQ cardiac arrthymias sub-SMQs cardiac arrhythmia terms, tachyarrhythmias, and ventricular tachyarrrhythmias. Note that there was significant overlap in the PTs used in these SMQs. In all three sub-SMQs, two out of the three most common PTs that demonstrated an imbalance between olodaterol and placebo (ventricular extrasystoles and ventricular tachycardia) were shared. Additional imbalances were noted in the SMQ cardiac failure and Torsades de pointes/QT prolongation and the sub-SMQ myocardial infarction (broad). Although these imbalances were noted, they were small in magnitude (relative risk &lt;2) and only the sub-SMQs cardiac arrhythmia terms and tachyarrhythmia occurred in more than 2% of patients. No PTs within the SMQs were reported in ≥2% of any treatment group. Imbalances in cardiac related SMQs and PTs are not surprising given that cardiovascular adverse reactions are known class effect of LABAs. It should also be noted that no SMQ/sub-SMQs or PTs demonstrated a dose response, making it less likely that the small imbalances were solely drug-related. Data are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 155</ref>. Analysis of cardiac related PV endpoints demonstrated similar results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4.2">Laboratory Findings</head><p>Clinical laboratories were measured at week 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, and at the end of study visit. Labs were drawn at 1 and 3 hours post-dosing at the 6 and 12 week visits. At week 0, 24, and 48 fasting labs were drawn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chemistries and Hematology</head><p>In general, review of clinical laboratory findings did not identify any specific safety concerns. Mean changes from baseline to the last value on treatment were generally small and similar between groups. Shift table analysis also generally did not demonstrate any significant differences between groups. Possible clinically significant (PCS) lab changes were relatively infrequent and evenly distributed. Notably for serum potassium levels, there were no differences in mean values from baseline to end of treatment between placebo and olodaterol groups. Shift table analysis also demonstrated no differences between groups. PCS lab changes were infrequent and similar in frequency across groups.</p><p>For serum glucose, there were no differences between groups based on mean changes and shift table analysis. However, PCS increases for serum glucose were slightly more common in olodaterol 5mcg (3.7%) compared to placebo (2.6%). This was not dose dependent (Olo 10mcg=2.8%).</p><p>For CPK, analysis based on mean serum concentrations and shift table consistently demonstrated differences between olodaterol groups to placebo. For serum CPK, there was a mean change between baseline and last value on treatment of 27 U/L (median 12U/L) for olodaterol 10mcg compared to -1 U/L (median 4 U/L) for olodaterol 5mcg and -22 U/L (median -8 U/L) for placebo. CPK levels at week 12 and 24 were also compared to baseline. The results were similar. Note that in these analyses, the change from baseline for the olodaterol groups was lesser in magnitude than for the formoterol group. Shift analysis also demonstrated differences in CPK when comparing baseline values to those at the end of trial. For the placebo group, 2.5% of patients shifted from a normal baseline to greater than the upper limits of normal. This is in contrast to olodaterol 5mcg and olodaterol 10mcg, where the frequencies were 6.7% and 8.7%. The frequency in formoterol patients (12.7%) was greater than both placebo and olodaterol groups. A similar shift analysis was performed comparing baseline CPK values to maximum during the trials. The results demonstrated a similar trend. For placebo, olodaterol 5mcg, olodaterol 10mcg, and formoterol, the frequencies were 8.2%, 14.1%, 17.7%, and 21.4%, respectively. Based on this data, olodaterol exposure clearly affects serum CPK levels in a dose dependent manner. However, the magnitude of this effect appears to be less than formoterol, an approved product. While the mean change from baseline was greater in the olodaterol groups compared to placebo, the mean change for olodaterol 5mcg was still negative. There is a clear relationship between olodaterol exposure and increased CPK levels. However, it should also be noted that only patients in the olodaterol 10cmg group (5) reported the AE of CPK difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline correction was 3.4 (7.1), 5.9 (9.6) ms, 7.4 (10.9) ms and 8.5 (12.4) ms following doses of 10, 20, 30 and 50 mcg, respectively. Therefore, at doses greater than 10mcg, QT prolongation was observed. The QT-IRT consult also stated that "Pre-dose QTc measurements in Phase 3 parallel group studies at weeks 6, 12, 24 and 48 are not suggestive of a delayed effect at the therapeutic dose."</p><p>During the 48 week COPD trials,12-lead ECG data was obtained on all participants. ECGs were performed at days 1, 43, 85, 169, and 337. Based on mean values, there were no significant changes from baseline in heart rate, PR interval, and QRS interval. Mean changes from baseline in QTcF were also similar between groups. When analyzing QTcF prolongation based on threshold values (prolongation &gt;30msec or &gt;60 msec), between groups at all assessed timepoints, the frequencies were low and similar. ECGs were also assessed for U-waves, ST segment, T-wave, rhythm, myocardial infarction, ECG conduction and morphological abnormalites. The percentage of patients with abnormalites was generally similar between treatment groups. Based on the ECGs, 23 AEs were reported. These AEs included QT prolongation, T-wave inversion, T-wave amplitude decreased, ST segment depression, abnormal ECG, PR prolongation, and abnormal T-wave. These AEs did not demonstrate a dose response and were fairly evenly spread between treatment groups. Note that ECG assessments were also performed in the phase 3 six week treatment period crossover trials. The results were consistent with the 48-week trials.</p><p>Twenty-four hour holter monitoring was also performed in a subset of patients (N=772) in the 48-week COPD trials at days 85, 169, 281, and 337. Based on mean values, there were no dose nor time related trends with regard to heart rate, supraventricular premature beats (SVPB), or ventricular premature beats (VPB). Shift table analysis demonstrated that, in the majority of patients across treatment groups, the number of SVPBs and VPBs at baseline was similar to the last test day. There did not appear to be a consistent trend for increased SVPBs or VPBs in olodaterol groups compared to placebo. The same was true for the formoterol group. Subgroup analyses based on baseline COPD disease severity demonstrated that patients with more severe COPD (GOLD criteria), reported similar numbers/frequencies of total AEs. However, the COPD exacerbation (broad) PV was reported more frequently in GOLD IV (42.6%) patients versus GOLD III (36.4%) and GOLD II (33.8%). Overall SAEs were also more common in GOLD IV compared to GOLD II or III. This is not surprising as one would expect that those with more severe disease would be more likely to experience SAEs.</p><p>The sponsor also analyzed the safety data for the subset of patients with a history of cardiac disease (N=2360). While AEs in the cardiac disorder SOC were more common compared to the total population, the distribution between treatment groups was similar and consistent with the total population. Subgroup analysis was also performed based on presence or absence of diabetes and renal impairment. No effect was seen.</p><p>The sponsor also subgrouped based on reversibility of FEV1. Reversibility was defined as an increase in FEV1 of ≥12% or 200mL following treatment with bronchodilators (albuterol). The total number of AEs was similar between subgroups, as was the pattern of distribution in general. SAEs were higher in the non-reversible subgroup (17.2%) compared to the reversible subgroup (13.7%). This is not necessarily surprising as nonreversible patients have fixed obstruction that is not likely as responsive to LABAs. Nonreversible olodaterol 10mcg patients also had increased frequency of pneumonia PV (4.9%) compared to placebo, olodaterol 5mcg, and formoterol (3%, 3.1%, and 4%, respectively). For the reversible subgroup, a similar trend was seen for olodaterol 10mcg, though not as marked (Olo 10mcg=3%, Olo 5mcg=2.3%, placebo=2.2%, and formoterol=1.9%). Findings were similar for the pneumonia PT. The adjudicated analysis also examined safety in the same subgroups. In the time to event analysis, patients with non-reversible FEV1 in the olodaterol 10mcg group had a HR of 2.29 (95% CI 1.01, 5.21)) for the pneumonia related composite endpoint compared to placebo. However, this was not the case for the olodaterol 5mcg group. This is consistent with previously discussed pneumonia safety results where increased pneumonia and/or pneumonia-related endpoints were reported in the olodaterol 10mcg group compared to placebo, but not olodaterol 5mcg.</p></div>

FEV1 AUC (0-12 hours) and FEV1 AUC (12-24 hours) response after 6 weeks of treatment compared between olodaterol groups and formoterol. 2. FEV1 AUC (0-24 hours) response, FEV1 AUC (0-3 hours) response, peak FEV1 response and trough FEV1 response after 6 weeks of treatment 3. FVC AUC (0-24 hours) response, FVC AUC (0-3 hours) response, peak FVC response and trough FVC response after 6 weeks of treatment 4. Individual FEV1 and FVC measurements at each time points over 24 hours after 6 weeks of treatment </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trial Design</head><p>This trial was similar in design to 1222.24/25 in design. However, rather than using the active comparator formoterol, this trial used tiotropium 18mcg daily. Tiotropium and one of the double dummy placebos was administered via the Handihaler device. Long acting anticholinergics were also washed out prior to a starting trial medication. Additionally, the washout period was 21 days rather than 14 days (as in trials 1222.24/25). During each treatment period, there was also only a visit at beginning of treatment and after 6 weeks of treatment. There was no 3 week visit as in trials 1222.24/25. Also, for the 24 hour post-dose spirometry, spirometry was not performed at hour 14, otherwise time points for spirometry were the same.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer comment</head><p>It is likely that the sponsor increased the washout period compared to trials 1222.24/25 as tiotropium has a longer half life compared to formoterol. As with the previously reviewed cross-over trials, interpretation of safety data will still difficult. Removal of the 14 hour post-dose spirometric measurement leaves a 10 hour gap in the 12-24 post period, potentially making use of these curves in label problematic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results: Protocol amendments</head><p>There was a single protocol amendment (12/02/2010) which changed the definition of 'response' for primary and secondary endpoints. Note that this change made it consistent with the definition used in trials 1222.24/25.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol Violations</head><p>A total of 6 patients (5.6%) had an important protocol violation. One patient did not have appropriate washout of a short acting beta agonist. One patient received study medication for significantly longer than the planned duration. One patient had primary endpoint data recorded outside of the specified time window. One patient discontinued serevent prior to signing informed consent. Another patient discontinued tiotropium prior to signing consent, and one patient did not have pre and post PFTs performed at visit 1. neoplasm malignant, and metastases to lung). However, as with the imbalance in the infections and infestation SOC, the overall numbers for deaths related to neoplasms SOC were small [placebo=0, Olo 5mcg=2 (0.2%), Olo 10mcg=7 (0.8%)].</p><p>COPD exacerbation as a cause of death was similar across treatments. Deaths attributed to the cardiac disorder SOC were also relatively balanced between olodaterol groups and placebo, and were highest in the formoterol group. The pooled mortality data for the 48 week trials are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 148</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adjudicated Analysis-Asthmatics</head><p>As there is a known LABA safety signal in asthmatics, safety data from the asthma dose ranging trials was specifically analyzed by the adjudication committee. In the asthma safety population, there was a single respiratory-related hospitalization (pneumonia) that occurred in a patient receiving olodaterol 10mcg. One olodaterol 20mcg patient was reported to have a non-respiratory related event. There were no intubations and there were no deaths in the asthma safety population. Based on this analysis, no safety signal was evident; however, the overall exposure in the asthma population was small.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Beta2-adrenergic effects</head><p>The sponsor also analyzed AEs using multiple pharmacovigilance/SMQ endpoints which were potentially representative of beta2-adrenergic class effects. For the PVs, the grouped PTs were reasonable. The PV/SMQs with the highest frequency were the arthralgia/myalgia/muscle weakness PV and the accident and injuries SMQ. There were no clinically significant imbalances in the PV/SMQ analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bronchoconstriction</head><p>The sponsor also analyzed the data for respiratory events indicative of bronchoconstriction. These events included drops in FEV1≥15%; rescue medication use within 30 minutes of test medication inhalation during a clinic visit; and cough, wheeze or dypnea AE reported within 30 minutes of test medication inhalation during a clinic visit. Based on this analysis, olodaterol patients had a lower frequency of these events individually and in any combination. Use of olodaterol does not appear to be associated with paradoxical bronchoconstriction.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4.1">Common Adverse Events</head><p>The most common TEAEs reported in the 48-week COPD trials were within the respiratory thoracic and medistinal and infections and infestations SOC. The most common PTs were COPD exacerbation (28.3%), nasopharyngitis (9.8%), upper respiratory infection (7.5%), dyspnea (3.9%), and bronchitis (3.8%). No TEAEs based on SOC or PT demonstrated a dose response. However, several PTs were more common in both olodaterol groups compared to placebo. These included nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, back pain, and arthralgia. Of note, pneumonia </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.5">Other Safety Explorations</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.5.1">Dose Dependency for Adverse Events</head><p>For the SOC Neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified, there was suggestion of a possible dose response when analyzing death and SAEs. The neoplasms that drove this dose response were primarily lung related (see sections 7.3.1 Deaths and 7.3.2 Nonfatal Serious Adverse Events), and fell under the high level group term (HLGT) respiratory and mediastinal neoplasms malignant and unspecified. No single preferred term (PT) drove this observation. When examining all TEAEs, a similar dose response was noted, and was again driven by the same HLGT. Given the latency time for lung related neoplasms, it is unlikely that olodaterol could be directly causative of a lung related neoplasm. Additionally, the animal carcinogenicity studies did not demonstrate a lung related neoplasm signal. It should also be noted that while there was an imbalance, the frequency of events for olodaterol 5mcg was similar to/less than for formoterol. In addition the trial population, all of which have a significant smoking history, is prone to development of lung-related neoplasms, and that overall, these were not common events (&lt;1%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.5.2">Time Dependency for Adverse Events</head><p>The sponsor did not perform a specific analysis of safety data for time dependency and adverse events. However, the safety profile from the 6 week treatment period crossover trials (trial 1222.24/25/39/40/37/38) and 48 week parallel group COPD trials were generally similar. The top three most common SOCs for all AEs were the same (infections and infestations, RTM, and musculoskeletal and connective tissue). Not surprisingly, there were more deaths and SAEs in the 48 week trials compared to the 6 week treatment period crossover trials. COPD exacerbations during treatment period were also more frequent in the 48-week versus 6-week crossover trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.5.3">Drug-Demographic Interactions</head><p>The sponsor performed a variety of subgroup safety analyses based on baseline demographic information. There were no meaningful differences regarding the pattern/frequency of AEs based on sex and race. Based on age, SAEs were more frequent in the ≥65 year olds (19.4%) compared to &lt;65 years olds (13.4%), but were balanced between treatment groups. Based on region, patterns and frequencies of AEs were generally similar between U.S., European, and Asian populations. However, the PT nasopharyngitis was much more frequent in Europe (17.6%) compared to the U.S. (3.9%) and Asia (7.7%). However, the pattern between treatment groups for each region was similar to the total population. when given as a fixed dose inhaler versus when given as individual components. Neither drug significantly affected the other with regard to systemic exposure when given in combination.</p><p>In addition to drug-drug interaction studies, the sponsor performed multiple subgroup analyses based on background COPD medications. In general, for patients on baseline LAMAs, SAMA/LAMAs, ICS, LABAs, or xanthines, overall AEs were higher; however, the distribution of AEs were similar and no new safety signals were revealed. This increase in overall AEs is not surprising given that patients who were on baseline COPD maintenance medications were likely more symptomatic or had more severe disease.</p><p>The sponsor also performed subgroup analysis based on baseline LAMA use. Approximately 24% of the safety population was on a LAMA at baseline. Patients in the LAMA subgroup versus no LAMA subgroup were similar with respect to age (65.6 vs. 63.9), duration of COPD (7.7% vs. 7.2%), and pre-bronchdilator FEV1 (44.7% vs. 44%). Overall AEs were higher in the LAMA subgroup (79.2%) versus the no LAMA subgroup (70.9%). This increase was seen throughout all the SOCs and PTs, and was not driven by a single or group of PTs. This is not necessarily surprising as it is likely that patient on LAMAs at baseline were likely more symptomatic compared to patients not taking baseline LAMAs. Between treatment groups, frequencies of AEs were similar in the LAMA subgroup. In the LAMA subgroup, SAEs were most common in the olodaterol 5mcg group (22.2%) compared to placebo (16.7%), olodaterol 10mcg (17.8%), and formoterol (17.8%). The difference between the subgroups was driven by events in the infections and infestations; neoplasms, benign, malignant, and unspecified; and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders SOCs. In the no LAMA subgroup SAEs were less common in olodaterol 5mcg (14.5%) compared to placebo (17%) and olodaterol 10mcg (17%) and similar to formoterol (14.3%).</p><p>The sponsor performed a similar analysis subgrouping patients based on baseline SAMA/LAMA use. Results were largely similar to the LAMA subgroup analysis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.6.2">Human Reproduction and Pregnancy Data</head><p>No specific trials were conduct in pregnant women. There is no human data on exposure during pregnancy. In animal studies, olodaterol's the effects on fertility and It is expected that overdose with olodaterol would produce typical class effects for LABAs. This was confirmed in BI's clinical development program, in which they studied single inhaled doses up to 70mcg, multiple inhaled doses up to 30mcg, and single IV doses up to 25mcg. LABA class effects were generally noted with more frequency with increasing doses/exposure, though a dose effect was not consistently observed. In the thorough QT trial, a dose effect was also noted with QTcF prolongation. Significant prolongation was only noted at doses &gt;10mcg. Potential for withdrawal and rebound were not formally assessed. Based on the low systemic bioavailability, withdrawal and rebound are not expected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.7">Additional Submissions / Safety Issues</head><p>The sponsor submitted a 120 day update. Data from that submission did not reveal any new issues not already commented on.</p><p>This medical officer also reviewed all AE PTs of which the exposure adjusted rate ratios (olodaterol:placebo) were ≥4 when comparing olodaterol groups to placebo. If rate ratios were not calculable (ie. because of zero cases in the placebo group), PTs were reviewed if ≥4 patients from olodaterol groups reported the event. Of the selected PTs, hematuria demonstrated the highest rate ratio; however, there was no dose response. These findings are of unclear clinincal significance. There were 12 PTs whose frequency/rate ratio increased incrementally with increasing dose. These included atelectasis, acute sinusitis, colonic polyp, deep venous thrombosis, dermatis contact, lung infection, pulmonary embolus, spinal osteoarthritis, tremor, vitamin D deficiency, and increase blood CPK. Lung infection have been previously discussed in the context of respiratory pharmacovigilance endpoints (section 7.3.5 Submission Specific Primary Safety Concerns). The increase blood CPK is consistent with the previously presented lab data. It should be noted that this was reported as an AE only in the olodaterol 10mcg group. With regard to tremors, the incremental increase with increasing dosing is not surprising given the known safety profile of LABAs. With regard to the remaining PTs, given the mechanism of action, the known LABA safety profile, the small overall numbers, and multiple comparisons performed, these imbalances are of unclear clinical significance.
