<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The primary clinical reviewers recommend regular approval of NDA 203971 for the indication: "treatment of symptomatic castration resistant prostate cancer patients with bone metastases and no evidence of visceral metastatic disease." This recommendation is based on substantial evidence of clinical benefit including a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival and symptomatic skeletal events with an acceptable safety profile.</p><p>The recommended indication has been changed from the Applicant's proposed indication to more accurately reflect the patient population that was enrolled in the key randomized clinical trial which formed the basis for this submission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Risk Benefit Assessment</head><p>NDA 203971 is primarily supported by data from trial BC1-06 (ALSYMPCA); a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international phase 3 trial enrolling patients with castration resistant prostate cancer and symptomatic bone metastases. Patients with visceral metastatic disease were excluded. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) with one pre-specified interim analysis. A key secondary endpoint was time to symptomatic skeletal events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy:</head><p>At the time of the primary interim analysis, 809 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive radium-223 (Ra-223) at 50kBq/kg intravenously every 28 days for 6 injections plus best supportive care (N=541) or placebo given at the same frequency plus best supportive care (N=268). Opiate pain medications were used for cancer-related pain in 54% of patients, non-opiate pain medications in 44% and no pain medications in 2%. Patients were stratified by baseline alkaline phosphatase (ALP), current bisphosphonate use, and prior docetaxel exposure. Current bisphosphonate use was reported by 41% of patients and 58% had received prior docetaxel.</p><p>At the pre-specified interim analysis, the primary endpoint of overall survival met the O'Brien-Fleming efficacy boundary for statistical significance revealing a decrease in the risk of death in the Ra-223 arm with a hazard ratio of 0.695 (95% CI 0.552, 0.875), p=0.00185. The median overall survival was 14.0 months compared with 11.2 months for Ra-223 and placebo respectively. The result was supported by consistent findings in pre-specified OS subgroup analyses. Multiple sensitivity analyses to adjust for slight imbalances in baseline disease characteristics continued to show a benefit in favor of Ra-223. The time to symptomatic skeletal events (SSE) was also delayed in the Ra-223 arm with a hazard ratio of 0.610 (95% CI 0.461, 0.807), p=0.00046. The median time to SSE was 13.5 months compared with 8.4 months for Ra-223 and placebo respectively. The median time to first SSE when adjusting for informative censoring by including deaths as events was 8.2 months compared with 6.1 months in the Ra-223 versus placebo arm, respectively. The incidence of spinal cord compression (4% vs. 7%) and symptomatic pathologic bone fracture (5% vs. 7%) was lower in the Ra-223 arm compared to placebo, respectively. An updated analysis after enrollment of 921 patients revealed a persistent benefit for both overall survival and time to SSE favoring Ra-223. Other markers of disease activity including time to alkaline phosphatase progression and time to PSA progression were also statistically in favor of the Ra-223 arm. While limited by infrequent assessments and a high degree of missing data, patient reported outcomes data did not reveal a detriment in quality of life measures in the Ra-223 arm when compared with placebo.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety:</head><p>In the BC1-06 trial, at the time of the primary safety analysis (safety cutoff date of July 15, 2011), 600 patients had been treated with Ra-223 plus best supportive care and 301 patients had been treated with placebo plus best supportive care. The median duration of treatment was 20 weeks for Ra-223 (6 injections) and 18 weeks (5 injections) for placebo. The most common adverse reactions (ARs) (&gt;10%) in patients receiving Ra-223 were nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and, peripheral edema. The most common hematologic laboratory abnormalities (&gt; 10%) were anemia, lymphocytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Dehydration occurred in 3.3% of the patients on Ra-223 and 1.3% patients on placebo; oral intake and fluid status should be monitored carefully for patients treated with Ra-223. Since fecal excretion is the major route of elimination and influenced by intestinal transit times, bowel movement frequency should also be carefully monitored during treatment with Ra-223.</p><p>On the Ra-223 arm, 2.3% of patients experienced bone marrow failure, with two bone marrow failure deaths (0.3%), compared to no bone marrow failure in patients treated with placebo. In patients experiencing bone marrow failure, there was a small increase in deaths related to vascular hemorrhage in Ra-223-treated patients (1.2%) compared to patients treated with placebo (0.3%). A majority of the patients who experienced bone marrow failure required blood transfusions and the bone marrow suppression was ongoing at the time of death. In the randomized controlled trial, blood transfusion and erythropoietin were used to manage myelosuppression, and G-CSF was used to manage persistent or febrile neutropenia. More patients treated with Ra-223 required blood transfusions (42% vs. 39%; respectively), erythropoietin (3.2% vs. 1.7%; respectively), and G-CSF (1.5% vs. 0%; respectively) treatment.</p><p>In the randomized clinical trial, 16% of the patients in the Ra-223 group and 18% of the patients in the placebo group received cytotoxic chemotherapy after completion of study treatments. Adequate safety monitoring and laboratory testing was not performed to assess how patients treated with Ra-223 tolerate subsequent cytotoxic chemotherapy.</p><p>Due to its mechanism of action, and as seen in nonclinical toxicology data, Ra-223 may induce secondary malignancies. Epidemiology studies of short-lived, alpha-emitting, Ra-223-224 have demonstrated an increased risk of bone sarcoma and possible association with other secondary malignancies. In the randomized trial, less than 3% of the patients were followed for more than three years after initiation of study treatment. The expected latency period for secondary malignancies greatly exceeds the duration of follow up in the Ra-223 clinical trial database. The</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Review</head><p>Paul G. Kluetz -Efficacy â€¢ William Pierce -Safety NDA 203971 Radium-223 dichloride 10 overall incidence of secondary malignancies in the randomized trial was lower on the Ra-223 arm compared to placebo (0.8% vs. 1.7%; respectively). The total incidence of solid noncutaneous malignancies in the Ra-223 database is approximately 0.4%.</p><p>The administration of Ra-223 is associated with potential risks for medical staff, care givers and members of the patient's family from radiation or contamination from spills of body fluids such as feces or urine. Therefore, radiation protection precautions must be taken in accordance with national and local regulations. Following the normal working procedures for the handling of radiopharmaceuticals and use of universal precautions for patient care is expected to be sufficient given the physical properties of the Ra-223. Due to the fecal elimination pathway of Ra-223, patients should use a toilet and the toilet should be flushed several times after each use whenever possible. Clothing soiled with Ra-223 or patient fecal matter or urine should be washed promptly and separately from other clothing. In the event of spillage of Ra-223, the local radiation protection advisor should be contacted immediately to initiate the necessary measurements and required procedures to decontaminate the area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risk:Benefit Analysis:</head><p>A statistically significant and meaningful improvement in overall survival provides substantial evidence for the efficacy of Ra-223. This is supported by an improvement in the time to symptomatic skeletal events. The application contains an adequate safety database revealing relatively modest increases in hematologic, gastrointestinal, and general adverse reactions for patients treated with Ra-223. The risk for longer term safety concerns such as bone marrow failure, secondary malignancies and the ability to tolerate subsequent cytotoxic chemotherapies will be investigated further through post-marketing requirements. Based on the totality of the data presented in this submission, the reviewers conclude that the benefit:risk of Ra-223 is favorable for the population studied in trial BC1-06: Symptomatic castration resistant prostate cancer patients with bone metastases and no evidence of visceral metastatic disease.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Recommendations for Postmarket Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS)</head><p>The clinical review team did not identify substantial safety issues that would warrant a REMS. The Division of Risk Management consultation concurred with this assessment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Recommendations for Postmarket Requirements and Commitments</head><p>Postmarketing Requirements: There is concern for delayed toxicities with this radiation product including secondary malignancies, bone marrow failure, and intolerance to subsequent cytotoxic chemotherapy. A long-term follow-up study is being negotiated as a post-marketing required trial. Please see the final approval letter for details regarding the final trial size and design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Introduction and Regulatory Background</head><p>Approximately 240,000 men in the United States are predicted to be diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2013. It is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy in U.S. men and the second leading cause of death with over 28,000 deaths in 2012. 1 While most patients are diagnosed at an early localized stage, approximately 15-30% of patients will recur following curative surgical or radiation therapy and the majority of these patients will be identified by PSA rise alone. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with either surgical castration or gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs are commonly initiated to control disease in those with metastases or with non-metastatic disease at high risk (such as those with rapid PSA doubling time). Unfortunately, nearly all patients will eventually progress on ADT. When patients recur on ADT in the setting of "castrate" levels of testosterone, patients are termed "castration resistant". Ra-223 is intended for those patients with castration resistant prostate cancer with symptomatic bone metastases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Product Information</head><p>Radium-223 dichloride solution for injection is a therapeutic alpha-particle emitting radiopharmaceutical. Throughout development, the compound has also been termed, "alpharadin" and may be referred to as such in some of the Applicant tables. The abbreviated name Ra-223 will be used preferentially throughout this review.</p><p>The predominance of alpha emission seen with Ra-223 differs from available bone-targeted radioisotopes which largely utilize beta emission. Alpha emitters have a higher energy and shorter ionization path (&lt;100 Î¼m) than existing beta emitting radiopharmaceuticals. Ra-223 dichloride has a physical half-life of 11.4 days. The majority of energy emitted by the decay of Ra-223 is alpha particles with energy ranging from 5.0 to 7.5 MeV. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Tables of Currently Available Treatments for Proposed Indications</head><p>For the purposes of this discussion, systemic therapies are those which are not targeted to a specific organ and would be considered to have activity to all areas of disease within the body (with the exception of the CNS depending on blood-brain barrier permeability). Bone-targeted therapies are considered active predominately in the bone leaving lymph node and visceral metastases untreated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Systemic Therapies:</head><p>The FDA approved systemic therapies for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) are illustrated in dark blue in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> below: All five systemic therapies approved for metastatic prostate cancer in the last 10 years have been initially approved based on overall survival, a direct measure of clinical benefit. Mitoxantrone was approved in 1996 based on a composite pain endpoint, also considered a measure of direct clinical benefit. Note: GnRH analogues have been approved based on reduction in serum testosterone. Note: Abiraterone approval based on rPFS granted in the setting of a known overall survival benefit in the post-chemotherapy setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bone Targeted Therapies:</head><p>In contrast to the systemic therapies mentioned above, bone-targeted agents have their activity limited to the bone. The available bone-targeted therapies for prostate cancer are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table  3</ref> below.  Osteoclast-targeted therapies zoledronic acid (Zometa) and denosumab (Xgeva) were approved based on a delay in the time to skeletal related events. In addition, two bone-seeking radioisotopes were approved for the palliation of bone pain from metastatic disease; Strontium-89 approved in 1993 and samarium-153 approved in 1997.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strontium-89 (Metastron) Approved in 1993:</head><p>Strontium is indicated for the relief of bone pain in patients with painful skeletal metastases. Key characteristics of Strontium-89 include:</p><p>â€¢ Pure Beta emitter maximum range in tissue is approximately 8mm â€¢ Max energy is 1.46 MeV â€¢ Half life 50.5 days â€¢ Excretion 2/3 urine, 1/3 fecal (higher urine excretion in patients with lower bone disease) â€¢ Platelet Nadir between 12 and 16 weeks. (typically about 30% reduction)</p><p>Strontium was approved based on a placebo controlled trial of 126 patients. The trial demonstrated a reduction in pain score without an increase in analgesic intake and without supplemental radiotherapy at the index site of metastases. Samarium-153 approval was based on 270 patients in two randomized clinical trials of patients with prostate cancer (86%) and other cancers with radiographic evidence of bone metastases and pain. A reduction in weekly pain score was demonstrated as seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 5</ref>: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Available Therapy Summary:</head><p>In summary, the initial approvals of available therapies for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer have largely relied on improvements in either overall survival, skeletal related events or pain. All three of these endpoints can be considered direct measures of clinical benefit in a wellconducted, blinded randomized clinical trial setting. In contrast to the available bone-seeking beta-emitting radioisotopes, Strontium and Samarium, Ra-223 is the first alpha-emitting bonetargeted therapy and also the first radio-pharmaceutical to seek FDA approval based on an overall survival benefit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Availability of Proposed Active Ingredient in the United States</head><p>Ra-223 dichloride is not currently marketed in the U.S. There are several ongoing clinical trials including a large expanded access protocol 15955 <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 11)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Important Safety Issues With Consideration to Related Drugs</head><p>There are currently no therapeutic alpha-emitting radionuclides approved in the United States. The most relevant approved products are bone-targeted, beta-emitting, radioisotopes used for palliation of bone pain from metastatic disease. The most significant toxicity related to betaemitting strontium-89 and samarium-153 is bone marrow suppression. The safety profile of an alpha particle emitter (alpha particles can penetrate 10 microns of tissue) is expected to differ from these beta emitters. The administration of any radionuclide is associated with potential risks for other persons from radiation or contamination from spills of body fluids such as feces or urine. Therefore, radiation protection precautions must be taken in accordance with national and local regulations. Universal precautions are expected to adequately protect healthcare providers and caregivers since the alpha particles will not penetrate a glove.</p><p>There is no significant exposure data available for Ra-223 from other human experience. Historical toxicity findings related to a similar isotope, radium-224 (t1/2= 3.6 days), are relevant to Ra-223 (t1/2= 11.4 days) given that both radium -223 and -224 are relatively short-lived alpha-emitting radioactive particles. Based on the radium-224 experience, potentially serious or life-threatening toxicities for Ra-223 may include bone marrow failure, bone sarcoma, secondary malignancies, and osteonecrosis. Epidemiology studies also suggest the incidence of other malignancies, including solid tumors and leukemia, may be increased with short-lived alphaemitting radionuclides. The exposure levels required to induce these toxicities or to increase the risk of secondary cancers is controversial and not clearly defined.</p><p>For additional details see section 7.2.6.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Summary of Pre-submission Regulatory Activity Related to Submission</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key Minutes of 2011 pre-NDA Meeting:</head><p>Clinical:</p><p>â€¢ FDA asked for more information regarding the Quality Verification Program and underreporting of AEs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Ethics and Good Clinical Practices</head><p>It is documented in the submitted study report that the protocol and all protocol amendments were reviewed and approved by independent ethics committees (IEC) or institutional review boards (IRBs). The study was said to be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helskinki and Good Clinical Practices (GCP, ICH E6). An IEC/IRB approved informed consent document was required to be voluntarily signed by all subjects. An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) was established to review safety data at regular intervals as well as the primary efficacy variable OS at the pre-planned interim analysis. The Applicant states the IDMC members had no affiliation with the investigators or sponsor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Submission Quality and Integrity</head><p>FDA reviewers noted a longer than normal time period between the pre-NDA meeting and the submission of the NDA. When queried regarding the reason of this delay, the Applicant responded that the delay was primarily due to commercial manufacturing challenges as well as additional data cleaning including a Quality Verification Program (QVP) for the BC1-06 trial.</p><p>After careful review of submitted data, multiple information requests, clinical site inspections and discussions with the Applicant, the overall quality and integrity of the submitted data was found to be acceptable. Both raw and analysis datasets were provided for trial BC1-06 at both the interim (primary analysis) cutoff as well as the updated analysis which provided reviewers with the ability to verify analyses submitted in the clinical study report. Additional case report forms, narratives and analyses were requested and obtained throughout the review further verifying key safety and efficacy findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Compliance with Good Clinical Practices</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality Verification Program (QVP)</head><p>After a routine planned audit conducted by Bayer, Algeta up to the end of 2010, a potential under reporting of adverse events was observed. This prompted the initiation of a Quality Verification Program. The Quality Verification Program summary report (R-8744) v.1.0 dated 11/24/2012 was submitted by the Applicant. The QVP was intended to confirm the quality of data with respect to adverse events, patient eligibility and CRA access to electronic source data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Timeline:</head><p>â€¢ The predominant discrepancies were related to concomitant medications (38 patients) and medical history (32 patients). The Applicant notes that none of these findings were likely to affect eligibility, the safety of subjects or the assessment of efficacy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>QVP Conclusion:</head><p>The report concludes that there were no obvious patterns or unexpected findings in the types of adverse events under-reported. While there were some countries with higher underreporting, there were differences between sites within those countries and in general there was no regional, site or CRA pattern noted or bias of under-reporting for either treatment arm. CRO study teams were retrained and 31 sites were identified as needing further quality oversight and the QVP was extended for them into the post-interim analysis phase of data collection.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: In order to address concerns regarding the accuracy of CRFs and primary analysis datasets with respect to overall survival and skeletal related events, a Reviewer Comment: The Applicant was asked whether any of the site closures were reported to the FDA under the IND. The Applicant responded that these were not considered premature site closures, but rather enrollment holds and thus they did not feel they were required to report them. No single site enrolled more than 12 patients and all the above sites together enrolled only 6.4% of the interim analysis population..</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Database -CIOMS Discrepancies</head><p>The Applicant conducted a routine quality control medical review of the contents of the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) forms and the narratives and compared them with the patient profiles in the clinical database to evaluate for discrepancies. This was conducted by sponsor medical experts. Patients who were reviewed included deaths during treatment or within 30 days of last treatment, SAEs, or AEs leading to discontinuation. The majority of inconsistencies were with concomitant medications that were not entered into the database. Additional skeletal related events were also found via review of the adverse event datasets.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: These discrepancies were reviewed and do not appear to materially affect the efficacy or safety findings with the exception of those which would be considered skeletal related events. The additional 38 unreported skeletal related events were included in a post-hoc exploratory analysis by the Applicant with slightly improved hazard ratio favoring the Ra-223 arm. Further details regarding the additional SRE events are found in the Efficacy section of the clinical review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol Deviations:</head><p>Reference ID: 3291496</p><p>Clinical Review Paul G. Kluetz -Efficacy â€¢ William Pierce -Safety NDA 203971 Radium-223 dichloride</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>21</head><p>A total of 232 patients had protocol violations as defined by the protocol. There were 95/268 (35.4%) protocol violations in the placebo arm compared with 137/541 (25.3%) violations in the Ra-223 arm. The most common protocol violation was receiving less than 3 doses of study treatment which was required in order to be included in the per-protocol (PP) population. Protocol deviations by arm are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_19">Table 7</ref> below: Reviewer Comment: The discrepancy seen between the arms in protocol deviations is primarily due to the placebo group receiving less than 3 doses of study medication. This appears to be secondary to patients being discontinued for disease progression or death prior to receiving their 3rd placebo dose. Early deaths from both arms were noted in the IDMC minutes and it was stated that adherence to the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria, particularly with respect to performance status and life expectancy, should be reiterated to Investigators. This appears to have made a difference. Of the 314 death events in the primary analysis (10/2010 data cutoff), 19/314 (6%) occurred within 60 days of randomization (11 Radium and 8 placebo). In the subsequent 2011 analysis, of the additional 214 death events there were only 4 deaths that had occurred within 60 days of randomization (1.9%) indicating that early deaths were less common as the trial progressed. The remainder of the protocol deviations were relatively well balanced between the arms and unlikely to bias the study results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Site Inspections:</head><p>Based on efficacy and safety reporting as well as protocol deviations for each clinical site, 4 study sites were identified for clinical site inspections performed by the Office of Scientific Investigations (OSI).  In addition to clinical sites, the Applicant, Bayer, was inspected. Source verification of key efficacy endpoints were conducted including overall survival and symptomatic skeletal events. Of note, site 006, 033 and 035 were identified by the Applicant based on their risk based approach for the Quality Verification Program. Site 002 was not a part of the QVP.</p><p>The clinical and Applicant site inspections did not reveal any significant concerns at the time of this review, however final inspection report is pending.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Financial Disclosures</head><p>A financial disclosure reporting threshold of $25,000 per investigator was used. The overall financial disclosure information was reviewed. The study coordinating investigator was noted to have received a total of $60,983 collectively from Bayer and Algeta in the form of consulting and honoraria fees. The Applicant notes the following steps to minimize potential bias from this relationship:</p><p>1. The investigator enrolled only of the total study population randomized 2. The interpretation of the outcome for the primary endpoint of OS is not subject to bias 3. There were a total of 136 sites enrolling patients into the trial.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The subset of patients enrolled by the study coordinating investigator were reviewed. An analysis of the main efficacy endpoint (OS) was performed by the statistical reviewer for the patients enrolled at this site at the time of the interim analysis.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls</head><p>During the review, it was noted that the calibration of the radiation dose for Ra-223 may be a potential safety/efficacy issue. An information request was sent to the Applicant regarding the concern that given the novel alpha-emission characteristics of Ra-223, commercial U.S. radiopharmacies (outside of clinical trial conditions) may not be able to accurately measure the correct dose using standard dose calibrators. Data regarding the type of calibrators used in the clinical trial BC1-06 and their suitability to generalize to standard U.S. practice were requested. The Applicant responded with this data and in addition, applicable NIST reports on Ra-223 measurement and NIST traceable sources were submitted.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Clinical Pharmacology</head><p>Single-and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic, biodistribution and dosimetry data were obtained from 3 phase-1 studies and 3 phase-2 studies (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 10</ref>) at doses ranging from 46 to 250 kBq/kg body weight. For a full discussion of the clinical pharmacology package please see the primary FDA clinical pharmacology review. Briefly, Ra-223 is rapidly cleared from the blood with only 20% at 15 minutes, 4% at 4 hours and &lt;1% at 24 hours of post-injection activity present in the blood. Fecal excretion is the major route of elimination. There is no significant renal or hepatic clearance. There was no significant uptake in the heart, liver, kidneys urinary bladder or spleen at 4 hours. Reviewer Comment: There is a concern regarding secondary exposure to the patient and/or caregivers through radioactivity present in feces during the first several days after injection. The concern is mitigated by the very short path length of the alpha-emission based radioactivity. Additionally, given fecal elimination, constipation and decreased fecal transit as well as environmental exposure were discussed throughout the review and were considered during labeling. Analysis of adverse events for those with and without constipation was performed and did not reveal a substantial increase in adverse events. See safety results for details.</p></div>

Interestingly, the time to alkaline phosphatase progression was significantly in favor of Ra-223 in all weight quartiles. <ref type="table" target="#tab_24">(Table 9</ref>) PSA progression was defined as: i. in subjects with no PSA decline from baseline as: 25% increase from the baseline value and an increase in absolute value of â‰¥ 2 ng/mL, at least 12 weeks from baseline â‰¥ ii. in subjects with an initial PSA decline from baseline as: 25% increase and an absolute increase of â‰¥ 2 ng/mL above the nadir value, which was confirmed by a second value obtained â‰¥ 3 weeks later â‰¥ b p-value is from a log-rank test stratified by total ALP, current use of bisphosphonates, and prior used of docetaxel. c Hazard ratio is from a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for total ALP, current use of bisphosphonates, and prior used of docetaxel.

Note: Subjects who did not experience an event were censored at the last disease assessment date. Note: Cut-off date July 15, 2011. Note: Dataset used in this analysis: <ref type="bibr">[PSAALP]</ref> It is also notable that the BC1-04 dose-finding study revealed a higher confirmed PSA response at the higher 80 kBq/kg dose level. Reviewer Comment: Based on the analysis of overall survival by weight quartile, as well as PSA response results from the dose finding study BC1-04, the dosing strategy for Ra-223 may not be optimal. A post-marketing commitment is being drafted in order to optimize dosing of Ra-223.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.1">Mechanism of Action</head><p>Ra-223 is an alpha-emitting radionucleotide. The divalent cation Ra-223 is the active moiety and is selectively taken up in areas of increased bone turnover (such as bone metastases) where it forms a complex with hydroxyapatite. Ra-223 is unique compared with other available therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals in that 95.3% of its total energy emitted is via alpha-particles (helium nuclei). Alpha emitters have higher radiation transfer than beta emitters and induce double-strand DNA breaks which sets Ra-223 apart from existing radiopharmaceuticals. ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure  3</ref>) Alpha particles also have a very short track length providing dense ionizing radiation in a narrow range with the theoretical benefit of less toxicity to adjacent healthy bone marrow. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.2">Pharmacodynamics</head><p>Clinical trial BC1-04 assessed a total of 122 patients randomized to three doses of Ra-223: 25-, 50-, and 80 kBq/kg. There was a significant dose response noted with 0%, 5.6% and 12.8% of patients demonstrating a confirmed 50% PSA decline for the 25-, 50-and 80 kBq/kg doses respectively. In the phase 3 trial, BC1-06, patients with higher actual body weight (i.e., higher total dose) appear to exhibit better OS improvement while experiencing no substantial increase in the incidence of Grade 3 or worse (Grade 3+) adverse events (AEs). The dose -response relationship for efficacy (e.g., OS improvement) is even more clear, when ideal body weight (IBW) normalized dose [(actual body weight * 50 kBq/kg)/ideal body weight] is used as the variable for dose. The OS benefit seems to be limited in patients whose actual body weight is less than their ideal body weight. A case has been made by the FDA clinical pharmacology review team that a dose higher than 50 kBq/kg should be further evaluated and the clinical reviewers agree with this recommendation. See the FDA clinical pharmacology review for details on the pharmacodynamics of Ra-223. </p></div>

Both studies were limited by small sample size. Pain was recorded using brief pain index and WHO analgesic scores (0-none, 1-non-opiates, 2-weak opiates, 3-strong opiates) during both studies. The interpretation of pain results and higher PSA responses seen in BC1-02 are complicated by the administration of EBRT at the start of the study on both arms. The pain results seen in these two trials were limited by missing data and small sample sizes</p><p>The BC1-04 trial revealed dose dependent improvements in confirmed 50% PSA declines and there did not appear to be an increase in toxicity between the 50 and 80-kBq/kg cohorts.

While an end of phase 2 meeting offered advice for the design of the trial, there was no special protocol assessment agreement in place. The original protocol was submitted 12/2007 and it was amended 6 times <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 12</ref>).   Reviewer Comment: It was noted by the review team that, given there are no scheduled radiographic assessments, skeletal events were most likely to be triggered by symptoms. This is in contrast to prior definitions of SRE composite endpoints for osteoclast-targeted agents which utilized scheduled radiographic assessments and thus likely had more events which were asymptomatic but found on routine radiographic exams. The review team feels the SRE definition in BC1-06 is a more symptom-driven endpoint and more consistent with direct clinical benefit. In order to highlight this difference, the reviewers have renamed the key secondary endpoint time to skeletal related event (SRE) to "time to symptomatic skeletal event (SSE).

An FDA analysis removing the age &lt;55 subgroup from the ITT population did not materially affect the OS or SRE primary analysis. The pre-specified stratification factors were well-balanced with approximately 41% of patients reporting current use of bisphosphonates, 58% prior docetaxel and 44% had baseline alkaline phosphatase â‰¥220 U/L.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 15</ref> below. There were more cases of metastatic prostate cancer at initial diagnosis in the placebo arm (36% vs. 26%). Also of note, more patients in the placebo arm were recorded as having had a high-grade Gleason score of 8-10 (49% vs. 41%). The discrepancy in patients diagnosed with metastatic disease (M1) was reflected by a higher number of patients with M0 disease receiving local therapy with prostatectomy or radiation in the Ra-223 arm <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 16</ref>).

As such, the significant improvement in time to SSE in this application is an important key secondary endpoint to support the overall survival finding.</p><p>As was mentioned previously, the SSE data for BC1-06 was updated with an additional 38 SSE events with the subsequent sensitivity analysis continuing to favor Ra-223 with a hazard ratio for time to first SSE of 0.60. The majority of SSE events were EBRT, however the analysis of other important individual SSE events such as time to spinal cord compression and time to pathologic fracture were also in favor of the Ra-223 arm. It is the reviewer's determination that the delay in time to first SSE is statistically persuasive and clinically meaningful in its support for the overall survival findings and should be included in the FDA label. It is also recommended that the endpoint name be changed to time to symptomatic skeletal event [from proposed time to skeletal related event (SRE)] to more accurately reflect the way in which the composite endpoint was collected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual Components of the SSE Composite Endpoint</head><p>The majority of events were external beam radiotherapy to painful bone metastases, however events that did not require investigator decision such as spinal cord compression (6.0% vs. 3.3%) and symptomatic pathologic bone fracture (6.7% vs. 3.8%) were more common in the placebo arm compared with Ra-223 respectively. The incidence of individual events was increased  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSA Response (confirmed 50% PSA decline)</head><p>The proportion of patients experiencing a confirmed 50% decline in PSA compared to baseline was 6% in the Ra-223 arm compared with 1% in placebo in trial BC1-06. This PSA response rate is consistent with the confirmed response rate seen in study BC1-04 of 5.6% in the 50 kBq/kg arm. PSA has limitations as an indicator of antitumor activity in prostate cancer; however other cytotoxic agents 3 and androgen receptor-directed therapies 4 in both the chemotherapy-naive and chemotherapy-refractory setting have shown substantially higher PSA declines. A literature search of other approved radioisotopes such as strontium and samarium reveals that low PSA response (defined as PSA decline &gt;50%) may be a class effect for bone-seeking radioisotope monotherapies, and has been reported in the 7%-9% range .5,6 Whether this marginal PSA response is due to non-bone foci of prostate cancer being left untreated, incomplete cytotoxicity by radioisotopes, an effect of concomitant therapies diluting the response or other unknown effects is not known. It is notable that in BC1-04, there was a PSA dose response relationship seen with a confirmed PSA response of 0%, 5.6% and 12.8% seen at doses of 25, 50 and 80 kBq/kg respectively. This doubling of PSA response may add additional support to the idea that the optimal dose of Ra-223 has not been reached.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSA Declines by Extent of Bone Disease</head><p>An additional exploratory analysis of PSA response by extent of bone metastases was performed for the Ra-223 arm.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Review</head><p>Paul G. Kluetz -Efficacy â€¢ William Pierce -Safety NDA 203971 Radium-223 dichloride Reviewer Comment: The achievement of an overall survival benefit in the absence of a strong PSA response is unique to this application when compared to prior cytotoxic and androgen receptor based prostate cancer therapies approved with an overall survival benefit. PSA may be a poor surrogate for the prediction of direct measures of clinical benefit both for this application and for prior applications of bone-targeted radioisotopes for the palliation of pain due to bone metastases in prostate cancer. It appears that one can achieve a meaningful reduction of pain (strontium, samarium) and now an improvement in overall survival despite low PSA response results. The lack of effect on disease outside of the bone is likely a significant contributor to this disconnect although there may be other confounding factors.</p><p>In conclusion, the FDA review of secondary endpoints confirmed that all 5 secondary endpoints met statistical significance and provides internal consistency to the overall survival results. While time to first SSE was them most relevant endpoint and was felt to show a benefit favoring Ra-223, the magnitude of that benefit is uncertain. The small magnitude of PSA response seen in this application appears to be consistent with PSA data from other radio-isotopes granted approval for pain reduction, and it is the reviewer's determination that the PSA data do not alter the positive risk:benefit assessment of this application based on significant improvements in direct clinical benefit measures of overall survival and delay in symptomatic skeletal events.</p></div>

See <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 35</ref> below. Reviewer Comment: The assessment of anti-tumor activity for Ra-223 is problematic. Bone scan data is lacking to perform a PFS analysis. PSA response is limited by use of concomitant medications with known anti-cancer activity and continued production of PSA by prostate cancer continuing to grown outside of Ra-223 treated bone lesions. Nonetheless, while of moderate magnitude, PSA and bone scan findings appear to be trending in the direction of antitumor activity and it is the reviewer's determination that the strength of both overall survival and time to SSE results are enough to provide substantial evidence of direct clinical benefit.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Review of Safety</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Summary</head><p>In this NDA, the Applicant submitted safety data from 904 patients treated with Ra-223 and 332 patients treated with placebo in the BC1-06 randomized controlled trial or in one of six other Phase 1 or 2 clinical trials. Nearly all (n=894) of these patients had castration-resistant prostate cancer. At the proposed dose of 50 kBq/kg actual body weight (BW), 703 patients were treated with Ra-223. In the BC1-06 trial (a.k.a., ALSYMPCA), patients were scheduled to receive six injections once every 28 days; 600 patients received 50 kBq/kg BW of Ra-223 and 301 patients received placebo. The median number of injections on the Ra-223 arm was six with a median duration of treatment of 20 weeks compared to 5 injections and a median duration of treatment of 18 weeks on the placebo arm. The number of patients and duration of exposure to Ra-223 was adequate for this NDA safety review.</p><p>Key findings from the BC1-06 randomized controlled trial: â€¢ Deaths due to Adverse Events (AEs): Deaths due to AEs were less common on the Ra-223 arm compared to the placebo arm (19% vs. 28%; respectively). The most common AEs with an outcome of death were related to progression of disease on both arms (10% vs. 12%; respectively). For Ra-223-treated patients compared to placebo, there was a small increase in deaths related to bone marrow failure (0.3% vs. 0.0%; respectively); and in patients with bone marrow failure, deaths related to vascular hemorrhage (1.2% vs. 0.3%; respectively).</p><p>â€¢ Nonfatal Serious Adverse Events (SAEs): The overall incidence of nonfatal SAEs was lower on the Ra-223 arm compared to placebo (44% vs. 57%; respectively). There was a small increase in nonfatal SAEs for thrombocytopenia (2.3% vs. 1.0%; respectively), dehydration (2.0 vs. 1.0%; respectively), and renal failure and impairment (1.8% vs. 0.7%; respectively) for Ra-223-treated patients compared to placebo. A majority of the renal failure and impairment SAEs on the Ra-223 arm were due to urinary tract obstruction likely related to prostate cancer; with exclusion of these SAEs a small increase remained (0.8% vs. 0.0%) and these SAEs were likely related to dehydration and negative fluid status.</p><p>â€¢ Discontinuations due to AEs: Discontinuations due to AEs were less common on the Ra-223 arm compared to placebo (16% vs. 19%; respectively). There was an increase in discontinuations due to bone marrow suppression on the Ra-223 arm compared to placebo (5.3% vs. 2.7%; respectively) and discontinuation due to metastases to non-skeletal sites (1.2% vs. 0.0%); the latter is important in that Ra-223 is not thought to be effective in treating visceral prostate cancer.</p><p>â€¢ Grade 3 and 4 AEs: Overall there were fewer Grade 3 -4 AEs on the Ra-223 arm (59%) compared to the placebo arm (65%). The largest increases in Grade 3 -4 AEs on the Ra-223 arm compared to placebo were thrombocytopenia (6.5% vs. 2.0%; respectively), neutropenia (2.0% vs. 0.3%; respectively), leukopenia (1.7% vs. 0.3%; respectively), and pancytopenia (1.2% vs. 0.0%; respectively).</p><p>â€¢ Common Adverse Reactions (ARs) and Laboratory Abnormalities: The most common adverse drug reactions (&gt;10%) in patients receiving Ra-223 were nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and, peripheral edema. The most common hematologic laboratory abnormalities (&gt; 10%) were anemia, lymphocytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia.</p><p>â€¢ Bone Marrow Failure and Pancytopenia: In the randomized trial, 2.3% of the patients on the Ra-223 arm experienced bone marrow failure or pancytopenia compared to no patients treated with placebo. A majority of the patients who experienced bone marrow failure required blood transfusions and the bone marrow suppression was ongoing at the time of death. On the Ra-223 arm, 5.3% of the patients permanently discontinued therapy due to â€¢ Vascular Hemorrhage: Despite a small increase in deaths due to vascular hemorrhage on the Ra-223 arm, there were no increases in total, minor, or major hemorrhagic SAEs. When comparing the Ra-223 arm to the placebo arm, there was a small increase in Grade 1-4 gastrointestinal hemorrhage (2.0% vs. 1.3%; respectively) and hematoma (0.5% vs. 0.0%; respectively) (MedDRA HLGT terms). Most of these AEs are Grade 1 or 2; there was a small increase in Grade 3 gastrointestinal hemorrhages (0.7% vs. 0.0%, respectfully); only two of these cases were reported with temporally associated thrombocytopenia ARs. Patient #209-003 had Grade 4 thrombocytopenia and a Grade 1 rectal hemorrhage. Patient #111-024 had a Grade 1 thrombocytopenia and subcutaneous hematoma.</p><p>â€¢ Blood Transfusions, Erythropoietin, and G-CSF: Ra-223-treated patients were treated with more of the following compared to patients treated with placebo: blood transfusions (42% vs. 39%; respectively), erythropoietin (3.2% vs. 1.7%; respectively), and G-CSF (1.5% vs. 0%; respectively). A majority of the patients who experienced Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenic ARs were managed with transfusions (18 out of 39 patients).</p><p>â€¢ Risk of Secondary Malignancies: Epidemiology studies of short-lived, alpha-emitting, radium-224 have demonstrated an increased risk of bone sarcoma and possible association with other secondary malignancies and hereditary defects. Due to its mechanism of action and nonclinical toxicology data, Ra-223 has the potential to induce secondary malignancies.</p><p>In the randomized trial, less than 3% of the patients were followed for more than 3 years after initiation of study treatment. The expected latency period for bone sarcomas and other secondary malignancies greatly exceeds the duration of follow up collected in Ra-223 clinical trials. The overall incidence of secondary malignancies in the randomized trial was lower on the Ra-223 arm compared to placebo (0.8% vs. 1.7%; respectively). A majority of the secondary malignancies reported were non-serious non-melanoma skin carcinomas (0.7% vs. 1.0%). The total incidence of solid non-cutaneous malignancies in the Ra-223 database is approximately 0.4%. A Postmarketing Requirement (PMR) for longer term monitoring of a larger patient population treated with Ra-223 is recommended.</p><p>â€¢ Subsequent Treatment with Cytotoxic Chemotherapy: In the randomized clinical trial, 16% of the patients in the Ra-223 group and 18% of the patients in the placebo group received cytotoxic chemotherapy after completion of study treatments. The median time to initiation of chemotherapy (80 days vs. 65 days; respectively) and the duration of the chemotherapy (120 days vs. 113 days; respectively) were comparable for patients treated with Ra-223 and placebo. Adequate safety monitoring and laboratory testing was not performed to assess how patients treated with Ra-223 will tolerate subsequent cytotoxic chemotherapy.</p><p>â€¢ Bowel Movement Monitoring: Fecal excretion is the major route of elimination from the body for Ra-223. The rate of elimination from the gastrointestinal tract was influenced by â€¢ Radionuclide Precautions: Patients, providers, and caregivers require precautions to minimize the risk of radioactive contamination and exposure. Given the short path-length of alpha particles, the normal working procedures for radiopharmaceutical handling and universal precautions for healthcare workers (i.e., gloves and barrier gowns) are expected to adequately prevent significant secondary exposure to Ra-223.</p></div>

The BC1-02 study was a small (n=64), randomized (1:1), placebo-controlled trial. The BC1-03 and BC1-04 studies are both Ra-223 dose response trials. A brief description of the clinical trial designs and the safety cutoff dates for each trial (original NDA submission) are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table  10</ref>. In these trials, a total of 904 patients were treated with Ra-223 and 332 patients were treated with placebo. Ra-223 was administered to 894 prostate and 10 breast cancer patients, all with bone metastases. The prostate cancer patients enrolled in these trials had castration-resistant disease (CRPC), or were taking hormone therapy, or had undergone orchiectomy, with the exception of two patients (Patient #3205 and #7317) in the AT1-BC-1 trial. 2011 safety cutoff date). Nearly all of the AE terms reviewed were accurately recorded and coded in the AESAF dataset and no significant discrepancies were identified. For each CRF reviewed, CRA monitoring and use of multiple study Investigator data queries resolved data discrepancies and obtained missing data. The few minor discrepancies that were identified in this comparison were not significant with regards to the overall integrity of the AE database.</p></div>

As scheduled in the BC1-06 trial, measurement of hematologic laboratory parameters 28 days after drug administration may under report hematologic AEs in terms of incidence and severity. Lack of laboratory data (scheduled and unscheduled) during the timeframe in which the nadir for these hematologic toxicities occur complicates interpretation of hematologic toxicities. Conversely, the hematologic AEs reported for patients treated at 50 kBq/kg in the Phase 1 and 2 trials were reported at a lower incidence and severity than in patients treated in the BC1-06 trial. Future trials of Ra-223 should include hematologic laboratory monitoring more frequently and include more complete unscheduled laboratory values in the datasets to assess the incidence, impact, and severity of these toxicities with more precision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.5">Metabolic, Clearance, and Interaction Workup</head><p>The pharmacokinetics of Ra-223 in blood was linear in terms of dose proportionality and time independence in the dose ranges investigated [46 to 250 kBq (1.24 to 6.76 microcurie) per kg body weight]. After intravenous injection, Ra-223 is rapidly cleared from the blood and is distributed primarily into bone or excreted into the intestine. Fifteen minutes after injection, approximately 20% of the injected radioactivity remained in the blood. After four hours, approximately 4% of the injected radioactivity remained in blood, with a decrease to less than 1% approximately 24 hours after the Ra-223 administration. At ten minutes post injection, radioactivity was detected in bone and the intestine. At 4 hours post-injection, the percentage of the radioactivity present in bone and intestine was approximately 61% and 49%, respectively. No significant uptake was seen in other organs such as heart, liver, kidneys, urinary bladder, and spleen four hours after injection. Ra-223 is an isotope which decays and is not metabolized. The whole body measurements indicated that approximately 63% of the administered radioactivity was excreted from the body within 7 days after injection (after correcting for decay). Fecal excretion is the major route of elimination from the body. At 48 hours after injection, the cumulative fecal excretion was 13% (range 0-34%), and the cumulative urine excretion was 2% Clinical Review Paul G. Kluetz -Efficacy â€¢ William Pierce -Safety NDA 203971 Radium-223 dichloride 84 (range 1-5%). There was no evidence of hepato-biliary excretion based on imaging data. The rate of elimination of Ra-223 dichloride from the gastrointestinal tract is influenced by the high variability in intestinal transit rates across the population. Hepatic impairment is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of Ra-223 dichloride. Since excretion in urine is minimal, and the major route of elimination is via the feces, renal impairment is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of Ra-223 dichloride.</p><p>See the FDA primary Clinical Pharmacology review for more information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.6">Evaluation for Potential Adverse Events for Similar Drugs in Drug Class</head><p>There are currently no therapeutic alpha-emitting radionuclides approved in the United States. As discussed in Section 2 of this review, for Ra-223, the most relevant approved products are bone-targeted, beta-emitting, radioisotopes used for palliation of bone pain from metastatic disease. There are limitations when comparing Ra-223 to these beta emitting radionuclides due to the differences in alpha-vs. beta emission, radioactive decay half-lives, and the primary clearance pathways for these products (renal) compared to Ra-223 (fecal). Strontium-89 [beta emission (max. energy= 1.46 MeV); max. range= 8 mm in tissue; rad. t1/2= 50.5 days] and samarium-153 [beta emission (max. energy= 0.23 MeV); max. range= 3.0 mm in tissue and 1.7 mm in bone; rad. t1/2= 46.3 days] are both rapidly cleared from the blood and have an affinity for bone with concentration in areas of bone turnover. Approximately 2/3 of the unbound strontium-89 is excreted in the urine, with the highest excretion rate in the first two days following injection. The remaining 1/3 of unbound strontium-89 is excreted fecally. Unbound samarium-153 is eliminated in the urine with approximately 35% (+15%) excreted within six hours after intravenous injection. <ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">9</ref> The most significant toxicity related to strontium-89 and samarium-153 is bone marrow suppression. For strontium-89, the incidence of Grade 3 decreases in hemoglobin, leukocyte, and platelet count increased approximately 4 -8% compared to placebo. There was a slight increase in the incidence of Grade 4 hemoglobin (2% vs. 1%, respectively) and platelet count decrease (1% vs. 0%, respectively). For samarium-153, the most common ARs were thrombocytopenia (69.3% vs. 8.9%, respectively), leukopenia (59.3% vs. 6.7%, respectively), hemoglobin decreased (40.7% vs. 23.3%, respectively), and infection (17.1% vs. 11.1%, respectively). For strontium-89, the bone marrow toxicities are primarily related to platelet and white blood cell counts, result in an approximate 30% reduction in platelet counts, and usually occur 12 -16 weeks after administration, with recovery within six months after treatment in the absence of disease progression or additional therapies. For samarium-153, white blood cell and platelet counts decreased to a nadir of approximately 40% to 50% approximately 3 -5 weeks after administration and returned to the pre-treatment levels in approximately 8 weeks. Other toxicities related to strontium-89 and/or samarium-153 include the potential for fetal harm, risks for nursing and excretion in human milk, "calcium-like flushing sensations" related to rapid Clinical Review Paul G. Kluetz -Efficacy â€¢ William Pierce -Safety NDA 203971 Radium-223 dichloride 85 injections (strontium-89 only), urinary catheterization for incontinent patients, precautions for patients with renal dysfunction, and requirements for appropriate radiopharmaceutical and waste handling, administration, and controls. Use in patients with evidence of seriously compromised bone marrow from previous therapy or disease infiltration, or with concomitant chemotherapy or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is not recommended. <ref type="bibr">9,</ref><ref type="bibr">10</ref> There is no significant exposure data available for Ra-223 from other human experience unrelated to this Ra-223 dichloride developmental program. Historical toxicity findings related to radium-224 (t1/2= 3.6 days) are relevant to Ra-223 (t1/2= 11.4 days) because both radium -223 and -224 are short-lived alpha-emitting radioisotopes. <ref type="bibr">10,</ref><ref type="bibr">11</ref> The shared mechanisms of action are both due to the high linear energy transfer associated with alpha particle emission. Internal exposure from radium-224 is available from use as an injectable therapy to treat ankylosing spondylitis (spinal arthritis) and bone tuberculosis. Based on the radium-224 experience, potentially serious or life-threatening toxicities for Ra-223 include bone marrow failure, bone sarcoma, secondary malignancies, and osteonecrosis. Historical data from radium-224 exposure establishes a clear association with bone sarcoma and bone marrow failure. The bone sarcomas were usually osteosarcomas, with chondrosarcoma and fibrosarcoma rarely reported. These bone sarcomas presented in the radial skeleton, long bones, and in major joints. Based on additional long term epidemiology studies, the incidence of other malignancies, including solid tumors and leukemia, may also be increased with short-lived alpha-emitting radionuclides. In the "Speiss" study, 900 German patients were treated with relatively high doses of radium-224 over approximately 10 weeks [mean skeletal dose= 2.08 Gy (SD=1.5)] between 1945 and 1955. These patients were followed until as recently as December of 2007. Fifty-seven bone sarcomas were reported in 56 patients compared to an estimated expected number of 0.2 for this study. Bone sarcoma incidence peaked approximately eight years (range: 4 -33 years) after initial radium-224 exposure. These patients were compared to the German Saarland Cancer Registry to calculate Standardized Incidence Ratios (SIRs) for other secondary cancers. Excluding cancers occurring within five years of initial exposure (latency period) and non-melanoma skin cancers, 231 non-skeletal solid tumors were reported compared to 151 expected cases (p= &lt; 0.001). The authors concluded that there were significant increases in secondary cancer of the breast [SIR not receive radioactive treatment. The authors of this study reported a statistically significant (p&lt; 0.001) increase in the incidence of leukemia (primarily myeloid) in patients treated with lower exposure levels of radium-224. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> An additional case control study performed by Wick et. al. evaluated lower doses of radium-224 (mean skeletal dose= 0.56 Gy) in ankylosing spondylitis patients and identified 11 bone marrow failures (0.7%; 11/1501) on the radium-224 arm compared to 4 bone marrow in control patients (0.3%; 4/1556). <ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">16</ref> In the "Spiess" study, tooth breakage was reported in 12% of the pediatric patients and in 2% of the adults treated with radium-224. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> The mechanism of action for bone necrosis and osteomyelitis related to radium may be related to a disruption of blood flow in Haversian systems due to "mineral plugs" and destruction of small blood vessels in the bone. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> The exposure level required to induce these toxicities or to increase the risk of secondary cancers is controversial and not clearly defined. There appears to be a dose response relationship related to secondary malignancies with an increase in the incidence of secondary cancers at higher doses, but it is unclear if the dose response curve is linear, if linear extrapolation underestimates the risk at low doses, or if there is a specific threshold of exposure in which these risks significantly increase or become impractical in relation to the human lifespan. Although there is a lack of unequivocal evidence, radium is assumed to be carcinogenic even at the lowest dose levels. <ref type="bibr">10,</ref><ref type="bibr">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">14</ref> Reviewer Comment: In addition to typical concerns related to cross study comparisons, the ability to compare radium exposure levels across these studies is significantly limited by differences in the dosimetry, dose estimations, and exposure calculations used for the referenced studies.</p></div>

In the table above this death is reported as thrombocytopenia, but the case is discussed among the lower respiratory infections below. â€¢ Patient #146-004 was a death attributed to multiple organ failure by the Applicant, but the case narrative noted depression of the bone marrow. FDA notes he experienced hemorrhagic complications with high grade thrombocytopenia, platelet transfusions, and bleeding at the time of death. This death is considered in the FDA vascular hemorrhage analyses and in the analyses of bone marrow suppression and multi-organ failure. â€¢ Patient #004-001 was reported as a death due to renal failure by the Applicant. However, the Investigator attributed the death to bleeding and hypovolemia in the setting of Grade 4 pancytopenia. This death is considered in the FDA vascular hemorrhage analyses. â€¢ Patient #037-012 was reported as a death due to a fatal extradural hematoma associated with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia that required multiple whole blood transfusions before the event, so this death is significantly confounded, but the contribution of Ra-223 cannot be ruled out, and this death was considered related to vascular hemorrhage.</p><p>The following sections include brief summaries of the AEs of interest with an outcome of death that occurred on the Ra-223 arm of the BC1-06 trial.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vascular Hemorrhagic Deaths</head><p>Deaths related to hemorrhage or with potential hemorrhagic complications were grouped together as vascular hemorrhagic disorders (MedDRA HLGT term) and compared across the BC1-06 study arms. There was a small increase (1.0% vs. 0.3%) in deaths related to vascular hemorrhage for patients treated with Ra-223 (Patient #002-013, #004-001, #037-012, #170-002, #146-004, #173-008) compared to patients treated with placebo. Investigator attribution for four of these deaths was possible (Patient #002-013; #004-001; #173-008; #146-004). On the Ra-223 arm, all of the patients experiencing vascular hemorrhage-related deaths had thrombocytopenia with platelet nadirs of &lt; 100 X 10 9 / L. Interpretation of the magnitude of the platelet nadirs is complicated by administration of multiple blood transfusions and limited laboratory test results for unscheduled analyses in the Applicant data provided. In addition to other methods to stop the hemorrhagic events, all of these patients required blood transfusions. An additional patient (#034-004) treated with Ra-223 who experienced treatment-emergent Grade 4 thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic complications approximately 77 days after his last dose of Ra-223 was not included in the FDA fatal vascular hemorrhagic due to significant confounding factors related to the hemorrhagic event. See the narratives for deaths due to bone marrow suppression for more information on this death. In the 90-Day safety update, one additional death due to rectal hemorrhage occurred in Patient #9-050-018, who had crossed over from the placebo arm to the Ra-223 arm. Thirty-six days after his fifth dose of Ra-223 he developed a new Grade 4 rectal bleeding, thrombocytopenia (21 X 10 9/ /L), and anemia (Hgb= 9.9 g/dL) AEs. He died three days later (39 days after last Ra-223 dose). The rectal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and anemia were ongoing at the time of his death. Investigator attribution for the AEs was possibly related to Ra-223 with his death attributed to prostate cancer progression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bone Marrow Suppression and Multiple Organ Failure Deaths</head><p>Deaths on the Ra-223 arm that were attributed to bone marrow or multiple organ failure are summarized below:</p><p>Multi-organ Failure: Patient #146-004 was a 77-year old man with CRPC (TNM unknown; EOD= &gt; 20 lesions; Total Gleason = 9) who received one dose of Ra-223 and experienced Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelet level not provided), multiple hemorrhages, and "bone marrow destruction" 11 days after treatment that progressed into fatal multiple organ failure five days later (16 days after treatment). His previous treatments included docetaxel with no prior radiotherapy to the bone or prostate. The docetaxel treatment was discontinued approximately 60 days prior to Ra-223 therapy initiation. After the onset of these events, he received 24 units of red blood cells, 6 units of platelets, fibrinogen, and transexemic acid for anemia, thrombocytopenia, and bleeding. Approximately two weeks before Ra-223 treatment, his platelet count was 144 X 10 9 /L and his hemoglobin was 11.6 g/dL. On Day 0, his pre-treatment platelet count was 75 X 10 9/ /L and hemoglobin was 11.3 g/dL. At the onset of the hemorrhagic event 11 days later, his platelet count was 49 X 10 9 /L and hemoglobin 9.9 g/dL. Throughout the hemorrhagic event, white blood cell and neutrophil counts remained at or near the normal range. The Investigator attributed the death to depression of the bone marrow most likely caused by the previous chemotherapy (docetaxel). Given the temporal association to the nadir of Ra-223, and the known risks of thrombocytopenia, this death is possibly related to Ra-223 because the contribution of Ra-223 cannot be adequately ruled out. However, it is important to note that thrombocytopenia occurred prior to the 1 st dose of Ra-223. This death also includes hemorrhagic complications and is considered in the vascular hemorrhagic death analyses. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lower Respiratory Tract and Lung Infection Deaths</head><p>When comparing Ra-223-treated patients to patients who received placebo, there was a small increase in deaths due to lower respiratory tract and lung infections (1.7% vs. 1.3%; respectively); but no increase in infection-or sepsis-related deaths overall. If patient 011-006 is included in this group, 11 deaths (1.8%) due to lower respiratory infection occurred in the Ra-223 arm. For the 11 deaths on the Ra-223 arm, the median time from the last dose of Ra-223 was 57 days (range: 20-356 days), with six of these deaths occurring within 60 days after receiving Ra-223 therapy. Pneumonia: Patient #233-005 was a 78-year old man with CRPC (unknown TNM; EOD= 6-20 lesions; Gleason=7) who received six injections of Ra-223. His previous treatments for prostate cancer included external EBRT to bone (8 Gy) and bicalutamide; no prior cytotoxic chemotherapy was administered. Twenty-one days after his last injection of Ra-223, he was admitted to the hospital with Grade 3 dehydration, Grade 1 thrombocytopenia (80 X 10 9 /L), Grade 2 anemia (Hgb= 9.4 g/dL), and Grade 2 neutropenia (ANC= 1100). The patient was treated and discharged but these AEs persisted and progressed. Forty days after the last dose of Ra-223 was administered, the patient was readmitted to the hospital with Grade 3 dehydration, Grade 2 thrombocytopenia (61 X 10 9 /L), Grade 3 anemia (Hgb= 7.2 g/dL), and Grade 3 neutropenia (ANC= 670). He was treated with intravenous antibiotics and died the same day. His chest X-ray on admission was consistent with bronchopneumonia; an autopsy was not performed. The Investigator attribution for this death was to prostate cancer due to skeletal metastases that was unrelated to study therapy. The patient's PSA supports this conclusion, with a baseline value of 78 ng/mL that increased to 790 ng/mL at the time of his last injection of Ra-223, and then to 860 ng/mL three weeks before his death.</p><p>Pneumonia: Patient #011-006 was a 68-year old man with CRPC (T3, N1, M1; EOD= 6-20 lesions; Total Gleason=7) who received six injections of Ra-223. His previous treatments consisted of orchiectomy, EBRT to the bone (30 Gy), and cyproterone. No clinically relevant neutrophil count reductions occurred while he was receiving Ra-223 treatment. His baseline (week 0) platelet count and hemoglobin were 199 X 10 9/ /L and 11.1 g/dL; respectively. His Week 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 platelet counts were 205, 180, 153, 117, and 113 X 10 9 /L; respectively. Platelet counts drawn 56 and 112 days after completion of Ra-223 therapy were 74 and 80 X 10 9/ /L; respectively. He received additional EBRT to the bone (20Gy) approximately 120 days after his last dose of Ra-223. Approximately 180 days after his last dose, he received three red blood cell transfusions (2 units each). Approximately 225 days after his last dose of Ra-223, his platelet count was 33 X 10 9 /L. Approximately 255 days after his sixth injection his platelet count was 15 X 10 9 /L. The subject's status worsened and he died 256 days after his last dose of Ra-223. The Investigator reported that the death was not caused by prostate cancer and possibly related to Ra-223 "due to the profound and long-standing thrombocytopenia". The Applicant confirmed the death was due to pneumonia and that no hemorrhage had occurred. Disease progression with bone marrow infiltration is a potential confounding factor due to an increase in PSA prior to the death. PSA was 35 ng/mL at baseline, 35 ng/mL at Week 24, and 54 ng/mL 90 days after discontinuation of Ra-223. Approximately 30 days prior to his death, his PSA had risen to 149 ng/mL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-Hemorrhagic Gastrointestinal Disorder Deaths</head><p>There was only one AE with an outcome of death (Patient #035-027) for the gastrointestinal system-organ class. Patient #035-027 was a 68-year old man treated with two doses of Ra-223 who experienced abdominal distention and fatal bowel obstruction approximately 25 days after his last dose of Ra-223. His medical history was significant for CRPC (Total Gleason = 9; T3 disease) with skeletal metastases (&gt;20 lesions), sigmoid diverticular disease, non-insulin dependent diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, and COPD. He had no history of prior therapy with a radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, or brachytherapy. He was taking opioid pain medications at the time of this event. He also experienced nonserious Grade 2 constipation and decreased appetite prior to his death. His last bowel movement was reportedly 10 days before the onset of the bowel distention event. He died at home and no autopsy was performed. This death is possibly related to Ra-223, but is significantly confounded by the use of concomitant opioid medication, decreased appetite/poor oral intake, and a medical history that includes diverticulitis and diabetes. Disease progression is also a potential confounding factor due to his intact prostate and locally advanced disease at baseline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Physical Health Deterioration Deaths:</head><p>Deaths related to general physical health were reviewed to evaluate if any of these deaths were likely related to Ra-223. All of these deaths were most likely due to progression of disease, disease-related comorbidities, or comorbid patient conditions. Four of the five deaths (Patient #017-017; #017-030; #028-002; #173-009) on the Ra-223 arm included rapidly rising PSA levels and/or signs of clinical disease progression such as worsening bone pain or pathologic fracture. The remaining death (Patient #078-003) was a 74-year old man with CRPC (T2b, EOD= &gt; 20 lesions; Total Gleason= 9) who died approximately 65 days after his sixth injection of Ra-223 "due to continued worsening of general conditions". No relevant laboratory tests or treatment information was provided approximate to his death. The Investigator reported that the death was unrelated and due to prostate cancer.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: Despite potential confounding factors, the contribution or additive effect of the Ra-223 to the bone marrow failure/suppression and hemorrhagic death are biologically and clinically possible given the bone marrow suppression adverse reactions associated with Ra-223. It is difficult to interpret if bone marrow suppression and/or failures are due to disease progression with bone marrow infiltration or due to Ra-223 induced toxicity. These interpretations are limited to clinical factors that would suggest disease progression such as increasing pain, changes in laboratory parameters, reductions in performance status, increases in PSA, or temporal presentation of other likely disease-related events (e.g., pathologic fractures). Treatment emergent bone scans and autopsies were also not available for review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deaths Within 30 days of Drug Initiation and Drug Discontinuation</head><p>All deaths (including disease progression) occurring within 30 days after initiation of study therapy were more common in placebo-treated patients compared to Ra-223-treated patients [1.7% (5/301) vs. 0.8% (5/600), respectively]. On the Ra-223 arm, Investigators attributed four out of five of the deaths to prostate cancer. The one death (#133-012) not attributed to prostate cancer occurred within one day of the first dose of Ra-223 after the patient left the clinical center. The cause of this death was reported by the patient's wife and attributed to dyspnea. The Investigator attributed the most likely (probable) cause of the fatal dyspnea to be due to a "pulmonary embolism due to a coagulation disturbance secondary to prostate cancer". Platelet Overall, nonfatal serious adverse events (SAEs) reported in the BC1-06 trial occurred more frequently in the placebo arm when compared to the Ra-223 arm. The most common SAEs reported were malignant neoplasm progression, which occurred in approximately 5% of the patients on both study arms. Consistent with other safety findings, there were small increases in thrombocytopenia and dehydration SAEs on the Ra-223 arm compared to the placebo arm. The gastrointestinal and hemorrhagic SAEs reported in the BC1-06 trial were comparable across Clinical Review Paul G. Kluetz -Efficacy â€¢ William Pierce -Safety NDA 203971 Radium-223 dichloride 94 treatment arms (this analysis is limited to SAEs, please see Vascular Hemorrhage below). Including the SAE for rectal hemorrhage (Patient #9050-018) in the 90-Day safety report, gastrointestinal hemorrhage SAEs occurred at an incidence of 0.8% on the Ra-223 arm and 0.7% on the placebo arm; gastrointestinal ulceration and perforation SAEs occurred at an incidence of 0.5% on the Ra-223 arm compared to 0.7% on the placebo arm. There were no increases in any, minor (e.g., epistaxis, hematemesis, hematuria), or major [e.g., cerebral hemorrhage, cerebrovascular accident (hemorrhagic), urinary tract/bladder/prostatic hemorrhage, or gastrointestinal hemorrhage] hemorrhagic SAEs on the Ra-223 arm compared to the placebo arm in the BC1-06 trial.</p><p>Since the primary excretion pathway for Ra-223 is fecal with minimal renal excretion, and the dosimetry for Ra-223 predicts low renal organ radiation exposure, direct nephrotoxicity associated with Ra-223 is not expected. On the Ra-223 arm, the increase in renal failure and impairment is primarily driven by urinary tract obstruction that is likely disease-related (i.e., Patient #006-001; #028-003; #037-007; #042-030; #043-012; #041-010). These SAEs were treated with nephrostomy or catheterization procedures, with five out of six resolving, and three patients receiving additional Ra-223 without recurrence of the renal SAEs (i.e., negative rechallenge). The two cases reported on the placebo arm (Patient#017-028; #133-029) were also likely related to obstructive or pelvic metastases. Similarly, the hydronephrosis SAEs were all due to urinary obstruction and confounded by disease progression; none were attributed to Ra-223 by the study investigators. All eight hydronephrosis SAEs reported on the Ra-223 arm were treated with a nephrostomy and/or urinary catheterization procedure performed to restore urinary function (e.g., positive dechallenge). Seven out of eight of the hydronephrosis SAEs resolved after the procedures with four patients being retreated with Ra-223 without recurrence of the hydronephrosis SAE (i.e., positive rechallenge).</p><p>Since Ra-223 is related to increases in gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and dehydration that may affect fluid status; the contribution of Ra-223 is possible for the remaining five non-obstructive renal insufficiency or failure SAEs (Patient #'s: #039-027; #070-003; #071-006; #154-004; #204-001) (0.8% vs. 0% on placebo). These five renal SAEs do not appear to be related to urinary obstruction. Two SAEs ruled out obstruction diagnostically (#071-006; #204-001); one SAE was attributed to "exsiccosis" (#154-004); one SAE was attributed to heart failure in the presence of anorexia and nausea suggestive of hypovolemia (#070-003); and one SAE included no evidence of urinary obstruction (#036-027). All five of the patients experienced at least one of the following AEs: dehydration, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea ARs temporally with these SAEs. One SAE (#204-001) was considered "possibly related" to Ra-223 by the Investigator. The median onset of these renal SAEs was 20 days (range: 17-24 days) after the last dose of Ra-223. Three cases were treated with intravenous fluids, with two cases also reporting diuretic treatment; the other two cases did not report specific treatments administered for the SAEs. Four of the five cases resolved after treatment. In addition to advanced age [median=74 years (range= 62 -76 years)], all of the patients had at least one risk factor for renal insufficiency (three patients had hypertension) or were taking concomitant NSAID therapies for pain (4 patients). </p></div>

If the AEs likely related to progression of disease such as malignant neoplasm progression and metastases to the CNS, liver, and lung are removed; the increase on the placebo arm is maintained compared to the Ra-223 arm (16.7% vs. 13.1%; respectively).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risk of Bone Sarcomas and other Secondary Malignancies</head><p>Treatment with Ra-223 results in independent radiation exposure and increased cumulative radiation exposure for patients who have received other radiation-based therapies to prostate cancer. Based primarily on long term epidemiology studies of non-cancer patients exposed to other radium-224, and the nonclinical data for Ra-223; Ra-223 is assumed to be carcinogenic even at relatively low dose levels. The Ra-223 exposure levels required to significantly increase the risk of secondary cancers have not been established. In non-cancer patient populations, radiation exposure with short-lived, alpha-emitting, radium-224 resulted in a significant increased risk of bone sarcoma. Long term epidemiologic data also suggests an increased risk of secondary solid tumors and leukemia. For radium-224, bone sarcoma incidence peaked approximately 8 years after the initial exposure and these cancers were reported approximately 4 -33 years after initial exposure. Nearly all of the non-skeletal solid and soft tissue tumors related to radium-224 occurred at least five years after radium-224 exposure. See Section 7.2.6 for more information on alpha-emitting radionuclide class-related toxicities and secondary malignancies. patients who reached three years of follow-up, 10 patients have been re-consented to permit continuation of follow up, six patients died shortly after the 3 year follow-up visit, and six patients have not been re-consented. The other Ra-223 trials included in the ISS had limited follow up for long term toxicities for relatively short periods of time (e.g., up to two years). <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 48</ref> was provided by the Applicant in response to an FDA information request to update and describe the duration of follow up for the patients in the BC1-06 trial. Despite the lack of long term follow up sufficient to adequately evaluate an association between Ra-223 and bone sarcomas and other secondary cancers, FDA reviewed the available data for secondary cancers that were observed in the Ra-223 trials. <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 49</ref> lists the secondary malignancies that occurred in the BC1-06 trial and in other Ra-223 trials reported as of December 1, 2012 (90-Day SU cutoff date). For the BC1-06 trial, the overall incidence of malignant secondary cancers was low with a slightly lower incidence on the Ra-223 arm compared to placebo (0.8% vs. 1.7%). A majority of the secondary malignancies reported were non-serious non-melanoma or cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (0.7% vs. 1.0%); these were also more common on the placebo arm. On the Ra-223 arm, only one other solid malignancy (0.2%) was reported on the Ra-223 arm; a Grade 2 bladder cancer. Two solid tumor malignancies (0.7%) were reported on the placebo arm; one was a fatal gastric cancer, and the other a rectal adenocarcinoma that was resectable. In the ISS for Ra-223, there was one additional bladder cancer (superficial), one (each) rectal cancer, one fatal pancreatic cancer, and fatal squamous cell malignancy of unknown primary. The patient with squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary in the lung was the same patient who was later found to have squamous cell carcinoma of the penis. Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the penis is an uncommon cancer and reports will be followed closely for other patients with this malignancy. The total incidence of solid non-cutaneous malignancies in the Ra-223 ISS database is approximately 0.4%. No cases of bone sarcoma have been reported in any clinical trial with Ra-223 as of December 1, 2012. The Applicant considers none of the cases of secondary malignancies to be attributable to Ra-223 based on biodistribution and the typical latency period required for radiation-induced malignancies.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: There was no increase or clear association between any secondary malignancies for Ra-223 when delivered at the 50 kBq/kg dose once every 28 days for a duration of six administrations. Given the latency period for solid tumors related to radium exposure, these cancers are probably not related to Ra-223 exposure, but the contribution of Ra-223 can not be completely ruled out. The risk of secondary malignancy is likely greatest for bone sarcoma; none were reported in the Ra-223 integrated safety database (n=904 patients). However, given the short duration of follow up for nearly all of these patients in the Ra-223 database, and the relatively long latency period for bone sarcomas and other secondary malignancies to present, it is also unlikely that there would be any cases or data to support a clear association with Ra-223 at this point. Collection of this type of data would require a significant duration of follow up in a patient population with a longer life expectancy. Given the overall survival and the delay in the time to SRE benefits for Ra-223, submission of this data prior to approval would not be required. For the proposed patient population, this concern is of Clinical </p></div>

The results summarized are based on the FDA QT-IRT consultative review. See the FDA QT-IRT review and Clinical Pharmacology review for more information.</p><p>In the BC1-06 trial, the Applicant conducted a study to evaluate QTc interval prolongation in a subgroup of the patient population. All 12-lead ECGs were collected in triplicate and were measured at &gt; -1 hour, -45 minutes, -30 minutes, + &lt; 1 minute, +30 minutes, and +1, +2, +3, and + 4 -6 hours after injection. An additional ECG was collected at the 4-week and 24-week follow up visit after discontinuation of study therapies. A copy of all ECG measurements was sent electronically to the core ECG laboratory for interpretation. Analysis of the ECGs was performed by a Board-Certified independent cardiologist in a blinded manner. A total of 29 patients were included in the substudy, with 21 receiving Ra-223 and eight receiving placebo. Two patients #017026 (placebo) and #017030 (Ra-223) had a history of cardiac arrhythmia. Four patients, #001039 (Ra-223), #017026 (placebo), #148019 (Ra-223) and #148021 (placebo) had been treated with concomitant medication that could prolong the QT interval and/or induce Torsade de Pointes (TdP).</p><p>There were no clinically relevant morphological changes in the ECGs and no adverse events as per ICH E14 guidance were reported (i.e., syncope, seizure, significant ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death) in this substudy. The FDA IRT reviewer determined that the mixed model of the pooled post-dose data for âˆ†QTcF, heart rate (HR), PR analyses, and QRS analyses was the better correction method for the study data provided. The largest upper bound of the 2sided 90% CI for the mean difference between Ra-223 and placebo for QTcF was 8.3 msec. No patient's QTcF was above 480 msec in the Ra-223 treatment group. In all patients the change from baseline was below 30 msec. The largest upper limit of the 90% CI for the HR mean difference between Ra-223 and placebo is 4.6 beats per minute (bpm) with only one patient experiencing a HR greater than 100 bpm. The largest upper limit of the 90% CI for the PR mean difference between Ra-223 and placebo is 14.5 msec. There are 4 (20.0%) patients in the Ra-223 group and 3 (37.5%) patients in the placebo group who experienced a PR greater than 200 msec. No post-baseline PR intervals were &gt; 10% from baseline values. The largest upper limit of the 90% CI for the QRS mean difference between Ra-223 and placebo is 4.3 msec. There are 3 (14.2%) patients in the Ra-223 group and 1 (12.5%) patient in the placebo group who experienced QRS interval greater than 110 msec. <ref type="figure">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</ref>--This is a representation of an electronic record that was signed electronically and this page is the manifestation of the electronic signature.   </p></div>

The proposed labeled indication of CRPC with bone metastases is more broad than the study population. The inclusion of patients with visceral metastatic disease may be considered a safety issue given the fact that this agent will not treat disease outside of the bone. Delaying systemic treatment for 6 months in the setting of significant lymphadenopathy or visceral metastatic disease may result in progression of the non-bone disease to a point where the window for treatment with subsequent systemic therapy is closed. Treatment Arm: Up to 6 doses of Ra-223 at 50 kBq/kg b.w. in 4 week intervals + Best Supportive Care (BSoC). â€¢ Placebo Arm: Up to 6 doses of Isotonic Saline in 4 week intervals + BSoC.Concomitant Prostate Cancer Therapy:â€¢ Patients must have had orchiectomy or be maintained on LHRH throughout the study â€¢ Bisphosphonates, analgesia, EBRT, steroids, estrogens, estramustine, ketoconazole and anti-androgens were permitted â€¢ Blood transfusions and erythropoietin stimulating agents were permitted â€¢ Cytotoxic agents, systemic radioisotopes, hemibody EBRT or other investigational drugs were prohibited and prompted treatment discontinuation.

Note that there were no scheduled imaging assessments in this study with an overall survival primary endpoint. Clinical progression was considered ECOG deterioration or new skeletal related events. Pain was not specifically identified as a PRO endpoint, however some pain information was obtained as a component of the FACT-P and indirectly via concomitant medications (WHO analgesic scale).

It was noted that not all EBRT procedures are conducted for relief of skeletal pain (CNS metastases, bulky lymphadenopathy, etc.) and that some of the discrepancies were due to this problem of EBRT attribution. The same can be said of orthopedic procedures which may not be an SSE if performed for a non-cancer related issue (traumatic fracture from a motor vehicle accident). Furthermore, SSEs could be captured in 3 places in the CRF: efficacy event (EE) page, concomitant procedure page or adverse event page. The key efficacy event page contained a yes/no question for each of the four SSE components. The pre-specified analysis for time to SSE was conducted by utilizing only data recorded on the efficacy event CRF page and thus missed events captured as AEs or as Concomitant Procedures.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Clinical Review</cell></row><row><cell>Paul G.

The post-hoc analysis revealed a delay in time to SSE favoring Ra-223 (HR 0.60; 0.46 -0.79, p 0.00022). The median time to first SSE was 13.5 months for Ra-223 and 8.1 months for placebo.

The report includes updated major safety results from the BC1-06 trial, ongoing Ra-223 trials (i.e., BC1-09, BC1-10, 16216, and 15354), and the Ra-223 expanded access program (i.e., 15995). For the BC1-06 trial, a majority of the patients had completed the 12-week follow up visit after discontinuation of study therapies before the original NDA safety cutoff date (July 15, 2011). Therefore, the BC1-06 data in the 90-Day SU is primarily comprised of updated death information with a limited number of posttreatment AEs and SAEs. In the BC1-06 trial, 25 patients originally randomized to the placebo arm were crossed over and treated with Ra-223; 15 crossover patients received six doses of Ra-223 and ten patients received between 1-5 doses. With the exception of the crossover patients, there were no significant changes in Ra-223 exposure.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Clinical Review</cell></row><row><cell>Paul G.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>There was an increase in permanent discontinuation due to bone marrow suppression on the radium arm compared to the placebo arm (5.3% vs. 2.7%). There were more AEs that led to permanent treatment discontinuation due to progression of disease on the Ra-223 arm. This was driven by a small increase in discontinuation due to metastases to non-skeletal sites (i.e., CNS (n=2), liver (n=3), and lungs (n=2) on the Ra-223 arm.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The small increase in progression of metastatic disease at non-skeletal sites on the radium arm is likely related to the inability of Ra-223 to treat visceral metastases due to rapid distribution to the bone and the short travel length of alpha-emission.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade 3 and 4 AEs</head><p>Overall there were fewer Grade 3-4 AEs in patients on the Ra-223 arm (59%) compared to the placebo arm (65%). When comparing Ra-223-treated patients to placebo, the largest increases in Grade 3-4 AEs were related to thrombocytopenia (6.5% vs. 2.0%; respectively), neutropenia (2.0% vs. 0.3%; respectively), leukopenia (1.7% vs. 0.3%; respectively), and pancytopenia (1.2% vs. 0.0%; respectively). There were no other increases of &gt; 1 % for any Grade 3-4 ARs in the BC1-06 trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bone Marrow Suppression, Pancytopenia, and Blood Transfusions</head><p>Pancytopenia (N=12), bone marrow failure (1), and aplastic anemia (1) were reported on the Ra-223 arm. There were no reports of these events on the placebo arm. One patient (034-004) died due to bone marrow failure 76 days after his 2 nd injection of Ra-223. Nine of the Grade 1-4 AE were serious (SAEs) and eight were Grade 3 or 4 in severity. The median onset for these AEs was 28 days (range= 1-70 days) after the last injection of Ra-223. A majority (n=8 patients) of the events occurred after the patient had received his sixth scheduled injection of Ra-223. Investigator attribution to Ra-223 was probable for five patients, possible for five patients, and not related for three patients. Patients experiencing these events had a median age of 66 years (Range: 57-78 years). All but one patient (#139-009) had prior docetaxel (n=11); EBRT to the bone (n= 6) or prostate (n=2); or systemic radiation (n=1; Sm-153). Three of the patients who received docetaxel were also previously treated with mitoxantrone. No patients were retreated with Ra-223 after these AEs occurred. For the nonfatal AEs, ten of the patients required blood transfusions, with two patients receiving platelets, and two receiving whole blood transfusions. A majority of the AEs (n=8) were reported as ongoing or not recovered at the time of death. Five patients recovered from the AEs after blood transfusions; two patients recovered without blood transfusions. For the patients experiencing these AEs, the median baseline platelet count was 219 X 10 9 / L (range: 115 -498 X 10 9 / L) and median baseline hemoglobin was 12.0 g/dL (range: 9.1 -15.0). Based on the last platelet level available for these patients, four patients had platelet recovery to &gt; 100 X 10 9 / L, two patients to &gt; 75 X 10 9 / L, one patients to &gt; 50 X 10 9 / L (Grade 2 or less), and six patients did not achieve post-radium doses of &gt; 50 X 10 9 / L (i.e., no Clinical Review Paul G. Kluetz -Efficacy â€¢ William Pierce -Safety NDA 203971 Radium-223 dichloride 97 resolution to Grade 2 or less). Patient #139-009 experienced Grade 3 pancytopenia (probably related per Investigator) after receiving the sixth injection of Ra-223 that recovered. A diagnosis of aplastic anemia was provided for only one patient (#149-009). Patient #149-009 had received multiple prior cytotoxic and radiation therapies [i.e., docetaxel, EBRT to bone (30 Gy and 10 Gy), and Samarium-153]. His baseline platelet count was 252 X 10 9 / L with a hemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL. He recovered with sequelae (e.g., Grade 3 platelet counts and Grade 2 hemoglobin with transfusions) and was alive at the safety study cutoff date approximately one year after discontinuation of Ra-223.</p><p>Platelet value analyses are complicated by the blood transfusions administered and incomplete reporting of unscheduled laboratory values. In the randomized controlled trial, blood transfusion and erythropoietin were used to manage myelosuppression, and G-CSF was used to manage persistent or febrile neutropenia. For both study arms, 41% of the patients required blood transfusions. Ra-223-treated patients were treated with more of the following compared to patients treated with placebo: blood transfusions (42% vs. 39%; respectively), erythropoietin (3.2% vs. 1.7%; respectively), and G-CSF / PEG-G-CSF (1.5% vs. 0%; respectively). Monitor patient blood counts values, identify negative trends, and initiate supportive care measures to manage bone marrow suppression when clinically indicated.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: Most of the patients enrolled in the BC1-06 trial have prostate cancerrelated anemia that requires close monitoring of blood cell counts. It appears that a majority of the patients who experienced Grade 3 or 4 grade thrombocytopenia ARs were monitored closely and managed with whole blood or platelet transfusions (18 out of 39 patients).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vascular Hemorrhage</head><p>In patients with bone marrow suppression, there was a small increase (1.2% vs. 0.3%) in deaths related to vascular hemorrhage for patients treated with Ra-223 compared to patients treated with placebo. See Section 7.3.1.2 for more information. Increases in total, minor, or major hemorrhagic SAEs were not observed on the Ra-223 arm compared to the placebo arm in the BC1-06 trial. See Section 7.3.2 for more information. When comparing the Ra-223 arm to the placebo arm, there was a small increase in Grade 1-4 hemorrhage, bleeding, and hematoma AEs (reported without trauma) (3.8% vs. 3.0%; respectively). This difference appears to be driven primarily by small increases in Grade 1-3 gastrointestinal hemorrhage (2.0% vs. 1.3%; respectively) and hematoma (0.5% vs. 0.0%; respectively) (MedDRA HLGT terms). Most of these AEs are Grade 1 or 2; there was a small increase in Grade 3 gastrointestinal hemorrhages (0.7% vs. 0.0%, respectfully). Including the SAE for rectal hemorrhage (Patient #9050-018) in the 90-Day safety report, the rate of gastrointestinal hemorrhage is 2.1% vs. 1.3% (respectively).</p><p>Reviewer Comment: There was a small increase in Grade 1-3 gastrointestinal hemorrhage and in fatal vascular hemorrhages, and information related to these hemorrhagic effects will be recommended for inclusion in the prescribing information. The slight increase in gastrointestinal bleeding on the Ra-223 arm is consistent with the small increases in Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia. A majority of these cases are Grade 1 or 2. An increase in </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Long term bone marrow suppression and subsequent chemotherapy</head><p>Follow up visit #1 was scheduled for 90 days after the last dose of Ra-223 or placebo. <ref type="table">Table 46</ref> lists the incidence of hematologic toxicity for all patients who had continued bone marrow suppression at the F/U #1 visit.

For two out of four of the patients (#006-015; #066-001) who had Grade 3-4 neutropenia on the Ra-223 arm, subsequent cytotoxic chemotherapy was initiated after completion of Ra-223 therapy and prior to Follow Up Visit #1. With the exception of Patients #006-015 and #066-001, none of these other patients went on to receive additional cytotoxic chemotherapy. On the Ra-223 arm, all of the patients who experienced Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia had received cytotoxic chemotherapy before enrolling in the BC1-06 trial, with the exception of one patient (#074-002), who had been treated with previous EBRT to the bone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment: Interpretation of small changes in the hematologic laboratory toxicities at follow-up #1 are complicated by subsequent chemotherapy and the fact that ~40% of the patients on this trial received blood transfusions. After Follow-Up Visit #1, &lt; 50% of the patients on each arm have laboratory values available for analysis.</head><p>Hematologic laboratory abnormalities were reviewed for patients in the BC1-06 trial who did not receive subsequent chemotherapy after completion of study therapy (n=754). <ref type="table">Table 47</ref> lists the percentage of these patients by CTCAE grade for hemoglobin, neutrophil count, and platelet counts by follow up visit. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Osteonecrosis</head><p>In the BC1-06 trial, osteonecrosis AEs were not common (&lt; 1.0%) and occurred in only five patients; four on the Ra-223 arm (0.7%) and one on the placebo arm (0.3%). All received zoledronic acid. The osteonecrosis AEs reported on the Ra-223 arm were all related to osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), and included one case (each) of "osteonecrosis jaw"', "mandibular necrosis", "mandibular osteonecrosis", and "osteolysis mandible".  The FDA reviewer also reviewed the AEs for pain reported in the jaw and oral pain for potential ONJ AEs. These AEs were also uncommon and balanced across study arms (0.7% on both arms). All four of the PIJ AEs on the Ra-223 arm were nonserious and Grade 1 or 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Severe Gastrointestinal AEs (Perforation, Ulcers, Ileus, Necrosis, Colitis)</head><p>With the exception of gastrointestinal hemorrhage (see above), there were no significant increases of &gt; 2.0% for Grade 1 -4 AEs or &gt; 0.5% for Grade 3-4 AEs for severe gastrointestinal AEs. The incidence of constipation was lower on the Ra-223 arm compared to placebo for Grade 1-4 (18.0% vs. 21.3%; respectively) and Grade 3 -4 (1.0% vs. 1.3%; respectively) AEs. The incidence of Grade 1-4 gastrointestinal stenosis and obstruction was 0.7% on the radium arm compared to 0.3% on the placebo arm (Grade 3-4: 0.5% vs. 0.3%). Gastrointestinal ulceration was not common and occurred at a lower incidence in Ra-223 treated patients (0.2% vs. 0.3%); intestinal perforations occurred at 0.2% vs. 0.7% (respectfully). On the Ra-223 arm, there was one case of duodenitis (erosive) (Patient 021-002) and colitis (Patient #054-001) compared to no cases on the placebo arm. In the 90-Day Safety Update, one patient (#027-002) on the Ra-223 arm experienced severe bowel necrosis. He was a 69-year old man with recurrent constipation and a history of external beam radiation to the sacrum who developed fatal multi-organ failure due to necrosis of the large intestine. Histology did not detect tumor infiltration and described the necrosis as "severe ischemic damaged terminal ileum/mucosa of the colon". Investigator attribution to Ra-223 was possible. The Applicant did not attribute this AE to Ra-223 based on the onset time for the AE. This single case of gastrointestinal necrosis occurred 18 months after discontinuation of Ra-223 and lacks a clear temporal association to the drug.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The single cases of severe gastrointestinal toxicities reported on the BC1-06 trial are not adequate to establish clear associations with Ra-223. FDA will continue to monitor for safety signals for these biologically plausible AEs given the fecal elimination of Ra-223.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AEs for Patients who Experience Constipation:</head><p>The incidence of constipation was lower on the Ra-223 arm compared to placebo for Grade 1-4 (18.0% vs. 21.3%; respectively) and Grade 3 -4 (1.0% vs. 1.3%; respectively) AEs. An information request was sent to the Applicant on January 8, 2013 requesting evaluation of whether patients experiencing constipation experienced higher incidence rates of TEAEs. The Applicant responded on January 25, 2013 (eCTD #0009). The frequency of Grade 1-4 AEs for patients with and without constipation were calculated and compared across the BC1-06 study arms. There was an increase in most of the AEs reported in patients with constipation compared to patients without constipation for both study arms. For the G1-4 ARs related to Ra-223, there were no increases of more than 3% for any specific AR. On the Ra-223 arm, there was an increase in total Grade 3-4 AEs for patients with constipation (75%) compared to patients without constipation (58%). However, this difference appears to be primarily due to conditions possibly related to (or confounded by) disease progression (i.e., bone pain, spinal cord Based on study design limitations for the QT substudy, the QT-IRT concluded that the QT substudy was inconclusive with regards to adequately characterizing Ra-223's ability to prolong the QT interval. The QT-IRT did not consider this a pre-approval issue because there were no AEs of concern in the clinical program and the substudy did not include any large effects on the QTc interval. The primary issues in the QT substudy were related to the trial design; only collecting ECGs up to 4-6 hours post-dose (inadequate to cover the potential delayed effects over 24 hours); and the lack of collection of time-matched PK samples (negates the ability to conduct exposure-response analyses).</p><p>The potential risk of Ra-223 causing delayed effects on the QTc interval of treated patients 4-6 hours post-dose appears to be very limited when considering the lack of cardiac safety signals, clinical pharmacokinetics for elimination, the absorbed radiation dose to the heart, and the relatively small dose of Ra-223 compared to calcium concentrations in the blood (e.g., potential electrolyte shifts). Evaluation of the clinical pharmacology and radiation dosimetry for Ra-223 shows that there is rapid clearance of Ra-223 from the blood and limited distribution of the Ra-223 to the heart. Fifteen minutes post injection, about 20% of the injected radioactivity remained in blood. At 4 hours, about 4% of the injected radioactivity remained in blood. The radiation exposure to the heart wall was estimated to be only 0.0063 Gy. The amount of Ra-223 in each 1000 kBq vial is 0.53 ng Ra-223 and is not clinically relevant in relation to calcium levels in the blood.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: In an internal meeting, the FDA review team for Ra-223 determined that a PMR to repeat the QTc interval substudy for Ra-223 would not be required. This was based on the considerations discussed above and the relatively low risk of Ra-223 causing delayed QT prolongation greater than 4-6 hours after administration. The review team agreed to describe the FDA QT-IRT reviewer's conclusions in the prescribing information with a description of the limitations of the BC1-06 QTc substudy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.5.3">Drug-Demographic Interactions</head><p>No overall differences in safety were observed with regards to age or other demographic factors.</p><p>In the BC1-06 trial, the median age of patients was 71 years (range: 44-90 years) on both arms. Of the 600 patients treated with Ra-223 dichloride in the phase 3 study, 153 patients (26%) were &lt; 65 years of age, 278 patients (46%) were 65-75 years of age, and 169 patients (28%) were &gt; 75 years of age. For these three age categories, the Grade 1-4 adverse events reported in &gt; 5% of the patients on the Ra-223 arm were all comparable with no differences across any of the three arms of &gt; 10%. Nearly all of the AEs reported failed to show consistent increases in incidence with increases in age across the three age categories. For two of the three AEs that did show a consistent increase with age (i.e., anorexia and pathologic fracture), the differences across the three age categories were all &lt; 5%. Asthenia increased from 3.3% to 4.3% to 10.7% across the age categories respectively, but remained comparable to the incidence of asthenia reported in placebo patients &gt; 75 years of age (8.0%).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.6.1">Human Carcinogenicity</head><p>Animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Ra-223. However, in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats, osteosarcomas, a known effect of bone-seeking radionuclides, were observed at clinically relevant doses 7 to 12 months after the start of treatment. The presence of other neoplastic changes, including lymphoma and mammary gland carcinoma, was also reported in 12-to 15-month repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats.</p><p>See the Nonclinical Pharmacology and Toxicology review for detailed information. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.6.2">Human Reproduction and Pregnancy Data</head><p>Genetic toxicology studies have not been conducted with Ra-223. However, the mechanism of action involves induction of double-strand DNA breaks, which is a known effect of radiation. Animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the effects of Ra-223 on male or female fertility or reproductive function. Ra-223 may impair fertility and reproductive function in humans based on its mechanism of action. The prescribing information will include information related to precautions for patients of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment and for a minimum of 6 months following completion of Ra-223 treatment. Although the proposed indication in this application is a disease only found in men, it is possible that women with bonerelated metastases from other tumors could receive Ra-223 "off-label"; therefore Ra-223 is contraindicated in women.</p><p>See the Nonclinical Pharmacology and Toxicology review for detailed information.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.6.4">Overdose, Drug Abuse Potential, Withdrawal and Rebound</head><p>As currently dispensed, the risk for overdose with Ra-223 is low. While there is no specific clinical experience with overdose of Ra-223, single dose animal toxicology studies were conducted with intravenous Ra 223 dichloride administration up to approximate human equivalent doses of 500 kBq/kg in rats and 250 kBq/kg in dogs. The findings in these studies appear to be consistent with findings in the repeat-dose toxicology studies in rats and dogs at lower Ra-223 dichloride doses and adverse events in humans, but with greater incidence and severity. There were dose-dependent increases in myelotoxicity marked by decreases in red blood cells, hematocrit, hemoglobin, white blood cells, platelets and granulocytes, decreases in cellularity of the bone marrow, and increased splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis. There were also dose-dependent decreases in body weights. In rats, there were additional findings including depletion of osteoclasts and osteoblasts and disruption of the physis/growth plate in the femur and of the bone socket of growing teeth. The single-dose study in dogs included retinal detachment at the highest dose, but this was likely a species specific finding. These findings are in addition to the neoplastic changes in rats. Many of the rats administered higher doses of Ra-223 dichloride died within 1 year of receiving a single dose, likely due to neoplastic changes including osteosarcomas and related metastases.</p><p>Based on the mechanism of action, known clinical toxicity at the approved dose and existing animal data on higher doses, if accidental overdose occurs, patients should be monitored closely </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.7">Additional Submissions / Safety Issues</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bowel Movement Frequency Monitoring</head><p>According to the Applicant's proposed labeling, fecal excretion is the major route of elimination from the body for Ra-223 with up to 5% eliminated through the kidneys. The whole body measurements of Ra-223 approximately seven days after injection indicate that a median of 76% of administered activity was excreted from the body. The secretion/excretion of radium from blood into the small intestine is believed to occur primarily through the small intestine wall via transport mechanisms for other divalent cations (e.g., Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ and Ba 2+ ). Based on the calculated absorbed doses to the gastrointestinal tract, the intestines also appear to be the dominant excretory organ. The rate of elimination from the gastrointestinal tract was influenced by the variability in intestinal transit times across the population. Based on these considerations; patients, providers, and caregivers should carefully monitor bowel movement frequency after administration of Ra-223</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Radiation protection</head><p>The administration of Ra-223 is associated with potential risks for medical staff, care givers and members of the patient's family from radiation or contamination from spills of body fluids such as feces or urine. Therefore, radiation protection precautions must be taken in accordance with national and local regulations. Following the normal working procedures for the handling of radiopharmaceuticals and use of universal precautions for patient care is expected to be sufficient given the physical properties of Ra-223. Due to the fecal elimination pathway of Ra-223, patients should use a toilet and the toilet should be flushed several times after each use whenever possible. Clothing soiled with Ra-223 or patient fecal matter or urine should be washed promptly and separately from other clothing. In the event of spillage of Ra-223, the local radiation protection advisor should be contacted immediately to initiate the necessary measurements and required procedures to decontaminate the area.</p><p>Ra-223 is primarily an alpha emitter, with a 95.3% fraction of energy emitted as alpha-particles. The fraction emitted as beta-particles is 3.6%, and the fraction emitted as gamma-radiation is 1.1%. The external radiation exposure associated with handling of patient doses is considerably lower than other therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals as the administered radioactivity will usually be below 8,000 KBq (216 microcurie). In keeping with the As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) principle, for minimization of radiation exposure, it is recommended to minimize the time spent in radiation areas, to maximize the distance to radiation sources, and to use adequate shielding. Any unused product or materials used in connection with the preparation or administration are to be treated as radioactive waste and should be disposed of in accordance with local regulations.</p><p>The gamma radiation associated with the decay of Ra-223 and its daughters allows for the radioactivity measurement of Ra-223 and the detection of contamination with standard instruments.</p><p>See the FDA primary CMC review for detailed information related to safe handling, radiation protection, instructions for preparation, and dose calibration.</p></div>
