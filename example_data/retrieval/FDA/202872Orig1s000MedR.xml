			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The nonclinical safety profile of loteprednol etabonate (LE) has been evaluated as a 0.5% ophthalmic suspension under NDA 20-583 (approved March 1998). To specifically support the development and registration of the loteprednol etabonate (LE) gel formulation, three pharmacokinetic ocular distribution studies and two repeat dose ocular toxicology studies were conducted in rabbits. The in vivo pharmacokinetic distribution studies were conducted to characterize the ocular and systemic pharmacokinetic profile of loteprednol etabonate after topical ocular administration of the polycarbophil-based gel to rabbits. The pharmacokinetic studies were conducted with loteprednol etabonate formulations containing either 30ppm or 50ppm benzalkonium chloride (BAK), and up to 1% of loteprednol etabonate. The two toxicology studies evaluated the safety profile of the LE new gel. The toxicology studies included a 29-day repeat topical ocular dose study in rabbits and a 27-day systemic exposure to loteprednol etabonate.The current label for the marketed loteprednol etabonate (LE) states that LE was not genotoxic in a battery of genotoxicity tests. LE has been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic. No carcinogenic studies have been conducted for LE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OSI</head><p>An Office of Scientific Investigations (OSI) audit was requested. Two domestic clinical investigators were selected for inspection. The sites were chosen on the basis of enrollment of large numbers of study subjects per site, large number of INDs in the OSI database, and absence of previous inspectional history.</p><p>Lotemax (loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic gel) 0.5% is recommended to be approved for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery.</p><p>There is substantial evidence of effectiveness consisting of adequate and well controlled studies which demonstrate that Lotemax (loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic gel) 0.5% is superior to vehicle in the resolution of post-operative anterior chamber cell and flare and superior to vehicle in the resolution of post-operative pain following ocular surgery.</p></div>

These studies were prospective, multi-center, double-masked, parallel group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LE ophthalmic gel, 0.5% compared to vehicle in the treatment of inflammation and pain following cataract surgery. Postoperatively, subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive LE Gel or vehicle. Seven study visits were scheduled during the four-week study period.</p><p>Visit 1 was the Screening Visit. Visit 2 was the day of surgery. At Visit 3 (Post-operative Day 1), eligibility for randomization was assessed. Eligible subjects completed post-operative study Visits 4 through 7.</p><p>Subjects instilled one or two drops of masked study drug into the study eye four times a day, at approximately four hour intervals for 14 days. The initial dose occurred at Visit 3 (Postoperative Day 1). The last dose was administered on the day before Visit 6 (Postoperative Day 15). Visit 7 was a two week post-treatment follow-up performed at Post-operative Day 18).  In addition, this study will include subjects who meet the following criteria at Visit 3 (Postoperative Day 1) 7. Subjects who have undergone routine, uncomplicated cataract surgery (phacoemulsification with posterior chamber IOL implantation, not combined with any other surgery). 8. Subjects who have Grade 2 anterior chamber cells.</p></div>

Subjects who are expected to require concurrent ocular therapy with immunosuppressants (e.g., Restasis) during the 18 days following cataract surgery or have used immunosuppressants within 30 days prior to surgery. 15 5. Subjects who have known hypersensitivity or contraindication to the study drug(s) or their components. 6. Subjects who have a history or presence of chronic generalized systemic disease that the Investigator feels might increase the risk to the subject or confound the result(s) of the study. 7. Subjects who have a severe/serious ocular condition, or any other unstable medical condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, may preclude study treatment or follow-up. 8. Subjects with elevated IOP ( 21 mmHg), uncontrolled glaucoma, or subjects being treated for glaucoma in the study eye. 9. Subjects who are monocular or have pinholed Snellen VA 20/200 or worse in the nonstudy eye. 10.

In the , the subject was seen in the emergency room three times, for events including hallucinations, anxiety, and a fall with a scalp laceration requiring sutures (considered nonserious adverse events). She was subsequently admitted to the hospital from with diagnoses of hypokalemia and dehydration. She had altered mentation. She was treated with intravenous fluids and was gradually advanced to tolerate a normal diet. She had a psychiatric evaluation, at which time it was recommended that she reinstitute appropriate psychiatric medications.
