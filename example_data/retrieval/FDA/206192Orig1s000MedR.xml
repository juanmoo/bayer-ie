The assessment of clinical benefit was based on the demonstration of a statistically significant improvement in progression-free and overall survival in a single randomized, placebo controlled trial, GO28141, of 495 patients randomized (1:1) to receive vemurafenib in combination with cobimetinib (Vem/Cobi) or vemurafenib in combination with a matched placebo (Vem/Placebo). Consistency across all secondary endpoints and relevant subgroups including BRAF mutation subgroups, V600E and V600K, was demonstrated. Based on the demonstration of efficacy and the favorable benefit/risk assessment, this reviewer recommends approval with post-marketing requirements as detailed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Condition and Current Treatment Options</head><p>Metastatic melanoma is considered serious and life threatening and an orphan disease, affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. annually. Historically, the median survival of these patients has been 6 to 9 months. BRAF V600-mutation positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma accounts for 50-60% of all melanoma. While the prognostic significance of mutation status is unclear, the identification of mutation subtypes has led to the development of BRAF-targeted therapy, and more recently to treatment combinations blocking multiple targets within the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Treatment with combined BRAF-and MEK-inhibitors has become standard of care for this patient population as the addition of a MEK inhibitor to a BRAF inhibitor appears to delay the onset of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">23]</ref>. Combined BRAF and MEK inhibition has the additional benefit of suppressing the paradoxical activation of the ERK signaling in a RAS-dependent manner in tumors, premalignant and normal tissues which is thought to explain the occurrence of cutaneous neoplasms such as keratoacanthomas and squamous-cell carcinomas, melanomas, and other tumors seen with this class of drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[24]</ref>.</p><p>Treatment with the MEK inhibitor, Mekinist (trametinib), in patients receiving the BRAF inhibitor, Tafinlar (dabrafenib), has received accelerated approval for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations as detected by an FDA-approved test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit</head><p>The GO28141 trial demonstrated a statistically significant 50% improvement in investigator assessed progression-free survival in patients randomized to receive Vem/Cobi compared to patients randomized to receive Vem/Placebo [HR 0.50 (95% CI: Clinical Review Ruthann M. Giusti NDA 206192 Cobimetinib in combination with Vemurafenib 15 0.38, 0.67; p&lt;0.0001)]. The median PFS was estimated to be 9.9 months (95% CI: 9.0, NR) for patients randomized to the Vem/Cobi arm and 6.2 months (95% CI: 5.6, 7.4) in patients randomized to the Vem/Placebo arm. Pre-specified secondary endpoints included progression-free survival as assessed by a blinded independent radiology committee (BIRC), overall survival (OS) and BIRC-confirmed overall response rate (ORR). PFS analysis based on BIRC review showed results consistent with the primary analysis [HR: 0.60 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.79); p&lt;0.001)] and all secondary analyses showed consistent results across relevant subgroups. A statistically significant improvement in OS was observed for patients randomized to receive Vem/Cobi compared to those randomized to receive Vem/Placebo [HR: 0.63 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.85); stratified log-rank p-value=0.0019 is less than the nominal significance level of 0.019 based on the interim analysis]. The estimated median OS for patients randomized to receive Vem/Cobi was not reached (NR) at the time of the analysis (95% CI: 20.7, NR) and was 17.0 months (95% CI: 15.0, NR) for patients randomized to receive Vem/Placebo. The BICRconfirmed ORR per RECIST v1.1 was significantly improved in patients randomized to receive Vem/Cobi compared to patients randomized to receive Vem/Placebo [67% (95% CI: 61%, 73%) vs. 45% (95% CI: 39%, 51%); Chi-Square test p-value &lt;0.0001)]. Complete responses were reported in 10% of patients randomized to receive Vem/Cobi and in 5% of patients randomized to receive Vem/Placebo. The median duration of response among responders in the Vem/Cobi arm was not reached (NR) at the time of the analysis (range: 9.3, NA) and was 7.3 months (range: 5.8, NR) among responders in the Vem/Cobi arm. Responses lasting at least 6 months were seen in 25% of responders randomized to the Vem/Cobi arm and in 20% of responders randomized to the Vem/Placebo arm An exploratory analyses of PFS and OS to assess the treatment effect by BRAF mutation subset (V600E and V600K retrospectively classified using Next Gen sequencing in patients pre-screened for study entry using the cobas ® test) was conducted in 81% of patients in the ITT study population who had adequate tissue remaining for analysis. This analysis suggested a similar treatment effect on PFS in both mutation subtypes with no apparent decrement in OS.</p><p>In summary, the GO28141 trial, the single randomized trial supporting efficacy in this NDA, demonstrated a robust, statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in PFS, OS, and ORR with consistency across all secondary endpoints and relevant subgroups with the addition of cobimetinib to vemurafenib therapy. Within the limits of the study design, patients with tumors harboring a BRAF V600E and those with a BRAF V600K appeared to derive a similar benefit with the addition of cobimetinib to vemurafenib therapy. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risk</head><p>In the GO28141, the median duration of exposure to cobimetinib/placebo was 267 days (range 4-563 days) in the Vem/Cobi treatment group and 173 days (range: 5-515 days) in the Vem/Placebo treatment group. The median duration of exposure to vemurafenib was 279 days (range 4-563 days) in the Vem/Cobi treatment group and 175 days (range 5-516 days) in the Vem/Placebo arm. Forty-five percent of Vem/Cobi treated patients and 35% of Vem/Placebo treated patients required a dose modification or interruption during treatment due to an adverse event. The AEs which most commonly resulted in a reduction/interruption of cobimetinib/placebo were: gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhea: 9% vs. 4%; vomiting: 6% vs. 5%; and nausea: 5% vs. 4%), rash (rash, unspecified: 5% vs. 6%; and rash, maculo-papular: 5% vs. 4%), pyrexia (6% vs. 3%), increased blood CPK (5% vs. 1%), and chorioretinopathy (7% vs. 0%).</p><p>Overall, the most frequent (≥ 20%) adverse reactions among patients who received cobimetinib with vemurafenib were: gastrointestinal [diarrhea (60%), nausea (41%) vomiting (24%), rash (rash, unspecified, generalized, macular, maculo-papular and morbilliform) (55%) photosensitivity reaction (46%), arthralgia (36%), fatigue (34%), increased blood creatinine phosphokinase (32%), pyrexia (28%), and elevated alanine aminotransferase (25%) and aspartate aminotransferase (23%).</p><p>Adverse reactions which occurred in ≥ 20% of patients with a higher frequency (between arm difference ≥ 5%, all CTCAE grades or ≥ 2% CTCAE grades 3-4) in patients treated with cobimetinib in addition to vemurafenib compared to vemurafenib alone included: diarrhea (60% vs. 31%), nausea (41% vs. 25%), vomiting (24% vs. 13%), photosensitivity reaction (45% vs. 35%), increased blood creatinine phosphokinase (32% vs. 3%), pyrexia (28% vs. 23%), elevated alanine aminotransferase (25% vs. 18%) and aspartate aminotransferase (23% vs. 18%).</p><p>Serious adverse events (SAEs) were more common among patients who received vemurafenib with cobimetinib than among patients who received vemurafenib alone (35% vs.26%) as were CTCAE Grade 3-4 AEs (28% vs. 22%). The most common (≥ 5%) Grade 3-4 adverse reactions among patients receiving cobimetinib with vemurafenib included diarrhea (7% vs. 1%), increased blood creatinine phosphokinase (11% vs. 0%), elevated alanine aminotransferase (11% vs. 6%) and aspartate aminotransferase (9% vs. 2%), and basal cell carcinoma (5% vs 2%).</p><p>The following were adverse events of special interest: Photosensitivity: Photosensitivity was reported in 47% of patients receiving COTELLIC plus vemurafenib: Grades 1 or 2 events occurred in 43% and the remaining 4% were Grade 3 events. Median time to first onset of photosensitivity events of any grade was 1 month (range 0-14 months). Ninety-five percent of patients with photosensitivity adverse reactions were managed without a change in cobimetinib or vemurafenib.</p><p>No differences were noted in the safety profile of vemurafenib used in combination with cobimetinib in patient subsets defined by age, gender or BRAF V600 mutation subset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis and Recommendation</head><p>Unresectable/metastatic melanoma is a serious and life threatening condition. The identification of mutations in BRAF V600 in a large subset of patients with this disease has led to the development of new targeted therapies, including inhibition of multiple tyrosine kinase targets within the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. For patients with an identified BRAF V600 mutation, the combined use of BRAF-and MEK-targeted therapies has become a standard of care. Genentech proposes cobimetinib (COTELLIC) for use with vemurafenib (ZELBORAF), for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with the BRAF V600 mutations . As demonstrated in the GO28141 trial, the addition of cobimetinib to vemurafenib demonstrates substantial evidence of improvement in PFS, OS, and ORR (efficacy) with a tolerable safety profile in this patient population. The safety profile appears similar to that observed with trametinib, administered with dabrafenib, currently marketed for this patient population under the provisions of the accelerated approval regulations.</p><p>A robust and clinically significant improvement in progression-free and overall survival was demonstrated in the GO28141 which was consistent across secondary endpoints and across relevant subgroups. Based on an analysis of 493 patients treated in the GO28141, 247 patients who received cobimetinib/vemurafenib, and supported by a small number of patients in an open-label dose-finding trial (NO25395), the safety profile and risk/benefit assessment of the addition of cobimetinib to vemurafenib was demonstrated to be acceptable for use in this patient population.</p><p>Patients in the GO28141 trial were selected for study entry based on a positive cobas ® 4800 V600 mutation test which is an approved companion diagnostic test that "is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Reference ID: 3841054 (b) (4)</formula><p>Clinical Review Ruthann M.

This diagnostic has been demonstrated to be highly sensitive for the detection of this mutation but has also been demonstrated to identify a subset of tumors with BRAF V600K mutations. When compared to Bi-Directional Sequencing, the cobas test detected approximately 2/3 of samples with a V600K mutation. In a retrospective analysis of stored tissue available on 81% of the intent-to-treat (ITT) study population of the GO28141, BRAF mutation subset (V600E and V600K) was determined using Next Gen sequencing. The riskbenefit assessment is favorable and appears to be of a similar magnitude in both BRAF V600E and V600K mutation-subsets.</p><p>This reviewer recommends approval for the following indication: COTELLIC ® is indicated for use in combination with vemurafenib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with the BRAF V600E and V600K mutations</p><p>The following key labeling requirements are recommended:</p><p>1.

The initial component of the NDA submission was received on October 30, 2014 with the remaining components received on December 11, 2014. FDA agreed to Genentech's request for priority review. No significant filing issues were identified.  Phase I/II development • The dose-escalation trial of RO5185426 (vemurafenib) in combination with GDC-0973 in patients with BRAF V600E mutated metastatic melanoma (NO25395) was evaluated and found to be safe to proceed. • The dose of 960 mg PO BID vemurafenib in combination with 60 mg PO QD GDC-0973; 21 days on with 7 days off administered in 28 day cycle until progression or excessive toxicity was determined to be the recommended phase 2 dose. <ref type="bibr">Jun 12, 2012</ref> End-of-Phase 1/Pre-Phase 3 • The design of the single randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial of vemurafenib with cobimetinib/placebo in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600 mutations selected using the cobas test was discussed. • It was agreed that the demonstration of a robust, statistically significant and clinically meaningful effect on investigator-assessed PFS, subject to a blinded, independent review could support registration, provided the trial was found to be well-designed and well-conducted. • FDA recommended that the final OS analysis should be sufficiently powered to detect a clinically significant effect on survival. • FDA provided recommendations for monitoring of second primary malignancies, QTc prolongation and ocular toxicity. <ref type="bibr">Aug 9, 2012</ref> New Clinical Protocol, GO28141 registration batches and commercial drug product for release. <ref type="bibr">Apr 22, 2013</ref> Type C (Written Responses) • FDA provided written responses to Genentech's questions concerning the proposed clinical pharmacology plan to assess single-and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics, relative bioavailability and food effect, absolute bioavailability, mass balance and metabolism profile, drug-drug interaction potential and QT prolongation potential. FDA indicated that the conducted and planned clinical pharmacology studies were generally adequate. <ref type="bibr">Nov 21, 2013</ref> Orphan-Drug Designation Granted • Cobimetinib was granted orphan-drug designation for the treatment of stage IIb, IIc, III and IV melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation. <ref type="bibr">Mar 5, 2014</ref> Pre-NDA, CMC • Genentech's proposed commercial specification for cobimetinib 20 mg tablet was discussed. FDA requested that the complete multipoint dissolution profile data for the pivotal trial and registration stability batches at release and on storage be included in the NDA to support setting the final acceptance criterion. • FDA requested that a clear overview of formulation changes throughout development and the effects of these changes on dissolution performance and bioavailability be included. • FDA requested a proposal for acceptance criterion for be provided. • Genentech indicated that they plan to launch the commercial cobimetinib 20 mg tablets in bottles for an alternate Genentech packaging site (Segrate [Italy]). FDA requested that three batches with three months accelerated stability data from the new site be provided no later than 60 days after NDA submission and that long term stability data be submitted in the annual report. Pre-NDA -Type B • FDA agreed that the high level efficacy and safety results from the GO28141 supported by NO25395, MEK4592g and additional clinical pharmacology trials were adequate to support NDA filing. • FDA concurred that the non-clinical and clinical pharmacology information appeared sufficient to support filing of the non-clinical and clinical pharmacology sections of the proposed NDA. • FDA indicated that there were insufficient data to determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) was required. • FDA indicated that provided there were no changes to the device specific to the combination use, a PMA supplement would not be required for the cobas ® 4800 BRAF Mutation Test to support the approval of cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib because the test is used in accordance with the vemurafenib label. However if cobimetinib is developed for use in a new indication that requires a selection of patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumors, a PMA supplement will be required.</p><p>• Genentech indicated their intent to amend the GO28148 Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) and protocol to conduct an earlier assessment of final OS. FDA indicated that in general reducing the number of events for any efficacy analyses after seeing the interim data is not acceptable, accrual to the study is complete and all enrolled patients will be continuously followed. FDA indicated that if the revised SAP was found to be acceptable and if the trial meets the specified threshold for significance as described under the revised SAP, the OS results may be included in the label.

However many of the sponsor's explanations in the data conformance sections for both studies are simply acknowledgements and not quality clarifications. • In the NO25395 trial, data were not collected regarding whether an adverse event was serious or not, making it difficult to independently verify whether an adverse event was serious or not. • Misclassification of patients randomized to the Vem/Placebo arm (this issue is discussed in more detail below).</p><p>The misclassification of the treatment assignment of eight patients originally randomized to the Vem/Placebo arm was identified as an issue by Genentech in the original submission. Re-classification of seven of these patients based on drug kit reconciliation and identification of data entry errors at the time the data lock called into question the overall data integrity of the data for Trial GO28141 in the submission based on potential inadequate drug reconciliation procedures and inadequate on-site monitoring. These concerns required re-analysis of the safety data and ultimately led to a major amendment requiring extension of the review clock.</p><p>At the time of the original submission, Genentech noted that eight patients treated at seven study sites who had been originally randomized to receive Vem/Placebo had inadvertently received cobimetinib. As defined by the statistical analysis plan, these patients were classified with the Vem/Cobi arm for purposes of the safety analysis. At the time of the safety update, Genentech clarified that only one of these errors represented a dispensing error; seven of these patients were later identified as having data entry errors in the site medication dispensing information. These patients were reassigned to the Vem/Placebo arm. In response to an information request dated May 14, 2015, May 19, 2015, and May 27, 2015, Genentech further clarified that drug dispensation and data entry errors occurred in both treatment arms. There were 11 patients randomized to the Vem/Cobi arm who were identified as having received a dose of placebo at the time of the original submission; four of these were identified as having a dispensing error (actually received placebo) and seven were identified as having data entry errors in the site medication dispensing information. Since these patients all received at least one dose of cobimetinib, there was not a change in the treatment assignment for these patients in the safety analysis dataset. Genentech was required to provide a revised safety analysis using the data from the May 9, 2014, data cut-off date with the corrected treatment assignment and to provide updated data sets from the safety update for verification by the FDA.</p><p>Reviewer's comment: Re-analysis of the safety data with the data cut-off date of May 9, 2014, corrected for treatment assignment did not materially change the safety findings</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Compliance with Good Clinical Practices</head><p>Data from the GO28141 were monitored by an external data safety monitoring board (DSMB). The DSMB consisted of clinicians who are experts in the disease area and one statistician. The DSMB reviewed the available safety data from this trial at regularly The investigator ensured that this study was conducted in full conformance with the principles of the "Declaration of Helsinki," or with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research was conducted, whichever afforded greater protection to the individual. The Applicant stated that study fully adhered to the principles outlined in the current "Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP)" International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Tripartite Guideline (January 1997), or with local law if it afforded greater protection to the patient. This was documented by the investigator's signature on the protocol agreeing to carry out all of its terms in accordance with applicable regulations and law and to follow ICH GCP guidelines. For studies conducted in the U.S or under a U.S. IND, the investigator ensured adherence to the basic principles of "Good Clinical Practice" as outlined in the current version of 21 CFR, subchapter D, part 312, "Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators"; part 50, "Protection of Human Patients"; and part 56, "Institutional Review Boards." In other countries where "Guideline for Good Clinical Practice" exists, the Applicant and participating investigators strictly ensured adherence to the stated provisions.</p><p>It was the responsibility of the investigator or designee (if acceptable by local regulations) to ensure that the informed consent form (ICF) from each patient was signed and dated prior to participation in this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, objectives and potential hazards of the study. It was explained to the patients that they were completely free to refuse to enter the study or to withdraw from it at any time, for any reason.</p><p>Based on irregularities identified during routine monitoring of GO28140, Genentech conducted audits at three clinical sites as shown below The Investigator was instructed via a Genentech Safety Notification Memo to inform subjects of new safety information while waiting for the release of a Protocol Amendment and corresponding updated informed consent form (ICF). Confirmation of this verbal communication and the subjects' willingness to continue in the study was not documented in medical records. In addition, there was a delay in the implementation of the protocol amendment and corresponding updated ICF, during which time subjects were not consented with new safety information that may have been be relevant to the their willingness to participate in the study.</p><p>As a corrective action, the new safety information was communicated to subjects, documented in medical records, and their willingness to continue in the study confirmed via the signing of the updated ICF. Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) on the study were. The CRAs were also prompted to monitor the communication and documentation of new safety information to subjects, confirming this verification in site visit reports.</p><p>Genentech reported that no other critical audit findings were observed at the remaining two sites. Pending = Preliminary classification based on information in 483 or preliminary communication with the field; EIR has not been received from the field, and complete review of EIR is pending.</p><p>No significant deviations were found at two of the sites, Dr. Gabriella Liszkay's and Dr. Michele Maio's sites. Some deviations were noted at Dr. Paolo Ascierto's site, however, these deviations were not considered to be major and deviations, once discovered were corrected by the investigator and were not deemed to effect patient safety and the data from this site was judged to be reliable.</p><p>Dr. Virginia Ferraresi's site, which screened 19 patients and enrolled 15 patients onto GO28141, was assessed by the FDA inspector to have significant deviations. From the inspection report: Generally, the investigator's execution of the protocol was found to be marginal. The inspection revealed numerous protocol deviations and GCP compliance deficiencies. The site enrolled one subject into the study without documentation of informed consent. Subsequently, this subject underwent study procedures and treatment with study drug. The site had instances where the protocol specified imaging for subjects were either not done or delayed to a point where the imaging was out of window for that cycle. For example, Subject 2011 did not have tumor assessments performed following protocol timeline (every 8 weeks +/-1 week); at Cycle 7 the tumor assessment was not done, and at Cycle 9 and Cycle 11 tumor assessments were performed but were more than 21 days out of window.</p><p>There was also evidence of underreporting of adverse events. The firm had transcription errors where AEs were inadvertently not transcribed onto the eCRF, and in some cases AEs that occurred prior to the data analyses cutoff date were not transcribed onto the eCRF until after the data cut-off date, May 2014. Therefore, the AEs were not included in the data listings submitted to the application. For example, AEs and concomitant medications that were documented in subject medical records and subject diaries were not always entered in the case report forms. Subjects' diary data not entered into the CRF included headache, nausea, rash, diarrhea, and use of heparin.</p><p>A Form FDA 483 was issued citing five inspectional observations for this site. However, the final classification of this site was VAI.</p><p>Reviewer's comment: Despite significant deviations which occurred at at least one study site, the major efficacy findings were not materially changed with elimination of this site from the primary analysis, as discussed in Section 6.4.1. Elimination of this study site was not deemed to be warranted and data from this study site was included in the final analysis and in labeling.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Population</head><p>Eligibility Criteria:</p><p>BRAF mutation positivity was required for study eligibility. BRAF mutation testing was performed using the cobas ® 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test, either locally or at a central laboratory. When local BRAF mutation test results were used to determine eligibility, documentation confirming the results and use of the cobas test was required. c. Whole brain radiotherapy is not allowed, with the exception of patients who have parenchymal brain lesions 8. Current severe, uncontrolled systemic disease 9. History of malabsorption or other conditions that would interfere with absorption of study drugs 10. The following foods/supplements are prohibited at least 7 days prior to initiation of and during study treatment: a. St. John's Wort or hyperforin (potent CYP3A4 enzyme inducer) b. Grapefruit juice (potent cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitor) 11. Pregnant, lactating or breast feeding</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Treatment</head><p>Cobimetinib (60-mg dose) or matched placebo was taken as three tablets orally once per day at approximately the same time each day on Day 1 through Day 21 of each 28day treatment cycle. At least seven days without cobimetinib was required prior to starting a new treatment cycle. Cobimetinib or placebo was taken with the vemurafenib dose preferably in the morning with water, with or without a meal. Vemurafenib (960 mg dose) was taken as four tablets orally twice daily (in the morning and evening).</p><p>If a dose was not taken within four hours after the scheduled dosing time, the patient was instructed to resume dosing with the next scheduled dose.</p><p>Treatment continued until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred earliest.  The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of cobimetinib as a single agent was determined in the first-in-human study, MEK4592g, to be 60 mg daily, on a 21-day on, 7-day off (21/7) schedule. This schedule was determined to provide a longer duration of MEK suppression at a lower dose with less toxicity than did an alternative 14-day on, 14-day off (14/14) schedule explored in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rationale for Dose Selection</head><p>Study NO25395 (BRIM7), a dose-escalation study of to determine a tolerable and active dose and schedule of cobimetinib, administered with vemurafenib, determined that both drugs could be administered at the respective single-agent MTDs (vemurafenib, 960 mg BID, Days 1-28; cobimetinib 60 mg QD, Days 1-21) which was the recommended dose for future trials of the combination.</p><p>Reviewer's comment: Patients in the control arm of GO28141 received the recommended starting dose of Vemurafenib for patients with advanced BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma. Prior to the accelerated approval of Tafinlar and Mekinist (dabrafenib and trametinib), this was an accepted standard of care for patients in this subset. Vemurafenib and dabrafenib remain an accepted standard of care in patients with advanced BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma who are unable to tolerate the additional toxicity of a MEK inhibitor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dose Modifications and Supportive Care Guidelines</head><p>Recommendations for management of anticipated toxicities (rash, photosensitivity reaction, diarrhea, visual symptoms, new cutaneous primary malignancies, CPK and LFT elevation, QTcF interval prolongation, LVEF reduction and other Grade 4 nonhematologic laboratory abnormalities) and guidelines for dose modifications, interruptions, and delays of vemurafenib and/or cobimetinib/placebo treatment were provided in the clinical protocol (see CSR, 5.1.5.3, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 10</ref>, page 7214). Reduction of each study drug was independent and no re-escalation of dose was allowed. Up to two dose level reductions were allowed before the study drug was discontinued. The recommended dose reductions are shown below. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistics and Analysis Plan</head><p>The reader is referred to Dr. Xiaoping Jian's statistical review for details of the statistical analysis plan for GO28141 which is summarized below.</p><p>As discussed above in Section 5.3.1.1, patients were randomized (1:1) using an interactive response system (IxRS) which employed a permuted-block randomization scheme which stratified on two factors: Geographic region (North America, Europe, Australia/New Zealand/others) and Metastatic classification (unresectable Stage IIIc, M1a, and M1b; or M1c). Patients were assigned to receive one of two study treatments:</p><p>• Vem/Placebo: vemurafenib 960 mg orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on Days 1-28 and placebo once daily (PD) on Days 1-21 of each 28-day treatment cycle, or • Vem/Cobi: vemurafenib 960 mg PO BID on Days 1-28 and cobimetinib (GDC-0973) 60 mg PO QD on Days 1-21 of each 28-day treatment cycle</p><p>Patients continued on treatment until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred earliest. Patients on the Vem/Placebo treatment arm were not offered cobimetinib at the time of disease progression. All patients were followed up for survival.</p><p>The protocol-defined primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by the study investigator and defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression using RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever came first. For patients with no PFS event were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment. Patients with no post-baseline tumor assessment were censored at the randomization date.</p><p>The primary analysis of PFS was a log-rank test stratified by geographic region (North America, Europe, Australia/New Zealand/others) and disease stage (unresectable Stage IIIc, M1a, and M1b; M1c) conducted at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. The primary analysis was based on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as all randomized patients. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the median PFS and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each treatment arm. Hazard ratio and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model stratified by region and metastatic classification. The sample size calculation was based on the assumptions that the true PFS hazard ratio was 0.55 corresponding to median PFS of 6 months in the Vem/Placebo arm and 11 months in the Vem/Cobi arm. A total of 206 events were needed to detect a hazard ratio of 0.55 with 95% power at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05. Taking consideration of enrollment rate of 65 patients per month and 5% dropout rate, approximately 500 patients were planned to be randomized.</p><p>The secondary endpoints for the trial were PFS assessed by a BIRC, overall survival (OS), confirmed overall response rate (ORR) determined by two consecutive investigator assessments performed four or more weeks apart with responses assessed using RECIST v1.1 criteria, and duration of response (DoR).</p><p>The secondary endpoint OS was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimates and compared between two treatment arms using a stratified log-rank test. The stratified OS analyses used the same stratification factors as did the primary PFS analysis. The final analysis will be conducted after 385 events have been observed (at approximately 46 months after the first patient was randomized). ORR was tested by using χ2 test at two-sided alpha of 0.05. A hierarchical order to control the overall family-wise error rate at level α = 0.05 for the secondary endpoints ORR and OS was pre-specified in the protocol and SAP: if the primary analysis of PFS showed statistical significance the ORR would be tested first at the 0.05 level. Only if the comparison of PFS was significant, would the comparison of OS then be tested at the 0.05 level.</p><p>There were two planned interim OS analyses. The first OS interim analysis was conducted at the time of the final PFS; second one would be when 256 (67%) OS events have been observed (it was estimated that the timing would be at approximately 27 months after the first patient was randomized.) The Lan-DeMets implementation of the O'Brien and Fleming spending function was used to control the overall Type I error rate at a significance level of 0.05 (2-sided) for all OS comparisons.</p><p>Patients report outcomes (PRO) measured by EORTC QLQ-C30, were evaluated for patients with a baseline assessment and at least one post-baseline QLQ-C30 assessment that generate a score. Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, 25th and 75th percentiles, and range) of absolute scores of the QLQ-C30 and their changes from baseline were summarized at each assessment time point for the two treatment arms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedures for Retrospective Assessment of BRAF V600 Mutations</head><p>Only patients whose melanoma tumor tested positive for the BRAF V600 mutation assessed locally or centrally using the cobas ® 4800 BRAF V600 mutation test and who met all other eligibility criteria were eligible for enrollment into the trial. Archival or newly obtained tumor samples could be used for BRAF testing. If cobas ® test was locally performed, verification of the mutation status at a central laboratory selected by the After randomization, an additional analysis was retrospectively performed using next generation (Next Gen) sequencing to evaluate BRAF mutation genotype using DNA from patients who submitted archival or baseline tumor tissues and had sufficient DNA remaining after central testing using the cobas ® 4800 BRAF V600 mutation test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Major Protocol Amendments</head><p>As of the cutoff date for the clinical study report, the original protocol, dated August 3, 2012, was amended three times. The major revisions are outlined in the table below.</p><p>Reviewer's comment: The only substantive revision during the conduct of GO28141 was the revision to the statistical analysis plan instituted in version 3 of the clinical protocol which provided for an analysis of PFS as assessed by the BIRC as a secondary endpoint. The other changes implemented in the clinical protocol would not be expected to have a major impact in the assessment of patient safety or efficacy. After the primary analysis for PFS was completed, the protocol was revised (version 5) to provide for a final OS analysis at an earlier timepoint. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Summary</head><p>The NDA submission contained a single, randomized, controlled trial, GO28141, assessing the safety and efficacy of cobimetinib in support of the proposed indication. the study design, patients with tumors harboring a BRAF V600E and those with a BRAF V600K appeared to derive a similar benefit with the addition of cobimetinib to vemurafenib therapy.</p><p>In the NO25395 trial, only 66 patients were BRAF-inhibitor naïve and received the proposed registrational dose and schedule. Of these, the investigator confirmed objective response rate was 87%, somewhat higher that that seen in the GO28141 trial, and of these, 10% were assessed by investigators to be complete responses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.1">Methods</head><p>The Applicant submitted data from a single randomized trial (GO28141) which was adequately designed and conducted to test the hypothesis that in patients with previously untreated, unresectable or metastatic BRAF-mutated melanoma as detected by the cobas® 4800 BRAF V600 mutation test, the addition of cobimetinib to vemurafenib therapy results in an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared to treatment with vemurafenib alone. As described in the protocol and in the statistical analysis plan, PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression, as determined by the study investigators using RECIST v 1.1, or death from any cause. The statistical analysis plan pre-specified a hierarchical order of analysis of the secondary endpoints to control Type 1 error at 0.05.</p><p>Secondary endpoints were to be tested in the following order: confirmed best overall response rate as determined by investigator review and overall survival. No adjustment The review of efficacy is focused on the analysis of data provided for GO28141, including the CSR, the Applicant's presentation slides, case report forms, primary data sets submitted by the applicant. The review is focused on confirming the efficacy findings for GO28141 as presented by the Applicant and assessing in assessing whether sufficient evidence is provided to justify the broader indication sought for use in 1) BRAF-V600 mutation subsets, and 2) patient treated following vemurafenib progression.

The applicant reports that 550 (53%) of patients screened were found to be ineligible for the trial. A line listing detailing the reason for screen failure is provided in the Clinical Study Report (page 7460). Among the 457(83%) patients for whom a cause of screening failure was reported, the most common reasons for screening failure are listed below.</p><p>The single most common reason for screening failure was the absence of a confirmed BRAF V600 mutation as detected by the cobas ® 4800 BRAF V600 mutation test, followed by active CNS disease. Reviewer's comment: With the reason for screening failure missing in 17% of patients reported as screening failure, it is not possible to make a specific assessment of the generalizability of the ITT study population. However, the percentage of patients excluded because BRAF mutation positive status was not confirmed is approximately what would be expected in an unselected study population, 40% to 60%. The proportion of patients excluded for active CNS lesions and because they were unwilling/unable to comply with study procedures appear high. While this may reflect a study population selected for an optimized outcome, this fact is unlikely to impact the internal validity of the trial.</p><p>Based on the study dose modification guidelines (Section .3, page 201), patients with toxicity assessed as being related to cobimetinib/placebo could continue on study on vemurafenib alone in the absence of disease progression or other reason for study discontinuation. Patients with a toxicity assessed as related to vemurafenib could continue on study on cobimetinib/placebo alone in the absence of disease progression or other reason for study discontinuation. In both study arms, the most common reason for discontinuation from one or from both study drugs was disease progression. A higher proportion of patients on the Vem/Placebo arm than on the Vem/Cobi arm discontinued one or both study drugs due to disease progression. A higher proportion of patients on the Vem/Cobi arm than on the Vem/Placebo arm discontinued one or Clinical Review Ruthann M.

Discontinuations for other reasons were infrequent and occurred at a similar rate on both arms <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 14)</ref>. Reviewer's comment: The above analysis does not suggest disproportionate loss in either study arm due to reasons other than adverse events or disease progression which might result in early study termination.</p><p>Overall, the median duration of follow-up in the trial was 7.3 months and was similar in both study arms.

The percent of patients receiving post-trial treatment over all lines of therapy with a BRAF-inhibitor, MEKinhibitor or combined BRAF-, MEK-inhibitor therapy was the same between arms; 24 (10%) patients on the Vem/Placebo arm compared to 18 (7%) of patients received either an anti-PD-1 antibody or Ipilimumab as post-treatment therapy (any line).</p><p>Reviewer's comment: While the optimal sequencing of small molecule targeted therapy, biologic therapy and immunotherapy in the treatment of metastatic melanoma is not well understood, it does not appear likely that the small between arm differences in post-treatment anti-cancer therapy would confound the interpretation of the PFS and OS analyses given the small number of patients in the ITT study population who received these treatments.

The estimates of the prevalence of BRAF codon 600 mutations occurring in patients with metastatic melanoma range from 40% to 60%. The most prevalent mutations in BRAF mutation-positive melanoma are BRAF V600E (about 80%) and BRAF V600K (5-30%). Other mutations are rare. The frequency of BRAFV600K mutation has been reported to increase with age, and to be associated with cumulative sun induced skin damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[13]</ref>, and may be associated with brain and lung metastases and a shorter time from diagnosis to metastasis and death <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[14]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's comment: Since the GO28141 trial pre-screened patients using the cobas 4800 BRAF V600 mutation test which would exclude approximately 1/3 of patients with BRAF V600K mutations. Based on a discussion with CDRH, it is not clear that these patients differ in any systematic way from tumors detected. Lack of detection was felt to be related to DNA quality. It is strictly speaking, unclear how the subset analysis relates to patients not detected by Cobas who may be detected using other testing methods. There However, within the limits of the selection criteria, the retrospective subset analysis by mutation subsets shows a consistent benefit across both mutation subsets and across primary and secondary endpoints. It is therefore likely but not certain that the effect in patients with V600K mutations excluded from the analysis would be similar. Post-marketing confirmation is recommended</head></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.10">Additional Efficacy Issues/Analyses</head><p>The Applicant's development program for cobimetinib administered in combination with vemurafenib contained limited assessment of dose-response. The Applicant conducted one dose-escalation study, NO25395 which is described in section 5.3.1.2. In this trial of 129 patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma as detected by the cobas 4800 BRAF V600 mutation test who were either BRAF inhibitor naive or had recently progressed on a BRAF inhibitor were enrolled onto ten dosing cohorts which explored three PFS survival probability Cohort enrollment was staggered to allow for demonstration at a lower dose before either escalation of cobimetinib or vemurafenib was allowed. The distribution of patients entered into each cohort and the numbers of patients who had progressed following BRAF inhibitor therapy in each cohort is shown below in <ref type="figure">Figure</ref>   The efficacy endpoint for the NO25395 trial was confirmed overall response rate as assessed by study investigators using RECIST v. 1.1. Responses were not independently reviewed. Response rates for patients in all cohorts combined by prior BRAF inhibitor exposure is shown below in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 28</ref>. The confirmed overall response rate (ORR) among BRAF inhibitor naïve patients was 87% (95% CI: 77%, 94%) with complete responses observed in 6 (10%) patients. The median duration of response was 12.5 months (95% CI: 9.7, NE months). The ORR among patients who had progressed following treatment with a BRAF inhibitor was 15% (95% CI: 8%, 26%). All responses were partial responses. In the 10 patients who had an objective response, the median time duration of response was 6.7 months (95% CI: 4.9, NE months). Reviewer's comment: While the waterfall plot shows an interesting response, FDA considers this type of analysis to be exploratory in assessing anti-tumor activity as only target lesions are considered in the assessment and a minimum durability of response is not required. This review of safety focused primarily on assessing the safety of cobimetinib when administered with vemurafenib and in defining the safety profile of cobimetinib. The review focused on data from the GO28141 trial, the single randomized trial submitted by the Applicant to support the safety of cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib which composed 80% of the Integrated Summary of Safety (ISS) and represented 88% of patients treated with the proposed dose and schedule. The size of the safety data base was sufficient to characterize the safety profile of cobimetinib when used in combination with vemurafenib and was sufficient to isolate the effect of cobimetinib when added to vemurafenib. The GO28141 was a multicenter, international, randomized (1:1) active treatment, placebo-controlled trial of 495 patients with previously untreated, unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma, as identified by the cobas 4800 BRAF V600 mutation test. Patients received vemurafenib 960 mg PO BID on Days 1-28 in combination with cobimetinib 60 mg PO QD (Vem/Cobi; N= 246) or a matched placebo (Vem/Placebo; N=247). Cobimetinib/Placebo was administered on Days 1-21 of each 28 day cycle (i.e., with 7 days off therapy).</p></div>

The median duration of exposure to vemurafenib was 279 days (range 4-563 days) in the Vem/Cobi treatment group and 175 days (range 5-516 days) in the Vem/Placebo arm. The most common reason for treatment discontinuation in both study arms was disease progression. Forty-five percent of Vem/Cobi treated patients and 35% of Vem/Placebo treated patients required a dose modification or interruption during treatment due to an adverse event. The AEs which most commonly resulted in a reduction/interruption of cobimetinib/placebo were: gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhea: 9% vs. 4%; vomiting: 6% vs. 5%; and nausea: 5% vs. 4%), rash (rash, unspecified: 5% vs. 6%; and rash, maculo-papular: 5% vs. 4%), pyrexia (6% vs. 3%), increased blood CPK (5% vs. 1%), and chorioretinopathy (7% vs. 0%).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment of Data Quality for Safety Analysis in GO28141</head><p>As noted in section 3.1, the overall quality of the submission was judged to be adequate for review. The Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) datasets (i.e., raw datasets) were used as sources for the analysis datasets. The following data cutoff dates were agreed to during the pre-submission negotiations: The FDA clinical review of safety included an audit of AE case report forms as well as an assessment of the coding of AE verbatim terms to MedDRA preferred terms (PT) to assess the completeness and verify the accuracy of the raw AE datasets. In an audit of 5% of the GO28141 trial population, minor differences between the information captured on the case report forms and that included in the AE datasets. These were primarily due to the occurrence of the event after the data cutoff date of May 9, 2014. In addition, the review audit included an assessment of the Applicant's mapping of AE verbatim terms to MedDRA PTs for all 3314 verbatim terms in the GO28141 raw AE dataset. A manual assessment of 371 verbatim terms which could not be matched to MedDRA preferred terms was conducted. This manual assessment revealed that the MedDRA preferred terms captured in the analysis datasets adequately represent the verbatim terms in the case report forms in nearly all cases</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Analysis Population in GO28141</head><p>As detailed in Section 3.1 of this review, in the original NDA submission, Genentech reported that 10 patients in the ITT study population did not receive the randomized treatment. Two patients, one in each treatment group, received no study treatment.</p><p>Eight patients randomized to receive Vem/Placebo were identified as having received one or more doses of cobimetinib and were therefore included in the Vem/Cobi group for the safety analysis. These patients were enrolled at seven different study sites. At the time of the 90-day Safety update, Genentech reported that as a result of further onsite monitoring and drug kit reconciliation at the time of the data lock, it was subsequently determined only one of these eight patients did, in fact, receive cobimetinib. This exposure resulted from a drug dosing error. This patient remained with the Vem/Cobi group for the safety analysis. In the remaining seven patients errors in data transcription resulted in an incorrect test kit number being entered into the electronic case report form. None of these seven patients received cobimetinib. For the safety analysis, these misclassified patients were returned to the Vem/Placebo group. In a May 22, 2015 response to FDA's information request dated May 19, 2015, Genentech further reported that an additional 11 patients randomized to receive Vem/Cobi had received one or more doses of placebo. As a result of further site monitoring and drug kit reconciliation at the time of the data lock, it was subsequently determined that four of these patients had received placebo due to a pharmacy error. However, since these four patients had also received one or more doses of cobimetinib, these four patients remained in the Vem/Cobi group for the safety analysis. The misclassification of the remaining seven patients resulted from a transcription error of the test kit number into the electronic case report form. None of these patients had actually received placebo. As a result, they remained classified with the Vem/Cobi group for the safety analysis. The reclassification of these patients is summarized in <ref type="figure">Figure 19</ref> below. FDA requested that Genentech submit the data sets used to generate the 90-day Safety Update report (90D Safety Update) in order to verify that data in the original submission had not undergone substantial change after the data lock in response to data queries.</p><p>On June 15, 2015, Genentech submitted an amendment to the NDA (NDA 206192/0036) which contained the following analysis datasets used to generate the 90-D Safety Update: adae.xpt, adeg.xpt, adex.xpt, adlb.xpt, adlv.xpt, and adsl.xpt as well as the corresponding SDTM datasets. It is noted that updates were not provided for all datasets in the original submission. Based on a comparison between the original datasets and the datasets used to generate the 90-D Safety Update, the FDA reviewer was able to: 1) verify that there were no systematic changes made to data in the 90-D Safety Update and 2) verify the Applicant's claim that changes in group assignment at the time of the 90-D Safety Update did not materially change the reported safety findings.</p><p>Reviewer comment: Submission of the SDTM and ADaM datasets for verification of data in the 90D Safety Update was considered a major amendment to this application and the goal date was extended by three months to provide time for a full review of the submission. The revised goal date was extended to <ref type="bibr">November 11, 2015.</ref> Since the 90-D Safety Update provided approximately 3 months of additional follow-up for this relatively small safety population which was felt to be advantageous, FDA decided to base the safety evaluation on the data from the 90D Safety Update, where data was available, and to incorporate this data into labeling. The 90D safety update increased the median durations of exposure to both cobimetinib and vemurafenib by approximately 90 days in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib group and by 20 days in the placebo plus vemurafenib group. The number of patients in the intent-to-treat population, the safety population and in the EKG evaluable analysis population is shown in below.  </p></div>

These are shown below. • Vem/Placebo: One patient originally classed as having Grade 5 Fatigue was reclassified as having progressive disease. One new Grade 5 adverse event of atelectasis was reported (patient 2400). The total number of patient deaths due to Grade 5 AEs in the Vem/Placebo group remained constant at 3 patients.</p><p>• Vem/Cobi: Three patients previously reported to have Grade 5 adverse events (2447: asthenia and fatigue, 2107: hemiparesis, and 2335: cerebral hemorrhage were re-assessed. In patient 2447, the cause of death was originally reported as "Other". Upon review, the two Grade 5 adverse events for patient 2447 were reclassified as Grade 3 asthenia and Grade 2 fatigue and not as reportable Grade 5 adverse events. The cause of death in this patient was assessed as likely related to disease progression. The cause of death for patients 2107 and 2335 were also reclassified as PD and not as reportable Grade 5 adverse events. At the time of the safety update, two new patients were reported to have experienced Grade 5 AEs (2376: coma and 2118: clostridium difficile colitis).

The patient developed a Grade 3 retinal detachment on Study Day 5 which was confirmed by an ophthalmological exam. On this day, treatment with cobimetinib was permanently discontinued due to this event. Due to ongoing and worsening ocular findings, treatment with vemurafenib was discontinued on study day 47. No post-baseline assessments were performed. On study day 141, the patient was reported to have died possibly due to a cerebral hemorrhage. No autopsy was performed and no further details were provided. The cause of death was attributed to disease progression. Reviewer's assessment: While the contribution of cobimetinib to the presumed event of cerebral hemorrhage cannot be ruled out, the onset of the event and subsequent death 136 days following the discontinuation of cobimetinib makes a causal association less likely. These 5 patients are further described in the narrative summaries below. The patient's baseline LVEF as assessed by ECHO was 50%.

Liver function elevations and rash most commonly led to study drug discontinuation among patients treated with Vem/Placebo <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">(Table 42)</ref>.  The percentage of patients requiring a dosing modification or dosing interruption of one or both study drugs was higher among patients receiving Vem/Cobi than for patients receiving Vem/Placebo <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">(Table 43)</ref>.  The most common AEs that resulted in dose interruption or reduction of cobimetinib in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm, compared with the placebo plus vemurafenib arm, were diarrhea (9% vs. 4%), chorioretinopathy (7% vs. 0%), pyrexia (6% vs. 3%), vomiting (6% vs. 5%), nausea (5% vs. 4%), increased blood CPK (5% vs. 1%), rash (5% vs. 6%; and rash maculo-papular (5% vs. 4%).</p></div>

As 43% of patients with serous retinopathy/RPED had events that were ongoing at the time of the data cutoff date, there is insufficient information to assess whether this event is reversible.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Visual Disturbances:</head><p>The median time of onset of visual disturbances among the 73 (30%) patients treated with Vem/Placebo was 43 days (range: 2 to 382 days); the median time to onset of visual disturbances among the 93 (38%) patients treated with Vem/Cobi was 36 days Clinical Review Ruthann M. Giusti NDA 206192 Cobimetinib in combination with Vemurafenib 135 (range: 1 to 482 days). The cumulative per-patient incidence of visual disturbances by study day of onset and treatment group is shown below. Reviewer's comment: The reduction in incidence and the delayed occurrence of cusCC/KA observed with the addition of cobimetinib to vemurafenib therapy are similar to that seen with the addition the MEK-inhibitor, trametinib to BRAF-inhibitor therapy with dabrafenib. This decrease has been attributed to blockade of the paradoxical increase in signaling downstream of BRAF. In contrast to cusCC, basal cell carcinomas were reported more commonly among patients in the Vem/Cobi treatment group than among patients in the Vem/Placebo treatment group. The median time of onset of basal cell carcinoma among the 6 (2%) patients treated with Vem/Placebo was 123 days (range: 14 to 355 days); the median time to onset of basal cell carcinoma among the 11 (4%) patients treated with Vem/Cobi was 115 days (range: 27 to 379 days). The cumulative per-patient incidence of basal cell carcinoma by study day of onset and treatment group is shown below. Patients with new primary melanoma were identified as those having events in the MedDRA higher level group term (HLGT) Skin Neoplasms Malignant and Unspecified. Among the patients in this category, all patients with melanoma-related MedDRA primary terms (PT) were selected. These included the following PT: malignant melanoma (n=4), malignant melanoma in situ (n=3) and metastatic malignant melanoma (n=1). While the number of events was small in both groups, melanoma related PTs appeared to be less commonly reported among patients treated in the Vem/Cobi group and appeared to be reported later than among patients in the Vem/Placebo treatment group. The median time of onset among the 6 (2%) patients treated with Vem/Placebo was 88 days (range: 27 to 205 days). Two (1%) patients treated with Vem/Cobi were diagnosed with second primary melanoma, one at 216 days and one at 350 days. The cumulative per-patient incidence of by study day of onset and treatment group is shown below. Skin neoplasms malignant and unspecified. Ten tumors were identified in ten patients treated with Vem/Placebo and three tumors were identified in two patients treated with Vem/Cobi. The line listing of second primary malignancies diagnosed in patients treated on GO28141 by study arm is shown below. The median time of onset of second non-cutaneous malignancy among the 10 tumors diagnosed in 10 patients treated with Vem/Placebo was 112 days (range: 26 to 410 days). Two patients in the Vem/Cobi arm were diagnosed with three second noncutaneous malignancies between 170 and 395 days. Second primary non-cutaneous tumors appeared to be diagnosed less frequently and later in the Vem/Cobi treatment group than in the Vem/Placebo treatment group. Reviewer's comment: While screening for SCC of the head and neck at baseline was fairly complete, many patients were missing the protocol specified end of study screening for anal and gynecologic cancers. The reported number of these tumors may be underestimates based on incomplete screening. While numbers are sparse, it appears that the number of second primary tumors is decreased and the onset may be delayed with the addition of cobimetinib to vemurafenib. For purposes of this analysis rash (acneiform and non-acneiform rash) included the following MedDRA PTs: The rate and time to first occurrence of rash (Grade ≥ 3) was similar in the two treatment groups. The median time of onset of rash among the 39 (16%) patients treated with Vem/Placebo was 11 days (range: 2 to 140 days); the median time to onset of rash among the 40 (16%) patients treated with Vem/Cobi was 15 days (range: 3 to 145 days). The cumulative per-patient incidence of rash (Grade ≥ 3) by study day of onset and treatment group is shown below.  Ten (4%) Vem/Cobi treated patients required hospitalization for a skin adverse event. In two patients, the hospitalization was thought to be related to a skin infection; in the remaining 8 patients, drug reaction was suspect. One of these cases was diagnosed as DRESS and one case was thought to be early Steven Johnson Syndrome.</p></div>

Baseline screening for magnesium level and creatinine phosphokinase was less complete (94% and 89%, respectively. For purposes of the analysis of laboratory findings below, the denominator was assumed to be the denominator of the safety population. If a baseline laboratory value was missing, it was assigned a normal at baseline (NCICTCAE Grade =0). Of note, numbers of patients with laboratory adverse events reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_22">Table 54</ref> are based on the CTCAE grade as derived from actual lab values reported in the analysis laboratory data file adlb.xpt and may differ from the numbers of patients reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_23">Table 50which</ref> is derived from events reported on the case report form and captured in the adverse event analysis file adae.xpt.</p><p>The number of patients with laboratory abnormalities worsening from baseline is shown below in <ref type="table" target="#tab_22">Table 54</ref>. Hepatotoxicity is labeled under Warnings and Precautions in the current USPI for vemurafenib. Liver function test abnormalities were common in patients treated with Vem/Placebo. However, the incidence and severity of LFT elevations increased with the addition of cobimetinib (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_23">Table 56</ref> through 59 below).  Elevations in excess of 5xULN and 10xULN were noted in the Vem/Cobi treatment arm compared to the Vem/Placebo arm for both ALT and AST. Elevations in total bilirubin of greater than 2xULN occurred more commonly among patients treated with Vem/Placebo than among patients treated with Vem/Cobi <ref type="table" target="#tab_23">(Table 58)</ref>. The incidence of ALP elevations was higher among patients treated with Vem/Cobi than with Vem/Placebo; however a large percentage of patients with elevations fell into the category of ALP elevations ≤ 3xULN which suggests non-specific hepatic injury and is less likely predictive of obstruction. One patient in the Vem/Placebo arm and three patients in the Vem/Cobi arm were identified as having met the following enzyme criteria: ALT &gt; 3xULN; BILI &gt;2xULN; ALP &lt;2xULN and were identified as potential Hy's Law cases. The scatter gram for patients meeting the above criteria is shown below. Reviewer's comment: This reviewer assesses at least one case meeting the criteria of Hy's Law. A second case potentially meets Hy's Law criteria. The interpretation of this case is confounded by concomitant medications known rarely to cause hepatotoxicity. A positive dechallenge with the discontinuation of cobimetinib in this second case suggests the potential for drug-drug interaction at minimum. The identification of these cases along with the pattern of AST/ALT elevations noted in excess among patients treated in the Vem/Cobi treatment group suggests that hepatotoxicity may me increased with the addition of cobimetinib. The reviewer recommends that hepatotoxicity be included in the Warnings and Precaution section of the label. The potential for drug-drug interactions should be monitored in the post-marketing setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4.3">Vital Signs</head><p>A series of exploratory analyses were conducted to assess trends in changes in vital signs over time by treatment group. The tables below display the linear regression with confidence intervals. There was a suggestion of a decrease in respiratory rate, an increase in pulse rate, and a decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the Vem/Cobi group relative to the Vem/Placebo group over time. An increase in mean temperature and weight were noted in the Vem/Cobi group relative to the Vem/Placebo group over time. Reviewer's comment: It is interesting to note that while, overall, there was a trend towards decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure and increased pulse rate among patients in the Vem/Cobi treatment group, which may be related to volume depletion given the high percentage of patients on the Vem/Cobi arm who experienced diarrhea, hypertension was reported as an adverse event more frequently in the Vem/Cobi arm as well <ref type="table" target="#tab_23">(Table 50</ref>). Pyrexia as an adverse event (all Grades) was reported in 56 (23%) of patients treated with Vem/Placebo and in 69(28%) of patients treated with Vem/Cobi. Grade 3-4 pyrexia was reported in 0(0%) of patients treated with Vem/Placebo and in 4(2%) of patients treated with Vem/Cobi. Pyrexia was reported to be the cause of treatment discontinuation in 0(0%) of patients treated with Vem/Placebo and in 3(1%) of patients treated with Vem/Cobi and resulted in hospitalization in 2 (1%) of patients treated with Vem/Placebo and in 7(3%) of patients treated with Vem/Cobi. However, these fevers were not commonly associated with hypotension, rigors or chills. In two cases, fevers were associated with an underlying infection, in one case with a vasculitis, in one case with myalgias and in one case with a dermatitis. ECG monitoring was done with triplicate studies at baseline using the Frederica adjustment (QTcF), on D15 Cycles 1, 2, and 3 and on D1 of subsequent cycles. There was no difference between treatment groups in the mean of the highest QTcF interval observed on treatment. This finding is consistent with the assessment of the Clinical Pharmacology QTIRC team (please see their review for details). However, 6 (2%) patients in the Vem/Placebo group compared to 12 (5%) patients in the Vem/Cobi group were identified as having a QTcF ≥ 500 msec or a change of ≥ 60 msec over baseline. There also appeared to be a trend towards an increase in the change in QTcF over baseline values in the Vem/Cobi treatment group.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4.5">Special Safety Studies/Clinical Trials</head><p>To assess the risk of left ventricular dysfunction associated with the combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib, Left ventricular function (LVEF) was assessed by ECHO or MUGA at baseline, on C2D1, C5D1 and every 2 cycles thereafter. The same method was used to assess LVEF for an individual patient over the course of the study. Per the clinical protocol, modifications were made to the dose of cobimetinib for a symptomatic decrease in LVEF or symptomatic heart failure. For an episode meeting these criteria, cobimetinib was held or was discontinued at the investigator's discretion. Vemurafenib could be continued. If cardiac symptoms resolved completely within 28 days and LVEF returned to LLN, cobimetinib could be reintroduced with a reduction of 1 dosing level. The LVEF was to be monitored at two, four and six weeks after reintroduction of cobimetinib and then every six weeks for 12 weeks then per protocol. Following reintroduction of cobimetinib, if symptoms persisted or LVEF was below the LLN, cobimetinib was to be discontinued.</p><p>Events of LV dysfunction, if based on an assessment of LFEV were coded within the MedDRA Investigations Systems Organ Class (SOC). If based on a clinical assessment, such events could be classified under the MedDRA Cardiac Disorders SOC with a primary term of left ventricular dysfunction, cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy or congestive cardiomyopathy. Based on an analysis of data reported in the adverse events dataset (adae.xpt), nine (4%) patients in the Vem/Placebo treatment group and 21 (9%) patients in the Vem/Cobi treatment group experienced a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction of CTCAE Grade ≥ 2 (defined as resting ejection fraction 50-40%; 10-19% drop from baseline).   <ref type="table" target="#tab_22">Table 64</ref>. Of these ten patients, six had underlying cardiac risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, ischemic heart disease and mitral valve prolapse). In three patients, the decline in LVEF was in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction. In one of these cases, the event was fatal. Two of these patients were of advanced age with significant cardiac risk factors. The third patient, a 51 year old female with no prior cardiac history was confirmed to have coronary artery occlusion and was treated with stent placement. In this patient, LV dysfunction was attributed to the coronary event.</p><p>Of the remaining seven patients, cobimetinib was permanently discontinued due to the reduction in LVEF in one patient (a 30-year-old male with a 25% decrease in LVEF from baseline). Cobimetinib was interrupted and/or reduced in four patients and was continued in 2 patients.</p><p>A follow-up LVEF was available on 8 of the nine surviving patients.

Relevant findings are further explored and discussed the in the body of the review.  An exploratory MAED analysis by MedDRA Higher Level Group Terms (HLGT) is shown below in <ref type="table" target="#tab_30">Table 70</ref>. Three HLGTs, Electrolyte and fluid balance conditions, Angioedema and urticarial and Bone, calcium, magnesium and phosphorus metabolism disorders represent potentially new safety signals and are discussed below.</p><p>PTs included in the Electrolyte and fluid balance conditions HLGT include dehydration, hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, and hyponatremia. Dehydration is likely related to the increased incidence of diarrhea among patients treated with Vem/Cobi and does not represent a new safety signal. Laboratory abnormalities are further explored in Section 7.4.2 below. Events classed in the Bone, calcium, magnesium and phosphorus metabolism disorders HLGT represent laboratory abnormalities and are also discussed in Section 7.4.2 below. In the Angioedema and urticarial HLGT, three patients in each treatment group were reported to have had the PT "Swelling, face", eight patients in the Vem/Cobi treatment group were reported to have had urticarial and one to have had angioedema. Three events, all urticarial were reported to have a CTCAE grade of 3; only one event was assessed as serious.</p><p>This patient (GO28141-252958-2184) was reported to have developed a macular rash over 30 % of this body and was treated with phenergan and prednisone. A Biopsy of two skin areas were taken and the rash was assessed to be consistent with urticarial and not erythema multiforme. Vemurafenib was discontinued. Cobimetinib was not discontinued. The other two events (GO28141-256298-2301 and GO28141-2558383-2172), were assessed as Grade 3 events, but non-serious. These events were attributed to vemurafenib and reported as resolved without discontinuation of cobimetinib therapy. The remaining patient (GO28141-252961-2396) was reported to have Grade 2 angioedema (Quickne's Edema) with a prior event reported as a Grade 2 drug eruption. The event was attributed to vemurafenib, cobimetinib was continued and the event was reported as ongoing.</p><p>Reviewer's comment: The signal of angioedema/urticarial was not a strong one. In only one case was the event considered to be serious. In all cases, the event was attributed to vemurafenib. It is possible that cobimetinib was contributory or independently associated with the event. In any case, this reviewer concludes that this potential flag should be monitored through post-market surveillance and that the level of risk does not justify inclusion as a warning at the present time.    In addition to the previously noted flag for cerebrovascular disorders, exploration of SMQ (Narrow) terms suggested a possible increase in the risk of hemorrhagic events and hyperglycemia. The per-patient incidence of hemorrhagic events in the GO28141 is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 53</ref>. While the incidence of hemorrhagic events was increased in the Vem/Cobi treatment group compared to the Vem/Placebo treatment group, most events were assessed as CTCAE Grade 1 or 2. One Grade 5 event of cerebral hemorrhage was reported in the Vem/Cobi treatment group but this was assessed as related to the underlying disease. </p></div>

In keeping with the Agency's stated desire to review serial OCT scans (baseline and on-study), the Sponsor is prioritizing serial OCT scan collection from sites who participated in the NO25395 and GO28141 studies who are able to provide source OCT imaging files and reports in English in time for the planned March 11th submission.</p><p>The Sponsor has conducted a thorough and robust site-by-site feasibility assessment and anticipates that serial OCT imaging studies will be available and provided for evaluation from approximately 55 melanoma patients treated on Studies NO25395 and GO28141. This represents a total of approximately 150 scans and reports that would be collected from these patients. Since sites remain blinded to study treatment, the current approximation is that 40 of the 55 patients are anticipated to have been treated with cobimetinib and vemurafenib. The Sponsor believes that providing high quality, serial assessments, albeit from a subset of patients, will provide the FDA with the information they have requested for their assessment.</p><p>OCT scans and associated reports will be collated, de-identified and uploaded by ophthalmologists who evaluated patients on study to a validated central repository. The Sponsor has engaged the services of The Digital Angiography Reading Center (DARC) to operationalize and manage the central repository, in part since the Sponsor understands that the ophthalmic branch of the Agency has worked with DARC previously and the Sponsor hopes this will help facilitate the Agency's review. FDA reviewers will be able to access and read the OCT scans through direct access to the central repository using a secure VPN connection provided by DARC.</p><p>In addition, the Sponsor will provide a brief report summarizing the imaging findings. This report will be provided to the FDA by <ref type="bibr">March 11, 2014</ref> in conjunction with the planned NDA Safety Update. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>March 10, 2015 Submission</head><p>The Sponsor retrospectively collected serial OCT scans and reports from selected study sites who were able to provide raw imaging files that enrolled patients to studies NO25395 and GO28141, regardless of whether the patient had an on-study serous retinopathy event. The image files and associated study ophthalmic reports were collated, de-identified and uploaded directly into a secure central repository operated and managed by an ophthalmology reading center with expertise in evaluation of OCT scans -The Digital Angiography Reading Center (DARC). This reading center has been used by Genentech for prior ophthalmology sponsored trials. All OCT scans received were reviewed by qualified personnel at the reading center. The review focused on evaluating the clinical characteristics of abnormal fluid accumulation on OCT scans and quantitative analysis of central foveal thickness over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comment:</head><p>The applicant should have prospectively planned to collect OCT images and analyze them.</p><p>The study protocols did not specifically require collection of ophthalmic images. Therefore, the source file formats of this retrospective collection of images and reports were specific to each site and could not be standardized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comment:</head><p>The drug's potential to cause serious detachments was known prior to the initiation of the study. The protocols should have required the collection and analysis of the ophthalmic images.</p><p>The Sponsor focused on collecting sets of imaging studies and reports that could meet the agreed upon timelines (by <ref type="bibr">March 11, 2015</ref> to coincide with the submission of the NDA Safety Update). As anticipated, due to the country-and site-level feasibility challenges of retrospective scan collection, and as previously discussed with the FDA, the size of this archive is a modest but representative subset of the clinical studies supporting the NDA. In addition, given the added complexities and time required in translating non-English reports, study sites with reports available in English were also prioritized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comment:</head><p>The images are not language specific. Non-English reports should also have been collected.</p><p>Best-corrected visual acuity results were converted to logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) in order to facilitate statistical manipulation.</p><p>Serial OCT scans, defined as baseline plus at least one on-treatment scan, were retrospectively collected from 47 patients in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Serial OCTs were obtained from 35 patients (74%) in Study GO28141 and 12 patients (26%) in Study NO25395. In total, 35/47 patients (74%) were treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib in studies GO28141 and NO25395 and 12 patients were treated with vemurafenib plus placebo in study GO28141.   Has the application submitted a rationale for assuming the applicability of foreign data to U.S. population/practice of medicine in the submission? X 6% of participants in GO28141 were enrolled in the US. SAFETY 21. Has the applicant presented the safety data in a manner consistent with Center guidelines and/or in a manner previously requested by the Division? X 22. Has the applicant submitted adequate information to assess the arythmogenic potential of the product (e.g., QT interval studies, if needed)? X 23. Has the applicant presented a safety assessment based on all current worldwide knowledge regarding this product? X 24. For chronically administered drugs, have an adequate number of patients (based on ICH guidelines for exposure 1 ) been exposed at the dose (or dose range) believed to be efficacious? X 25. For drugs not chronically administered (intermittent or short course), have the requisite number of patients been exposed as requested by the Division? X 26. Has the applicant submitted the coding dictionary 2 used for mapping investigator verbatim terms to preferred terms? X 1 For chronically administered drugs, the ICH guidelines recommend 1500 patients overall, 300-600 patients for six months, and 100 patients for one year. These exposures MUST occur at the dose or dose range believed to be efficacious. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">2</ref> The "coding dictionary" consists of a list of all investigator verbatim terms and the preferred terms to which they were mapped. It is most helpful if this comes in as a SAS transport file so that it can be sorted as needed; however, if it is submitted as a PDF document, it should be submitted in both directions (verbatim -&gt; preferred and preferred -&gt; verbatim).  </p></div>

Cutaneous Malignancies: A lower rate of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cusCC)/kerataoacanthoma (KA) (6% and 19%) and of second primary melanoma (1% and 2%) were seen among patients treated with Vem/Cobi compared to patients treated with Vem/Placebo. A higher rate of basal cellHemorrhage: The incidence of hemorrhage (all grades) was 10% in patients receiving Vem/Cobi and was 6% in patients receiving Vem/Placebo. Grade 3-5 hemorrhages occurred in 1% of patients receiving Vem/Cobi and in 0.4% of patients receiving Vem/Placebo. Cerebral hemorrhage occurred in 1% of patients receiving Vem/Cobi and in none of the patients receiving Vem/Placebo. GI tract hemorrhage (3% vs 1%), reproductive system hemorrhage (2% vs 1%), and hematuria (2% vs 1%) also occurred at a higher incidence in patients receiving Vem/Cobi compared to patients receiving Vem/Placebo. However, there were no CTCAE Grade 4 or 5 hemorrhagic events in either arm.Reviewer's comment: While hemorrhage may be an emerging signal, this reviewer does not feel that there is sufficient evidence at the present time to include this event in the Warnings and Precautions section of the USPI. This event should be monitored as part of routine post-marketing surveillance.Cardiomyopathy: Decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of Grade 2 or 3 detected by serial assessment using ECHO/MUGA was reported in 64 (26%) patients receiving Vem/Cobi and in 47 (19%) patients receiving Vem/Placebo. No Grade 4 or 5 events were reported. Median time to first onset of LVEF decrease was 4 months (range 1 to 7 months) in patients receiving Vem/Cobi. Two patients with symptomatic LVEF decrease required permanent discontinuation of cobimetinib; the remaining patients required dosing interruption or decrease.patients treated with Vem/Placebo. Photosensitivity reactions (46% vs. 35%) and acneiform dermatitis (16% vs. 11%) were more common among patients in the Vem/Cobi treatment group. Rash (rash, unspecified, generalized, macular, maculo- papular and morbilliform) (55% vs. 53%), pruritis (19% vs. 19%), and erythema (10%Hepatotoxicity: The incidences of Grade 3 or 4 liver test abnormalities among patients receiving Vem/Cobi compared to patients receiving Vem/Placebo were: alanine aminotransferase (11% vs. 6%), aspartate aminotransferase (7% vs 3%), total bilirubin (2% vs. 1%) and alkaline phosphatase (7% vs 3). One patient treated with Vem/Cobi met Hy's Law criteria. One additional patient met the criteria for Hy's Law but interpretation of the event was confounded by concomitant medications rarely causing hepatotoxicity. Serum Creatinine Kinase (CK) Elevations/Musculoskeletal Adverse Reactions: CK elevation over baseline occurred in 59% of patients treated with Vem/Cobi and in 9% of patients treated with Vem/Placebo and Grade 3-4 CK elevation over baseline occurred in 10% of patients treated with Vem/Cobi and in &lt;1% of patients treated with Vem/Placebo. Rhabdomyolysis (defined as serum CK increase of more than 10 times the baseline value with a concurrent 1.5 -fold or greater increase in serum creatinine above baseline value) occurred in eight (3%) patients treated with Vem/Cobi and in one (&lt;1%) patient treated with Vem/Placebo. Two additional patients (one in each treatment arm) were reported to have rhabdomyolysis but did not meet this definition. However, musculoskeletal adverse reactions occurred less frequently among patients treated with Vem/Cobi than among patients treated with Vem/Placebo (All Grades: 51% vs. 61%; Grade 3-4 6% vs.10%) and resulted in hospitalization in 2% of patients in each study arm. Arthralgias (36% vs. 40%), myalgias (11% vs. 12%), and extremity pain (10% vs. 14%) occurred less commonly among patients treated with Vem/Cobi than with Vem/Placebo.Reviewer's comment: While the incidence of Grade 3-4 CK elevation among patients in the Vem/Cobi treatment group was high and while a number of patients met the laboratory definition of rhabdomyolysis, these events did not appear to correlate with musculoskeletal symptoms. Nonetheless, given the relatively safety database, this reviewer advocates inclusion of this event in the Warnings and Precaution, along with routine post-marketing surveillance.</note></figure>

The GO28141 trial demonstrated a statistically significant 50% improvement in investigator assessed progression-free survival in patients randomized to receive the Vem/Placebo arm. Pre-specified secondary endpoints included progression-free survival as assessed by a blinded independent radiology committee (BIRC), overall survival (OS) and BIRC-confirmed overall response rate (ORR). PFS analysis based on BIRC review showed results consistent with the primary analysis [HR: 0.60 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.79); p&lt;0.001)] and all secondary analyses showed consistent results across relevant subgroups. A statistically significant improvement in OS was observed for patients randomized to receive Vem/Cobi compared to those randomized to receive Vem/Placebo [HR: 0.63 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.85); stratified log-rank p-value=0.0019 is less than the nominal significance level of 0.019 based on the interim analysis]. The estimated median OS for patients randomized to receive Vem/Cobi was not reached (NR) at the time of the analysis (95% CI: 20.7, NR) and was 17.0 months (95% CI: 15.0, NR) for patients randomized to receive Vem/Placebo. The BICRconfirmed ORR per RECIST v1.1 was significantly improved in patients randomized to receive Vem/Cobi compared to patients randomized to receive Vem/Placebo [67% (95% CI: 61%, 73%) vs. 45% (95% CI: 39%, 51%); Chi-Square test p-value &lt;0.0001)]. Complete responses were reported in 10% of patients randomized to receive Vem/Cobi and in 5% of patients randomized to receive Vem/Placebo. The median duration of response among responders in the Vem/Cobi arm was not reached (NR) at the time of the analysis (range: 9.3, NA) and was 7.3 months (range: 5.8, NR) among responders in the Vem/Cobi arm. Responses lasting at least 6 months were seen in 25% of responders randomized to the Vem/Cobi arm and in 20% of responders randomized to the Vem/Placebo arm An exploratory analyses of PFS and OS to assess the treatment effect by BRAF mutation subset (V600E and V600K retrospectively classified using Next Gen sequencing in patients pre-screened for study entry using the cobas ® test) was conducted in 81% of patients in the ITT study population who had adequate tissue remaining for analysis. Three hundred forty-four patients (Vem/Cobi: n=170; Vem/Placebo: n=172) were identified as having BRAF V600E mutations and fifty-six (Vem/Cobi: n=16; Vem/Placebo: n=10). This analysis suggested a similar treatment effect on PFS in both mutation subtypes with no apparent decrement in OS [BRAF V600E: PFS: HR=0.56; 95%CI: 0.40, 0.79; OS: HR=0.76; 95% CI: 0.45, 1.26; BRAF V600K: PFS: HR: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.81; OS: HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.16, 2.37]. Among patients with BRAF V600E mutations, confirmed objective responses were seen in 116 (68%) patients randomized to receive Vem/Cobi and in 83 (48%) patients randomized to receive Vem/Placebo. Among patients with BRAF V600K mutations, confirmed objective responses were seen in 16 (67%) patients randomized to receive Vem/Cobi and in 10 (31%) patients randomized to receive Vem/Placebo.In summary, the GO28141 trial, the single randomized trial supporting efficacy in this NDA, demonstrated a robust, statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in PFS, OS, and ORR with consistency across all secondary endpoints and relevant subgroups with the addition of cobimetinib to vemurafenib therapy.

However, since the median values are closer, the mean is likely skewed by outlying values. The time from diagnosis of metastatic disease would have been a more relevant comparison. However this data was not collected.Documentation of BRAFV600 mutation-positive melanoma in tumor tissue (archival or newly obtained) using the cobas ® 4800 BRAF V600 mutation test was required for study entry. Testing could be performed at a local lab or at the central lab. Archival or newly obtained tumor specimens could be used for BRAF mutation testing. When a local lab BRAF mutation test results was used to determine eligibility, documentation confirming the result and use of the cobas ® test was required. Patients in whom BRAF mutation status as assessed by the cobas test was not centrally verified were excluded from the analysis. If sufficient DNA remained, samples were retrospectively tested to further characterize the BRAF mutation subtype using Next Gen sequencing.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Vem/Placebo</cell><cell>Vem/Cobi</cell></row><row><cell>(n=248)</cell><cell>(n=247)</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

OnOctober 8, 2015, FDA held an informal teleconference with Genentech to discuss the results of the updated analyses. The GO2811 efficacy update and supporting datasets with a data cutoff date ofJanuary 16, 2015  were submitted to the NDA on October 13, 2015. FDA's verification of this data (using IxRS) indicates that the efficacy boundary for the O'Brien-Flemming boundary for OS was crossed. Since the study met its primary endpoint, and pursuant to the agreement made at the pre-NDA meeting, the FDA statistical team recommends inclusion of data from the second interim OS analysis in final labeling. The second interim analysis demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival among patients randomized to receive Vem/Cobi compared to patients randomized to receive Vem/Placebo. The median OS for the Vem/Cobi treatment arm was not reached at the time of the second interim analysis. Please see the addendum to Dr. Jiang's statistical review for additional details.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Clinical Review</cell></row><row><cell>Ruthann M.

On (Study Day 162), he was discharged from the hospital. The investigator considered diabetes mellitus to be unrelated to the vemurafenib and cobimetinib. Betamethasone sodium phosphate and unspecified treatment drugs was a possible etiological factor for the event.Reviewer's comment: Both Hemorrhage and hyperglycemia are listed in the Warnings and Precautions section of the MEKINIST label and may represent class effects and a Warning should be considered for Hemorrhagic events in the COTELLIC label. Hemorrhagic events occurring among patients treated with Vem/Cobi were generally low grade. Hyperglycemia is labeled in the vemurafenib label. Routine monitoring for hyperglycemia was not conducted in the GO28141 and the number of events captured in the Hyperglycemia SMQ (Narrow) is small.At present while it is unclear whether the risk of hyperglycemia is increased when cobimetinib is used in combination with vemurafenib. This event should be monitored in the post-marketing setting.</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="2">Clinical Review</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Ruthann M.

Five HLTs represent potentially new safety flags and are discussed below. Primary terms included in the apocrine and endocrine gland disorders HLT included the MedDRA lower level terms "night sweats", "sweating, diaphoresis, hyperhidrosis, hidradentis and milia. These terms likely represent terms captured by the primary terms "pyrexia" and under rash and thus were not thought to represent a new safety signal. PTs captured under the vascular hypertensive disorders, NEC HLT were hypertension and prehypertension. These did not represent new safety signals. Nine of the ten patients captured under the Pneumothorax and pleural effusions NEC HTL had pleural effusions and one had a pneumothorax. These represented tumor-related events and were not felt to represent new safety signals. Patients within the Stomatitis and ulceration HLT had the following PTs: apthous stomatitis, mouth ulceration, oral mucosa erosion and stomatitis. These PTs represent different names for a common event and so should be grouped together and included for labeling purposes as this event meets the criteria for inclusion intoTable.Six patients were reported to have had events in the Central nervous system hemorrhages and cerebrovascular accidents HLT. All of these patients received treatment with Vem/Cobi. Adverse event terms included cerebrovascular accident (n=3), cerebral vascular accident (n=2), subarachnoid hemorrhage (n=1), and ischemic stroke (n=1). The date of onset of these events ranged from 22 days to 376 days. In four events, the underlying cause was attributed to the disease under study. However, this distribution is unlikely to have occurred by chance alone (Χ 2 = 0.0; p&lt; .001).</figDesc><table><row><cell>Clinical Review</cell></row><row><cell>Ruthann M.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ocular Toxicities:</head><p>Ocular toxicities of special interest included retinal vein occlusion, serous retinopathy/retinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED) and other visual disturbances. These events were defined using the following lists of MedDRA preferred terms:  Serous retinopathy/RPED (all grades) and visual disturbances (≥ Grade 2 and not reported as either RVO or serous retinopathy) were reported with a higher incidence among patients treated with Vem/Cobi than among patients treated with Vem/Placebo. Only two patients (one in each treatment group) were reported to have had retinal vein occlusion.</p><p>Reviewer's comment: It is noteworthy that these events were not uniformly recorded over the course of the trial. Nor were retinal scans available for review and verification. The ophthalmology consult has noted the poor quality of the ophthalmologic data submitted in the application. Thus, the rate reported by the applicant cannot be confirmed by FDA. Please see the FDA ophthalmology consult review for further details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Serous Retinopathy/Retinal Pigment Epithelial Detachment (RPED):</head><p>Most events were Grade 1 or Grade 2. The median time of onset of serous retinopathy/RPED among the seven (3%) patients treated with Vem/Placebo was 31 days (range: 24 to 281 days); the median time to onset of serous retinopathy/RPED among 63 (26%) patients treated with Vem/Cobi was similar, 30 days (range: 2 to 282 Clinical Review Ruthann M. Giusti NDA 206192 Cobimetinib in combination with Vemurafenib 136 was common, occurring in 86 (35%) patients treated with Vem/Placebo and 112 (45%) patients treated with Vem/Cobi. The median time of onset of photosensitivity among the 86 patients treated with Vem/Placebo was 29 days (range: 2 to 393 days); the median time to onset of photosensitivity reactions among the 112 patients treated with Vem/Cobi was 63 days (range: 1 to 420 days). The cumulative per-patient incidence of photosensitivity reactions by study day of onset and treatment group is shown below. These adverse events of special interest are discussed in more detail in Section 7.4.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary Cutaneous Malignancies:</head><p>Primary cutaneous malignancies included primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and keratoacanthomas, basal cell carcinomas and second primary malignant melanomas. These events are discussed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cusCC) and Keratoacanthoma (KA):</head><p>Primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cusCC) and keratoacanthoma (KA) were reported at a much lower frequency among patients in the Vem/Cobi treatment group than in the Vem/Placebo treatment group. The median time of onset of cusCC/ KA malignancies among the 48 (19%) patients treated with Vem/Placebo was 57 days (range: 8 to 283 days); the median time to onset of cusCC/KA among the 14 (6%) patients treated with Vem/Cobi was 131 days (range: 57 to 344 days). The cumulative per-patient incidence of cusCC/KA by study day of onset and treatment group is shown below.  Musculoskeletal adverse events led to a dosing modification in 23 (9%) of patients treated with Vem/Placebo and in 12 (5%) of patients treated with Vem/Cobi. The median time to dose adjustment was 16 days (range 3 to 220 days) in patients treated with Vem/Placebo and 51 days (range: 11 to 33 days) in the 12 patients treated with Vem/Cobi. Musculoskeletal events were reported to be serious in 6 (2%) of patients in each treatment group and resulted in hospitalization in 5 (2%) of patients in each treatment group.</p><p>The most commonly reported primary terms for musculoskeletal adverse events are shown in the table below.  The five patients on the Vem/Cobi treatment group who met the above definition for Hy's Law are listed below:</p><p>The pattern of LFT elevation and the clinical narrative for these five patients were reviewed. Three of the above patients were felt to have patterns which were not suggestive of acute hepatic injury or narratives which suggested alternative explanations for the LFT elevations. The remaining two patients are discussed below. Treatment with vemurafenib and cobimetinib was not changed as result of the event of elevated GGT however; on 22-Nov-2013 (Study Day 47), treatment with vemurafenib and cobimetinib was permanently discontinued due to the events of elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, with the last doses of vemurafenib (960 mg) and cobimetinib (40 mg) administered on the same day <ref type="bibr">(22-Nov-2013)</ref>. Subsequently she entered the follow-up phase of the study. <ref type="bibr">On 18-Dec-2013 (Study Day 73)</ref>, an overall response assessment by CT scan showed disease progression with new lesions in the liver and skin (right lower leg). The investigator considered elevated alanine aminotransferase; elevated aspartate aminotransferase and elevated GGT to be related to vemurafenib and cobimetinib. This 68-year-old white female patient was randomized to study GO28141 on 27-Sep-2013 at a site in the Czech Republic. The patient was diagnosed with ″melanoma with exulceration″ on upper extremity in Dec-2010. At screening, the patient′s disease stage was M1c with an ECOG performance status was of 1. Previous diagnostic procedures and treatment for melanoma included immunotherapy with interferon from 06-Nov-2012 to <ref type="bibr">14-Nov-2012</ref>  Fever, defined as a temperature measurement of greater than or equal to a temperature of 37.5°C was reported in 25 (10%) of patients treated with Vem/Placebo and in 31 (13%) of patients treated with Vem/Cobi. The median value of temperature by day on study is shown below.  Reviewer comment: While pyrexia and fever were common in both treatment arms, there appears to be an increased incidence of pyrexia on the Vem/Cobi arm. The median temperature appears to be somewhat higher on the Vem/Cobi arm as well, an effect that does not appear to diminish over time. The rate of LVEF decrease was also assessed using serial data from the adlv.xpt dataset. Patients with less than a 10% decrement in ejection fraction from baseline were not included. CTCAE v. 4.02 were assigned as follows:   Reviewer's comment: Assessment of LV dysfunction based on the recorded LVEF resulted in additional cases being identified. This discrepancy in case reporting based on the method of ascertainment has been previously discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[29]</ref>. The reviewer recommends that data from the assessment of LVEF be included in labeling rather than the incidence reported in the adverse event file as this underestimates that actual incidence of LV dysfunction associated with cobimetinib.</p><p>The median time to onset of LV dysfunction was 108 days (range: 12 to 289 das) in patients treated with Vem/Placebo and 31 days (range 23 to 386 days) in patients treated with Vem/Cobi.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's comment: Cobimetinib does appear to increase the risk of LV dysfunction over that seen with vemurafenib alone. The risk of worsened LV dysfunction may be worse among patients with a history of cardiovascular disease or with other cardiac risk factors. LVEF appears to return towards baseline following dose discontinuation/interruption in most patients for whom a follow-up assessment was available. Genentech has proposed a warning for the use of cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib with this reviewer feels is appropriate.</head><p>Clinical Review Ruthann M.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.6.4">Overdose, Drug Abuse Potential, Withdrawal and Rebound</head><p>In the non-clinical studies, high-affinity binding to the agonist site of the mu opioid receptor was reported. Decreased respiratory rates were observed in dog studies. These combined observation led to the concern of the potential for withdrawal effects in humans (See FDA Non-Clinical review for details). There was no clinical data to Reviewer's comment: It is not likely that routine monitoring of patients following drug discontinuation would be sensitive enough to detect evidence of withdrawal effect. There may be a potential for cobimetinib to compete with opioid analgesics or for withdraw effect to result in increased risk of suicide or depression. The Applicant has been requested to provide additional information concerning the use of concomitant opioid use in patients on the GO28141 trial and for an analysis of suicide/depression reported to the cobimetinib database. It seems likely that these events could be effectively monitored with post marketing surveillance.</p></div>

While these detachments would be expected to result in permanent visual field defects if they remain unresolved, it is expected that most will resolve with temporary discontinuation of therapy and some will resolve while treatment is continued. At present, it is not known how frequently the detachments will resolve with continued treatment or how frequently they will resolve after discontinuation of treatment.</p><p>In addition to the serous detachments, approximately 10% of patients reported blurred vision while taking cobimetinib. Other clinically significant ocular events, uveitis/iritis, dry eye and retinal vein occlusions occurred in a small percentage of patients (0.4-2.4%)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations:</head><p>1. It is recommended that the proposed labeling be revised as identified above in this review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>It is recommended that additional information be collected to permit better characterization of the frequency, time course and if needed, dose alternation required to minimize the impact of retinal pigmented epithelial detachments in patients taking cobimetinib. The following information is recommended to be collected, but not necessarily prior to approval:</p><p>Integrated safety analyses from an adequate number of randomized controlled clinical trial(s) using cobimetinib to identify and characterize the risk of retinal pigmented epithelial detachments (RPED), including safety evaluations adequate to inform labeling of patient populations at highest risk and to provide evidence-based dose modification and monitoring recommendations in labeling of RPED events. On initial overview of the NDA/BLA application for filing:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Content Parameter Yes No NA Comment</head><p>FORMAT/ORGANIZATION/LEGIBILITY 1.
