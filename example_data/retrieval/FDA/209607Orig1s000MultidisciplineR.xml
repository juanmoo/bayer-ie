<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Product Introduction</head><p>On October 31, 2017, Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Progenics) submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) under 505(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for 131 I-iobenguane (metaiodobenzylguanidine, 131 I-iobenguane, iobenguane I-131, 131 I-MIBG, Azedra), a radiopharmaceutical. Iobenguane is a guanethidine derivative that resembles norepinephrine in structure; it acts as a substrate for the norepinephrine transporter (NT) expressed on neuroendocrine cell surfaces. It can be labeled with radioactive isotopes of iodine for diagnostic or therapeutic applications. Conventional formulations of MIBG are known as the "carrier-added" or "carrier-containing" forms of MIBG, because a significant quantity of non-radioactive (or "cold") carrier MIBG is present in the iobenguane I-131 dose administered to patients. In therapeutic administrations of carrier-added iobenguane I-131, the molar ratio of nonradioactive to radioactive MIBG molecules approaches . This imbalance of "cold" to radioactive MIBG can lead to pressor effects and reduction in efficacy in patients.</p><p>The carrier molecule iobenguane is a biogenic amine that interferes with the reuptake of norepinephrine, resulting in increased noradrenergic activity. When administered at high-mass doses, carrier-added MIBG can cause hypertension and other cardiovascular toxicity. The selective active uptake by the NT expressed on neuroendocrine cell surfaces is a competitive process; therefore, the presence of cold iobenguane molecules in the infusion solution can decrease the uptake in target neuroendocrine tumor cells.</p><p>FDA has approved carrier-added iobenguane as a diagnostic agent for use in localization of pheochromocytoma and neuroblastoma, and it has been studied as treatment for patients with advanced pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) and other neuroendocrine malignancies.</p><p>Progenics has developed a no-carrier-added version of iobenguane I-131 and the final product formulation . The final formulation is an injection containing 555 MBq/mL (15 mCi/ml) at TOC as a clear solution in a single-dose vial. The intended dosimetric dose is 5 -6 mCi for patients weighing 50.0 kg or more, and 0.1 mCi/kg for those weighing less than 50.0 kg. The intended therapeutic dose is 500 mCi (or 8 mCi/kg for patients weighing 62.5 kg or less, and an iobenguane chemical mass of ).</p><p>The current application proposes an indication for 131 I-iobenguane for the treatment of patients with iobenguane-avid metastatic or recurrent pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL). The indication to be granted is "…for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with iobenguane scan positive, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma who require systemic anticancer therapy." </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Conclusions on the Substantial Evidence of Effectiveness</head><p>The recommendations for approval of Azedra are supported primarily by one single-arm, multicenter trial entitled, "A Phase II Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of 131 I-MIBG in Patients with Malignant Relapsed/Refractory Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma," Study MIP-IB12B. The trial was conducted in patients greater than 12 years of age who were diagnosed with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma (PPGL) and who were ineligible for curative therapy. Patients had also progressed on prior therapy or were not candidates for chemotherapy. Other eligibility criteria required tumors to have definitive iobenguane avidity, at least one tumor site identified by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or iobenguane I 131 scan, Karnofsky performance status greater than 60, no active central nervous system lesions, and no changes to their antihypertensive regimen in the 30 days prior to the first therapeutic dose.</p><p>Iobenguane I 131 was administered in two therapeutic doses at 500 mCi each (8 mCi/kg, for patients weighing 62.5 kg or less) approximately three months apart. The doses were administered after an imaging dose and dosimetry. A total of 74 patients received the dosimetric dose. Following dosimetry, 68 patients received at least one therapeutic dose, and 50 patients received two therapeutic doses, administered at least 90 days apart. Among the 68 patients who received at least one dose, the median age was 55 years (16 to 72 years), 57% were male, 75% were White, 21% were Black, 4% were Asian and the remainder had no race or ethnicity reported. For the primary tumor diagnosis, 78% had pheochromocytoma, 21% had paraganglioma, and 1% had both. Fifty percent (50%) of patients with evaluable imaging studies had lung or liver metastases and 61% had bone metastases at baseline. Eighty-eight percent (88%) underwent prior surgery, 50% received prior external beam radiation.</p><p>The primary endpoint of the trial was the proportion of patients with a reduction by at least 50%, or discontinuation, of all antihypertensive medications for at least six months. The secondary objectives of the trial included assessment by RECIST for overall tumor response (ORR) to include complete response (CR) and partial response (PR), ORR including CR, PR, and moderate response (MR)-defined as decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of the target lesions of 15-30%, with no evidence of progressive disease (PD) in non-target lesions-and overall survival (OS) up to 5 years post-treatment. Other secondary endpoints were assessment of bone lesion status on the Soloway Scale, tumor marker response, quality of life (QOL) changes, changes in analgesic and pain medication use, and safety. Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit-Risk Summary and Assessment</head><p>The effectiveness of 131 I-iobenguane is supported by the results from Study MIP-IB12B, a multicenter, open-label, single arm trial conducted in 68 patients (68 patients received at least one therapeutic dose, and 50 patients received two therapeutic doses) 12 years and older with a diagnosis of unresectable pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. Patients were at least 12 years of age and were ineligible for curative therapy. Patients had also progressed on prior therapy for PPGL or were not candidates for chemotherapy.</p><p>The major efficacy outcome measure was the proportion of patients with a reduction (including discontinuation) of all antihypertensive medication by 50% or greater for at least six months after receiving two therapeutic doses each at 500 mCi (or 8 mCi/kg, for patients weighing 62.5 kg or less) of Ultratrace Iobenguane I 131 administered approximately three months apart. The secondary objectives included the proportion of patients with overall tumor response of CR or PR per RECIST criteria, the proportion of patients with overall tumor response of CR, PR or MR per RECIST, and overall survival up to 5 years post-treatment. The study consisted of a screening and dosimetry phase, a 12-month efficacy phase, and a four-year long-term follow-up phase.</p><p>The clinical benefit determination of 131 I-MIBG for patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic PPGL who require systemic anticancer therapy is based on the results of Study MIP-IB12B. The primary endpoint, a 50% reduction (including discontinuation) of antihypertensive medications for at least 6 months, was a new endpoint in the PPGL population. Given the morbidity associated with hypertension in this population, and the direct contribution of the tumor to hypertension through secretion of catecholamines, this endpoint was designed as a measure of direct clinical benefit. The primary endpoint was achieved by 25% of patients (95% CI: 16% -37%). The antitumor activity of 131 I-MIBG was confirmed by traditional tumor response criteria, i.e. RECIST v. 1.0 For ORR, 22.1% of the evaluable population (15 patients) demonstrated a confirmed, centrally reviewed response of PR (95% CI: 14%, 33%). There were 53% of patients who responded to therapy who maintained a duration of response at least six months.</p><p>There were no major statistical or other issues that alter the overall conclusions from Study MIP-IB12B. It is noted, however, that the limitation of single arm trial design prevents the study from providing adequate interpretation of the results of time to event endpoint such as OS, a secondary endpoint of the trial.</p><p>NDA/BLA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 209607} {AZEDRA, 131 I-MIBG} 18 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) Combined, durable response in hypertension reduction as measured by the primary endpoint coupled with confirmed objective tumor response are a measure of direct clinical benefit in this population.</p><p>Safety was evaluated in 88 patients who received at least one dose of 131 I-MIBG in two trials, the trial supporting the effectiveness of the drug, Study MIP-IB12B, and Study MIP-IB12, a multi-site, open-label, dose-escalation study of 131 I-MIBG in patients with PPGL. The primary objective of Study MIP-IB12 was to determine the maximum tolerated dose of 131 I-MIBG in patients with malignant PPGL. The data included in labeling in the warnings and precautions section of labeling comes from a pooled analysis of both trials.</p><p>The primary safety risks of 131 I-MIBG are related to the radiation exposure of the product. Myelosuppression and gastrointestinal adverse reactions were among the most common. The risk of myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia was less common, occurring in 7% of the pooled safety population. Although these events were largely confounded by prior, potentially leukemogenic therapy, this observation remains a significant and serious risk of 131 I-MIBG and requires further study. A greater percentage of patients who received two doses of 131 I-MIBG experienced cytopenias, sialoadenitis, and renal failure. The incidence of hypothyroidism (4% vs. 2.6%) was similar, irrespective of number of doses received. All patients who developed leukemia or MDS had received two doses of 131 I-MIBG on study. The most common severe (Grade 3-4) adverse reactions of treatment with 131 I-MIBG were lymphopenia (78%), neutropenia (59%), thrombocytopenia (50%), fatigue (26%), anemia (24%), and nausea (16%). Twelve percent of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions (thrombocytopenia, anemia, lymphopenia, nausea and vomiting, and multiple hematologic adverse reactions).</p><p>The serious nature of the aforementioned risks supports the use of 131 I-MIBG only in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic PPGL who require systemic anticancer therapy disease and who have no other known curative options.</p><p>Based on the rare incidence of this disease, demonstrated clinical benefit, and lack of approved therapeutic options, the review teams have recommended regular approval for 131 I-MIBG and this application. A risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) has not been recommended given the widespread experience with NA-131 I-MIBG, and the need for delivery of the product in centers certified to deliver radioactive therapies. A postmarketing requirement (PMR) will be completed to fully characterize the risk of developing secondary malignancies in patients treated with 131 I-MIBG. Risk management will also include product labeling and routine pharmacovigilance to ensure the safe and effective use of 131 I-MIBG. Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) Patients with iobenguane scan positive, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic PPGL who require systemic anticancer therapy represent a population with a serious and life-threatening rare disease for which there is no FDA-approved therapy and no known curative therapy. Although some patients demonstrate responses to off-label use of cytotoxic chemotherapy, complete responses are rare. Off-label use of NA-131 I-MIBG is a standard therapy for PPGL that cannot be cured by surgical resection alone. The safety profile of this radiopharmaceutical is consistent with other radiolabeled products and acceptable for a population of patients with PPGL as defined in the product label. The benefit: risk for 131 I-iobenguane weighs in favor of benefit for patients who have no other FDA-approved therapies and who need systemic treatment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Condition</head><p> Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are neuroendocrine tumors typically manifesting with clinical signs and symptoms related to catecholamine excess, such as headache, palpitations, diaphoresis, or lifethreatening hypertensive crisis.  Hypertension is the most common sign, observed in more than 95% of functional tumors.  Surgical resection may be curative; however, in patients with unresectable primary tumors, surgical debulking may be indicated to reduce tumor burden and decrease catecholamine levels.  Control of hypertension is critical in malignant PPGL due to lifethreatening acute hypertensive emergencies, as well as clinical consequences of long-lasting hypertension, which may result in devastating effects on multiple body systems leading to death if untreated.  A small reduction in blood pressure in hypertensive patients can reduce cardiovascular complications and improve overall survival.  Another major cause of death in patients with PPGLs is metastatic disease.  The incidence of malignant pheochromocytoma is unclear. The sponsor estimated an incidence of 60 to 120 per year in the US. The highest reported incidence of pheochromocytoma in the literature was 0.8 per Patients with PPGLs have serious and rare diseases with a high degree of morbidity and mortality, especially in the case of metastatic and malignant disease. A durable decrease in the incidence and severity of hypertension, the most common sign of the disease, in conjunction with an observed durable decrease in tumor burden represents a true benefit for these patients who have no FDAapproved treatments. Malignant PPGLs are generally resistant to chemotherapy; treatment is primarily aimed at palliative control of symptoms.  Survival for patients with metastatic PPGL depends upon the location of metastases. Patients with metastases to the lung and liver have a poor prognosis with survival of less than 2 years, while patients with metastases only to bone may survive more than 20 years after diagnosis. Estimates of the overall 5-year survival rate range from 20 -60%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current Treatment Options</head><p> Surgical removal or cytoreduction is the mainstay of treatment for PPGL.  There are no FDA-approved therapies for the treatment of iobenguane avid metastatic and/or recurrent PPGL.  The standard of care for locally advanced unresectable PPGLs includes symptomatic treatment with alpha blockade with or without alphamethytyrosine, cytoreductive surgery, radiation therapy, or 131 Imetaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) therapy.  For patients with distant metastasis, systemic chemotherapy (e.g. dacarbazine, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine or temozolomide), palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases, or non-AZEDRA 131 I-MIBG (NA-131I-MIBG) therapy are potential options, and clinical trials may be appropriate.  In the medical literature, various meta-analyses of the effects of combination chemotherapy, and NA-131 I-MIBG reported complete response rates of up to 4 percent and partial response rates of up to 37 percent.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dimension Evidence and Uncertainties Conclusions and Reasons</head><p>Benefit  Study MIP-IB12B was a multicenter, open-label, single arm study conducted in 68 patients 12 years and older with unresectable pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma that was conducted under SPA and achieved its primary endpoint.  The primary endpoint, a 50% reduction (including discontinuation) of antihypertensive medications for at least 6 months, was a new endpoint for oncology in this population.  Given the morbidity associated with hypertension for patients with PPGL and the direct contribution of the tumor to hypertension through secretion of catecholamines, the primary endpoint was deemed a measure of direct clinical benefit.  The primary endpoint was achieved by 25% of patients (95% CI 16.2% -36.5%).  The antitumor activity of 131 I-MIBG was confirmed by RECIST with 22.1% of patients demonstrating a confirmed, centrally reviewed response of PR (95% CI: 13.6%, 32.7%).  A secondary OS endpoint result was not interpretable in this single arm trial.</p><p>Patients with PPGL have serious and rare diseases with a high degree of morbidity and mortality, especially in the case of metastatic disease. A decrease in the incidence and severity of hypertension represented by a 50% or greater decrease in antihypertensive medications for at least 6 months experienced by 25% of patients, in conjunction with an observed antitumor response of 22%, represents a clinically meaningful benefit for patients with PPGL who require therapy have no FDA-approved treatments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risk and Risk Management</head><p> The primary safety risks of 131 I-MIBG are related to the radiation exposure of the product.  A greater percentage of patients who received two doses of 131 I-MIBG experienced cytopenias, sialoadenitis, and renal failure.  There was no significant difference in the development of hypothyroidism.  Myelosuppression and gastrointestinal adverse reactions were the most common.  The risk of myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia was less common, occurring in 7% of the pooled safety population.</p><p>In addition to labeling, a postmarketing requirement under section 505(o) will be included with the approval to follow late toxicities from the drug, specifically the development of myelodysplastic syndrome, acute leukemia, and other secondary malignancies. Refer to section 15 of this review for the specifics of the PMR. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Analysis of Condition</head><p>Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are neuroendocrine tumors with an incidence of two to eight cases per million per year in the United States.(National Cancer Institute, 2018)] Pheochromocytomas arise from chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla that commonly produce one or more catecholamines: epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Paragangliomas are derived from extra-adrenal chromaffin cells and characterized by either parasympathetic-associated chromaffin tissues (most commonly along cranial and vagus nerves) or sympathetic-associated chromaffin tissues (often designated as extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas). Approximately 80-85% of chromaffin cell tumors are pheochromocytomas; 15-20% of chromaffin cell tumors are paragangliomas.</p><p>PPGLs are diagnosed most frequently in adults between 40 and 50 years of age and typically manifest with clinical signs and symptoms related to catecholamine excess, such as headache, palpitations, diaphoresis, or life-threatening hypertensive crisis. Hypertension is the most common sign, observed in more than 95% of functional tumors. Surgical resection may be curative. In patients with unresectable primary tumors, surgical debulking may be indicated to reduce tumor burden which may decrease catecholamine levels. Control of hypertension is critical in malignant PPGL due to life-threatening acute hypertensive emergencies, as well as clinical consequences of long-lasting hypertension, which may result in devastating effects on multiple body systems leading to death if untreated. A small reduction in blood pressure in hypertensive patients may reduce cardiovascular complications and improve overall survival. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ayala-Ramirez, 2012)</ref> In addition to complications of hypertension, another major cause of death in patients with PPGLs is metastatic disease. According to the sponsor, approximately 10-20% of PPGLs are malignant, defined by the World Health Organization classification as the presence of distant metastases, not local invasion. The incidence of pheochromocytoma is unclear, but based on literature reports on the incidence of PPGL, there are approximately, 2 to 8 cases per million person years. A recent report estimated (approximately) 10% of cases to be malignant <ref type="bibr">(National Cancer Institute, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Park, 2011)</ref>. Clinical manifestations of malignant PPGL are like those of benign tumors; however, metastatic lesions can be life threatening (due to inability to control catecholamine excess or due to metastatic spread). Malignant PPGLs are generally resistant to chemotherapy; treatment is primarily aimed at palliative control of symptoms. Survival for patients with metastatic PPGL depends upon the location of metastases. Patients with metastases to the lung and liver have a poor prognosis with survival of less than 2 years, while patients with metastases only to bone may survive more than 20 years after diagnosis. <ref type="bibr">(Pacak, NDA/BLA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 209607} {AZEDRA, 131 I-MIBG} 26</ref> Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) 2007) Estimates of the overall survival 5-year survival rate range from 20 -60%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Pacak, 2007)</ref> Thus, while some patients, including some with metastatic disease, have a relatively long lifeexpectancy, some patients have a poor life expectancy and require systemic therapy.</p><p>Iobenguane, or metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), is a norepinephrine analog, and is taken up by norepinephrine transporters; thus, radiolabeled MIBG ( 123 I-MIBG and 131 I-MIBG) has been used for diagnostic purposes in tumors arising from the sympathetic nervous system, including pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma and neuroblastoma. Most pheochromocytomas are iobenguane avid, or are detectable via 131 I-MIBG or 123 I-MIBG scintigraphy; the sensitivity of these methods for detection of pheochromocytoma has been reported as 77 -90% and 85 -100%, respectively, though false negatives may occur in patients with tumors which are dedifferentiated or have undergone necrosis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Pacak, 2007)</ref> </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Summary of Presubmission/Submission Regulatory Activity</head><p>Reviewer note: The development program as agreed to in the SPA uses an unconventional endpoint to evaluate clinical benefit of 131 I-MIBG in a rare population. As noted in section 2.1, the incidence of pheochromocytoma is poorly defined, but it is estimated that 70-290 cases occur per year in the United States. As with other rare diseases, the small population presents numerous challenges in the recruitment for and conduct of clinical trials. PPGL may progress slowly, and overall have a variable natural history, which makes the use of a traditional endpoint such as overall survival difficult and time-consuming. The endpoint in this development program was chosen to evaluate a key cause of morbidity in PPGL and thereby reflect direct clinical benefit.  December 21, 2011: A pre-NDA meeting was held to discuss preclinical, clinical and CMC information for a proposed Subpart H Accelerated Approval NDA. FDA suggested a separate CMC meeting, and stated that the non-clinical program appeared adequately complete to support filing based on the meeting package, but that a final decision would be made following review of the data submitted with the NDA. At that time, the FDA suggested re-opening the trial, which had closed due to financial reasons, to collect data NDA/BLA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 209607} {AZEDRA, 131 I-MIBG} 29 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) on a total of 58 patients.

FDA agreed that a radiochemical purity specification of greater than or equal to % appeared reasonable based on the data provided, and that a determination of acceptability would be determined during review of the NDA.  July 26, 2015: FDA granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for "Ultratrace Iobenguane 131 I" for the treatment of patients with iobenguane-avid metastatic and/or recurrent pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) based on preliminary clinical evidence of efficacy obtained in Study MIP1B12B.  January 22, 2016: A Type B meeting was held to discuss the development program following Breakthrough Therapy designation. The agency agreed that a future NDA would receive rolling review on the basis of the Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations. FDA agreed that the NDA for 131 I Iobenguane would support approval of a treatment regimen that included both imaging and dosimetric doses. The agency stated that the endpoint in Study MIP-IB12B constituted a clinical benefit, provided the data are supported by an assessment that the product provides a significant advance over alternative therapy and the natural history of the disease. FDA stated that a determination of whether additional, randomized studies would be required would be made during review of the planned NDA. FDA also noted that analyses of time-to-event endpoints such as overall survival are not interpretable in a single arm study, and thus would not be included in product labeling. Agreement was reached that drug interaction studies in humans were not necessary, and that clinical pharmacology studies in patients with organ impairment were not necessary; however, the agency stated that the need for these studied would be evaluated during review of the data included in the original NDA submission.  April 11, 2016: FDA granted conditional acceptance of the proprietary name AZEDRA following review.  October 6, 2016: During a pre-NDA CMC meeting it was determined that 6-month stability data (long-term, intermediate and accelerated) for the 3 Drug Substance commercial batches would be submitted in the NDA and that 12 months of stability data (long-term and intermediate) will be submitted during NDA review (November 2017); it was agreed that 24 months of supportive long-term storage data from the clinical Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) batch would also be submitted in the NDA. FDA and MIP agreed that release data, stability data, executed batch records and information on synthesis equipment would be submitted for the 3 validation batches manufactured at , 3 validation batches manufactured at the , and three recent clinical batches . It was determined that in-use stability data, representing simulated conditions at the maximum dilution, would be included in the NDA. It was agreed that data from an extractable/leachable study, conducted at ambient room temperature for 24 hours in the primary container/closure system, using a cold formulation of 131 I-MIBG, would be included in the NDA. It was determined that justification and documentation that the container/closure components are resistant to radiolysis would be submitted in the NDA, and that release data, including impurities, for manufactured from the would be included in the NDA.  September 9, 2016: A Written Response Only letter was issued regarding content and format of the Integrated Summary of Safety, datasets, and presentation of efficacy data.  October 26, 2016: FDA agreed with Progenics's proposal, submitted August 22, 2016, providing justification for not conducting a thorough QT study with Iobenguane I 131.  November 18, 2016: MIP issued a response to FDA's Written Response Only (WRO) letter of September 9, 2016. MIP proposed to provide Analysis Dataset Model <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref> datasets for studies MIP-IB12B and MIP-IB13, but not for MIPIB-11 and MIP-IB12 as these studies were started in 2006 and 2007, respectively, and were previously completed and submitted to the IND in legacy format. FDA recommended that the Sponsor contact cder-edata@fda.hhs.gov to request a waiver to the proposed partial non-CDISC submission for studies MIP-IB11 and MIP-IB12 that are unsupported or retired by December 17, 2016. The request for the waiver was submitted on December 7, 2016.  January 17, 2017: A pre-NDA meeting was held. MIP sought feedback regarding the content and format of the intended NDA. FDA stated that it was amenable to receiving sections of the NDA on a rolling basis, and that the need for a REMS was not anticipated, but advised MIP to submit a detailed risk-benefit profile to the NDA. FDA requested that the 120-day safety update be submitted 90 days after NDA submission if possible. Progenics stated that it planned to submit one study report (pivotal study MIP-IB12B) in granular eCTD format and three study reports (MIP-IB11, MIP-IB12, and MIP-IB13) in legacy electronic format. FDA agreed that the plan was acceptable, however noted that the waiver regarding formatting was under review. MIP proposed a revised definition of primary outcome responder as follows (new wording underlined):</p><p>FDA stated that the revised definition was not acceptable, as it could result in classification of some patients as responders who would not be appropriate.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Division of Medical Imaging Products</head><p>DOP2 consulted the Division of Medical Imaging Products (DMIP) to review the radiation dosimetry, and expected organ and bone marrow exposure from treatment with 131 I-MIBG. DMIP concluded that the prescribing information provided by the Applicant insufficiently NDA/BLA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 209607} {AZEDRA, 131 I-MIBG} 33 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) described the risks associated with radiation. In particular, DMIP provided feedback regarding the potential risks of secondary malignancies and other acute and chronic radiation toxicities. DMIP suggested a different approach to dose-adjustment than that recommended by the Applicant. Rather than dose-adjustment based on specified absorbed activity thresholds in three specific organs, (the kidney, liver, and lungs), DMIP recommended dose-adjustment based on provider-identified critical organs. The specified absorbed activity thresholds were removed, to allow provider use of the best available clinical practice guidelines, and allow individualization of the prescribed absorbed dose-limits for each patient. DMIP provided a table including absorbed-dose thresholds for radiation toxicity in critical organs, based on the International Commission on Radiological Protection's Publication 118, for inclusion in the product labeling. Section 13.1 provides specific labeling changes made in collaboration with DMIP and the Applicant.</p><p>DMIP suggested inclusion of the following sentence in section 5.1: "Radiation epidemiological studies of survivors of the atomic bombing in Japan and studies of survivors of medical radiation therapy suggest that a 12-year-old child undergoing a full course of AZEDRA radiotherapy is likely to develop a secondary cancer sometime later in life as a result of the radiation exposure. An adult undergoing AZEDRA radiotherapy would face a less-than-50% chance for incidence of secondary cancer from the radiation." DOP 2 agreed with inclusion of a statement that the risks of radiation associated with the use of 131 I-MIBG are greater in pediatrics than in adults, but removed reference to atomic bomb survivors for the sake of brevity, and specific reference to secondary malignancy in this section given the dedication of section 5.3 to this topic. The concern for greater radiation-associated risks in pediatric patients due to greater absorbed radiation doses and potential longer life expectancy was reiterated in section 8.4 of the product labeling.</p><p>DMIP provided literature references indicating that, for some patients with tumors under 5.5 cm, the five-year overall survival rate ranged between 94.7 and 100%; the longer life expectancy of these patients would require additional consideration in the benefits and risks of a treatment associated with long-term radiation toxicities including secondary malignancies. Therefore, DMIP agreed with DOP2 that the indication should be restricted to a population with a reduced life expectancy, given the risks of long-term toxicities, which is reflected in the revised product labeling. DMIP discussed the potential risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease 10 -15 years after exposure to irradiation with 131 I-MIBG. This risk was not specifically addressed in product labeling because it was not observed in the clinical development program. In addition, DOP2 noted that the population of patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic PPGL had a relatively shorter life expectancy, and would not be expected to live 10 -15 years without further therapy. A 5-year survival of 95 -100% is not expected in the population specified by the indication statement. Refer to the clinical reviewer's discussion of prognosis and treatment options in Section 2 Therapeutic Context NDA/BLA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 209607} {AZEDRA, 131 I-MIBG} 34 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) DMIP also noted that prediction of radiation absorbed dose for two subsequent therapeutic doses based on a single dosimetric assessment had some limitations. DMIP concluded that an assumption of proportionality of radiation absorbed dose between dosimetric dose and therapeutic dose, as well as consistency in absorbed dose between therapeutic doses, was reasonable but not certain based on the data provided. Changes to product labeling were not suggested based on this observation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Executive Summary</head><p>131 I Meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is a radioactive therapeutic agent; it is a guanethidine analog, structurally similar to norepinephrine, that shares the same uptake, storage, and release mechanisms as norepinephrine. Due to this structural similarity, MIBG concentrates in highly sympathetically innervated tissues with high levels of norepinephrine transporter (NET), including the adrenal gland and heart. In addition, MIBG can concentrate in neuroendocrine tumors that have high levels of NET, including pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL), which can take up MIBG and store it in neurosecretory granules. Iodine 131 is a beta and gamma emitting isotope with a half-life of 8 days and penetration length of 0.6 to 2 mm that induces cellular damage by the production of free radicals.</p><p>Pharmacology studies submitted in the form of published articles demonstrated the shared uptake mechanism of MIBG and biogenic amines through NET. Studies showed differences in MIBG uptake and storage in tumors of different origins. Uptake of radiolabeled MIBG was saturable in both PC-12 rat pheochromocytoma and SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells, but in the pheochromocytoma cells MIBG was stored in vesicular granules, leading to longer exposures. Due to their origin, neuroblastoma cells do not have vesicular granules. In SK-N-SH cells, but not in some other neuroblastoma cell lines, MIBG was able to concentrate in the extra-vesicular space resulting in limited long term retention. Differences in uptake and retention between NET positive tumors of different origins may help account for differences in clinical activity to 131 I MIBG therapy.</p><p>The Applicant presented data showing that 131 I MIBG administration resulted in anti-tumor activity in mice implanted with PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells and in some sensitive neuroblastoma cell lines. Generally, radiolabeled MIBG preparations with high specific activity led to better anti-tumor activity. High specific activity MIBG preparations also resulted in modest increases in radioactivity exposure in organs with cells that have NET expression, but lower levels of cold MIBG exposure in these organs. Lower exposure to MIBG itself may lead to fewer MIBG-related toxicities, particularly pharmacologically-mediated increases in blood pressure. Consistent with its mechanism of action, clear increases in arterial pressure with reflex bradycardia occurred in a cardiovascular study in dogs at unlabeled MIBG doses ≥ of 0.3 mg/kg; this dose is approximately 60 times higher than the amount of MIBG given at the radiotherapeutic dose of Azedra. MIBG exhibited low potential for hERG-mediated QTc prolongation with an IC 50 of 93.6 M, which is about 200-fold higher than the maximum theoretical blood concentration of MIBG at the therapeutic dose of Azedra in humans. Consistent with this finding, there were no QT interval effects at MIBG doses of up to 3 mg/kg in dogs or at a cold-labeled MIBG ( 127 I MIBG) dose of 1.085 mg/kg. Pharmacokinetic and distribution studies assessed the difference in pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of Ultratrace Iobenguane 131 I and CIS-US Iobenguane 131 I. The Ultratrace product employs a solid state labeling technique resulting in less than 0.0028 mg carrier Iobenguane /mCi while the CIS technique uses a carrier added labeling approach resulting in ~ 0.3 mg carrier Iobenguane /mCi with lower specific activity. Regardless of labelling method, the kidney was the predominant organ for MIBG clearance, and 131 I-MIBG cleared with elimination half-lives of approximately 16 hours in rat, and 32 hours in dogs. In rats administered with equivalent doses of radioactivity, the tissue distribution and exposure of Ultratrace 131 I-MIBG and commercially available carrier-added 131 I-MIBG were highly similar. At the single IV dose of 40 mCi/kg of Ultratrace 131 I-MIBG in rats, the highest levels of accumulated radioactivity occurred in the lungs, heart and adrenals (≥223 nCi/g) followed by the kidneys, salivary glands, thyroid ( ≥ 100 nCi/g), liver, small intestine, adipose tissue and bone (51-80 nCi/g). Based on the literature, bone marrow (34 nCi/g in this assessment) is the dose limiting organ for 131 I-MIBG.</p><p>In a 28-day repeat IV dose toxicity study in dogs Ultratrace 127 I-MIBG (cold product) was tolerated at doses up to 1.085 mg/kg (21700 g/m 2 ), the highest dose tested. Findings in this study were limited to injection site reactions. There were no major target organs of MIBG toxicity. Toxicities caused by radiation are well described and are expected following administration of Azedra in patients with malignant recurrent pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL).</p><p>The Applicant did not conduct carcinogenicity studies and these studies are not required to support the marketing application for a drug intended to treat advanced cancer. The cold 127 I-MIBG was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay and was negative for clastogenic activity in vitro in mouse lymphoma cells and in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. As 131 I-MIBG is a radioactive product, it is both genotoxic and potentially carcinogenic. Due to its genotoxicity, and consistent with the ICH S9 Guidance, no reproductive toxicology studies were conducted or required to support the marketing of 131 I-MIBG. The risk of radiopharmaceuticals to a developing fetus is well-established in the scientific literature.</p><p>The nonclinical team recommends a warning for the potential for embryo-fetal toxicity and the inclusion of advice for females and males of reproductive potential to use contraception during NDA/BLA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 209607} {AZEDRA, 131 I-MIBG} 36 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) and for 7 and 4 months, respectively, following the last dose of Azedra. In addition, because this is an 131 I-labeled product, women are advised not to breastfeed during and for 80 days following the last dose of Azedra. There are no outstanding issues from a pharmacology/toxicology perspective that would prevent approval of the Azedra for treatment of patients years and older with Iobenguane avid malignant, recurrent, or unresectable pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma therefore the pharmacology/toxicology team recommends approval.</p></div>

In Vitro Studies</head><p>The Applicant demonstrated the affinity and selective uptake of MIBG into cells that express noradrenaline transporter (NET) using a published study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Boyd et al 2004</ref>. Investigators compared the effects of incubation of a radiation-resistant human glioma cell line (UVW), either stably expressing NET or untransformed, with 7 kBq of 131 I-MIBG (specific activity 45-65 MBq/mg) in the presence or absence of 1.5mM desmethylimipramine (DMI), a potent NET inhibitor.</p><p>In vitro, cells expressing NET had ~27-fold higher uptake of radioactive MIBG compared to uptake in cells without NET expression. Similar differences in uptake occurred between NET positive cells in the absence or presence of DMI ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>). Additionally, in an in vivo experiment, nude mice were implanted with each of the two cell types and later treated with no-carrier added 131 I-MIBG or a carrier-added form of the drug to compare the biodistribution in both xenografted tumors and mouse tissues. The carrier added vs. non-carrier added represent two manufacturing process resulting in different specific activities for the radiolabeled drug. NET positive tumors had significantly higher concentrations of either formulation of the drug than NET negative tumors. Overall distribution was similar in all tissues for each of the drug formulations with slightly increased levels of radioactivity in high NET expressing tissues for the no carrier added product. Tissues with the highest levels of radioactivity included the adrenal gland, heart, liver, lung, and kidney <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 1)</ref>.    <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Boyd et al. 2004)</ref> The Applicant <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Barrett et al. 2010</ref>, describes a solid labeling approach to make a non-carrier-added radiolabeled MIBG. Solid labeling with 123 I or 131 I resulted in higher specific activity of radioactive iodine labeled MIBG with less unlabeled MIBG compared to other methods. Investigators then assessed the impact of cold carrier MIBG versus other radiolabeling methods on tissue distribution of 123/131 I MIBG in the conscious rat. The carrier free Ultratrace MIBG radiolabeled with either 123 I or 131 I exhibited similar radioactive tissue distribution as the carrier added radiolabeled MIBG following administration of the drug on a μCi/kg basis, but the higher specific activity of the Ultratrace product resulted in much lower MIBG exposures compared to the carrier added product ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 2</ref>). In the heart, with high expression of NET, the higher specific activity of the ultratrace preparation resulted in some Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) increases in radioactivity exposure compared to preparations with higher amounts of unlabeled MIBG.</p><p>The investigators also showed a dose-dependent increase in arterial pressure concomitant with a reflex bradycardia in conscious instrumented dogs treated with unlabeled MIBG. Mean arterial pressure increases of up to 45% occurred in dogs at the IV administered unlabeled MIBG dose of 3000 g/kg, accompanied by heart rate decreases of up to 43%, whereas arterial pressure increases at the 30 μg/kg dose were only 13%. Based on these findings, radiolabeled MIBG products with higher specific activity and, therefore, lower doses of unlabeled MIBG may lead to relative decreases in the cardiovascular side effects of hypertension and bradycardia associated with MIBG exposure compared to low specific activity MIBG products.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2: Radioactive vs. MIBG Exposure in High vs Low Specificity Activity Radiolabeled MIBG Products</head><p>Radioactive Exposure MIBG Exposure (Adapted from <ref type="bibr">Barrett et al., 2011)</ref> To explore the uptake and retention of MIBG in neural crest tumor cell lines including both pheochromocytoma and neuroblastoma cells, the Applicant referenced <ref type="bibr">Smets et al., (Cancer Research 1989</ref><ref type="bibr">, 49:2941</ref><ref type="bibr">-2944</ref>. The authors measured uptake of extracellular MIBG in cell cultures of SK-N-SH or several other human neuroblastoma cells incubated for 2 hours with 125 I MIBG (10 -8 M) in the presence or absence of imipramine, a NET blocker, or in the presence or absence of excess unlabeled MIBG or NE. In the SK-N-SH cells, but not other neuroblastoma cell lines, there was evidence of active uptake of MIBG (decreased cell associated radioactivity in the presence of imipramine). Passive diffusion occurred in all cell lines tested.</p><p>In chromaffin derived cells like the PC-12 pheochromocytoma cell line, MIBG is stored in secretory granules. By blocking intracellular transport into storage granules with reserpine, the authors showed decreases in MIBG retention of up to 50% in the PC-12 cells, but not in SK-N-SH cells ( <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). This difference in retention between different types of neural crest derived tumors along with differences in uptake in different neuroblastoma cell lines may explain differences in sensitivities of these NET-positive types of tumors to treatment with 131 I-MIBG.    <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mairs et al. 1995a)</ref> Absorption was calculated by estimating the areas under the time-activity curves, corrected for radionuclide decay, and multiplying by the equilibrium dose constant for 131 I. In practice, injected radiolabeled MIBG activity is usually limited by bone marrow toxicity. Based on the above results, if the absorbed dose to the bone marrow is directly proportional to blood dose, the non-carrier-added preparation would deliver a slightly reduced bone marrow dose of radioactivity, suggesting that the higher specific activities of non-carrier-added preparations could result in better therapy. In addition, these results suggest that a higher tumor-radiation absorption dose is possible, but with increases of radioactivity to the heart and adrenals as well.</p><p>Radioactive uptake by SK-N-BE (2c) active transport competent neuroblastoma cells was higher at higher doses for the exchange-labeled non-carrier added 131 I-MIBG when compared to a commercial carrier-added preparation ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref>). Carrier-added 131 I-MIBG accumulation plateaued at 100 kBq, while nca 131 I-MIBG continued to accumulate even at levels at which there was no further accumulation with the carrier added product. Mairs and collaborators <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Mairs et al., 1995b)</ref> also showed that A2780 control cells which only take up MIBG by passive activity incorporated equivalent amounts of non-carrier added (nca) and carrier added (ca) 131 I-MIBG (data not shown).  (Excerpted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mairs et al., 1995b)</ref> B. In Vivo Studies Studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Rutgers et al. (2000a and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">2000b)</ref> demonstrated the activity of 131 I-MIBG in the treatment of mice implanted with PC-12 rat pheochromocytoma cells or SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells. While both cell types express NET and actively take up MIBG, the storage mechanisms for MIBG differ between the cell types. Implanted PC12 tumors had more extensive accumulation and higher MIBG exposure than the SK-N-SH tumors following treatment of mice with 131 I-MIBG ( <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>), resulting in a relative increase in tumor growth delay in the pheochromocytoma line compared to the neuroblastoma line <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). 131 I-MIBG also showed some anti-tumor activity in a model of metastatic pheochromocytoma in these experiments.</p></div>

Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, pulse pressure, body temperature, ECG parameters (PR, QRS, QT, and QTcB), respiratory frequency, tidal volume, and minute volume were measured continuously for approximately 3 hours predosing and 48 hours post-dosing. In males, dose-dependent increases in arterial pressure including systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure, and lower heart rate were noted at all dose levels. Increases of up to 55% and 49% in systolic and diastolic pressure, respectively, occurred at the high dose level of 3 mg/kg when compared to controls. In females, similar trends were present at doses ≥0.3 mg/kg, though at the low dose of 0.03 there were no increases in blood pressure (data not shown).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6.1">General Dosing</head><p>The proposed dosing regimen for 131 I-MIBG is:</p><p> One dosimetric dose administered via intravenous (IV) bolus injection: 5 to 6 mCi (185 to 222 MBq) for patients weighing &gt; 50 kg 0.1 mCi/kg (3.7 MBq/kg) for patients weighing ≤ 50 kg  Two therapeutic Doses administered IV over 30 minutes and separated by 3 months apart: 500 mCi (18.5 GBq) for patients weighing &gt; 62.5 kg 8 mCi/kg (296 MBq/kg) for patients weighing ≤ 62.5 kg The proposed dosing regimen is supported by the clinically significant proportion of patients who experienced a 50% or greater reduction of all antihypertensive medication for at least six months and an acceptable safety profile observed in the phase 2, single-arm Study MIP-IB12B. The Applicant submitted PK data from 11 patients in Study MIP-IB11 who were administered a single 5.0-mCi (185 MBq) dosimetric dose of 131 I-MIBG, and therefore, no exposure-response analysis for either efficacy or safety were performed. The MTD determined in the dose escalation Study MIP-IB12 in 21 patients support the proposed dosing regimen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6.2">Therapeutic Individualization</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specific Populations</head><p>No formal studies were conducted for 131 I-MIBG in patients with renal impairment. Dose adjustment for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment is adequately addressed used the proposed dosing regimens with the built-in dosimetric steps. In Study MIP-IB12B, dosimetry data were analyzed to estimate the radioactivity exposure in patients with normal and mild-to-moderate renal impairment. Patients were stratified into two groups by their creatinine clearance (CrCl) as calculated using Cockcroft-Gault equation (patients with normal renal function with CrCl &gt; 90 mL/min, n=31 and patients with mild-to-moderate renal NDA/BLA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 209607} {AZEDRA, 131 I-MIBG} 55 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) impairment with CrCL=30-90 mL/min, n=43). The results demonstrated that only 8 out of 43 patients (18%) with mild-to-moderate renal impairment required reduction to their therapeutic dosage. The rest of the patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (n = 35) received administered the full therapeutic dosage. Thus, the dosimetry step allows for an individualized dose adjustment and serves as a safety check point for patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment.</p><p>Patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl &lt; 30 mL/min) were not enrolled in any of the clinical trials conducted by the Applicant. Based on the Information Request dated 1/31/2018, the Applicant performed a post-hoc analysis to simulate and predict the exposure of 131 I-MIBG in patients with severe renal impairment using dosimetry data from patients in Study MIP-IB11. The dosimetry results from study MIP-1B11 showed that 27% (3 of 11) of patients were indicated to receive a therapeutic dose (mCi) reduction. Under the assumption of zero renal clearance, the simulated absorbed radioactive doses to the kidneys, liver, and lungs increased by 42%, 41%, and 53%, respectively, and thus, 100% (11 of 11) of patients would be predicted to have a therapeutic dose reduction. In addition, the efficacy data from Studies MIP-IB12 and MIP-IB12B were used to determine the best overall confirmed response of progressive disease (PD), stable disease (SD), partial response (PR), or complete response (CR). In Study MIP-IB12, patients received a single 131 I-MIBG therapeutic dose ranging from 325 mCi to 696 mCi and the lowest administered therapeutic doses associated with radiologic responses of PR and SD were 571 mCi and 325mCi, respectively. In Study MIP-IB12B, 10 patients, who received one 131 I-MIBG therapeutic dose that ranged from 380 mCi to 539 mCi, achieved SD responses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DDI Potential</head><p>No formal in vivo DDI studies were conducted for 131 I-MIBG. Dose adjustment for concomitant medications is adequately addressed used the proposed dosing regimens with the built-in dosimetric steps. The potential for a DDI between 131 I-MIBG and other concomitant mediations is not expected as 131 I-MIBG undergoes minimal metabolism and eliminated primary by the kidneys. In addition, the results from in vitro studies conducted by the Applicant indicate that 131 I-MIBG does not inhibit or induce any major CYP isozymes at clinically relevant concentrations, and it is not a substrate or an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Thus, the potential for PK-based interactions is unlikely in vivo. Per agreement with the Agency at the Type B meeting on 1/22/2016, clinical DDI studies with 131 I-MIBG are not necessary. However, a potential for pharmacodynamic DDIs may exist between 131 I-MIBG (a substrate of norepinephrine transporter <ref type="bibr">[NET]</ref>) and drugs that inhibit NET (e.g., amitryptiline, imipramine, antidepressants), drugs that deplete norepinephrine stores (e.g., antihypertensives) and drugs that inhibit reuptake at NET sites (e.g., sympathomimetric amines and cocaine). This risk is adequately addressed in the Applicant's proposed labeling under the Drug Interactions section.</p></div>

The radiation dose to patients with severe renal impairment may be increased due to the delayed elimination of the drug. Individualized therapeutic dose adjustment based on radiation exposure estimates from the dosimetry step is recommended for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-89 mL/min). In Study IB12B, of the 43 patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30-90 mL/min using the Cockcroft Gault calculation), 8 (18.6%) required therapeutic dose reductions based on radiation dose estimates to critical organs exceeding Emami limits (absorbed dose exceeding 23 Gy). The pharmacokinetics of iobenguane I-131 has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min), end stage renal disease, or hepatic impairment.</p><p>DDIs: Labetalol, a combined alpha and beta blocker, has been reported to reduce iobenguane uptake and deplete intracellular storage in patients. Labetalol is to be discontinued for at least 5 biological half-lives prior to and following 131 I-MIBG administration and other appropriate alpha-or beta-blockers are to be used to control hypertension.</p><p>Severe treatment-related hematological adverse reactions including thrombocytopenia may be exacerbated in patients receiving medications that interfere with platelet function or coagulation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Does the clinical pharmacology program provide supportive evidence of effectiveness?</head><p>Evidence of effectiveness in this NDA submission was obtained from the pivotal phase 2, singlearm Study MIP-IB12B in 68 patients with PPGL as demonstrated in the sections below of this review. The PK of 131 I-MIBG was determined in 11 patients (7 with carcinoid tumors and 4 with PPGL). Each patient received a single intravenous (IV) bolus dose of 131 I-MIBG at a target level of 5.0 mCi (1.85 GBq) supplemented with the mass of 0.185 mg cold MIBG equivalent to the maximum projected therapeutic dose. The radioactivity in blood, plasma and urine samples collected up to 120 hours after dosing. Fecal samples were not collected in this study as only negligible amounts of injected dose (&lt;1% of) have been excreted in the feces following IV dosing of <ref type="bibr">131</ref>  Results from this step are used to confirm tumor avidity and to allow for individual therapeutic dose adjustment, if necessary, to protect from radiation overexposure to critical organs.</p><p>The rationale for the therapeutic dose of 500 mCi (18.5 GBq) was based on the results from the phase 1 dose-escalation Study MIP-IB12 in 21 patients with PPGL. Initially, all patients received a single 5 mgCi dosimetric dose of 131 I-MIBG supplemented with 0.185 mg of cold MIBG to confirm uptake of radioactivity by at least one known tumor on the two or 3 whole body scans performed 2 to 7 days after dosing. When the uptake of radioactivity by at least one tumor was confirmed, three patients then received a starting therapeutic IV dose of 6 mCi/kg. This starting dose was then escalated in cohorts of 3-6 patients to 7 mCi/kg, 8 mCi/kg and 9 mCi/kg until the MTD was established. The maximum injected dose was not to exceed that of a 75-kg patient (i.e., 450, 525, 600, or 675 mCi for the 6, 7, 8 and 9 mCi/kg dose groups, respectively).</p><p>The distribution of total administered dose (mCi/GBq) and occurrence of DLTs across all cohorts is summarized in Applicant's <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref> below. The DLTs observed in this study included thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, decreased platelet count and low absolute neutrophil count in 4 patients (actual administered radioactivity of 524 mCi (7 mCi/kg), 588 mCi (8 mCi/kg), 662 mCi (9 mCi/kg), and 680 mCi (9 mCi/kg) in each patient). Based on the occurrence of two DLTs (two events of low absolute neutrophil count [ANC]) at the 9 mCi/kg dose, the MTD was determined to be 8 mCi/kg (588 mCi). Based on the results from this study, a total administered dose of 500 mCi (18.5 GBq) or 8 mCi/kg (0.296 GBq/kg) if body weight was less than 62.5 kg was chosen as the therapeutic dose in the pivotal phase 2 Study MIP-IB12B.</p></div>

The most commonly reported TEAEs included nausea (71.6%), thrombocytopenia (66%), anemia (58%), leukopenia (55%), fatigue (55%), neutropenia (53%), vomiting (48%), dry mouth (38%), dizziness (38%) and headache (28%). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>QT/QTc Prolongation</head><p>As per the FDA's IRT-QT review, the results from Study IB12B indicate no large mean increases in the ΔQTc interval (i.e., 20 ms) with the proposed therapeutic dosing regimen of 131 I-MIBG, based on central tendency analysis (largest 90% CI upper bound was 14.5 ms at 1 h post-dose after administration of second therapeutic dose). None of the patients had QTcF &gt;500 ms and only one patients had ΔQTcF &gt;60 ms. There was no placebo or positive control in the study. In this open-label, multicenter, single-arm, Phase 2 study, 74 patients received dosimetric doses (3-6 mCi by IV injection) and 68 patients received at least one therapeutic dose of AZE 131 I-MIBG DRA (500 mCi for patients &gt; 62.5 kg and 8 mCi/kg for patients ≤ 62.5 kg; 2 therapeutic doses 3 months apart). Overall summary of findings is presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 12</ref> below. Is an alternative dosing regimen or management strategy required for subpopulations based on intrinsic patient factors?</p><p>Dose adjustment for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment is adequately addressed used the proposed dosing regimen with the built-in dosimetric step.</p><p>The current proposed dosing regimen allows for individualized dose adjustment for patients with renal impairment based on the dosimetric step. Therefore, no formal PK studies were needed to assess the influence of organ impairment on 131 I-MIBG exposure, as agreed upon with the Agency during the Type B meeting dated 1/22/2016.</p><p>In Study MIP-IB12B, the dosimetry data were analyzed to estimate the radioactivity exposure in patients with renal impairment stratified into two groups by their creatinine clearance <ref type="formula">(</ref> Patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl &lt; 30 mL/min) have not been enrolled in any of the clinical trials conducted by the Applicant. Information Request was sent on 1/31/2018 requesting the Applicant to perform some analyses to predict the exposure of 131 I-MIBG in patients with severe renal impairment, to determine the minimum dose required for efficacy based on experience in PPGL and to assess whether the predicted dose in patients with severe renal impairment would lead to exposures that fall below this threshold. A post-hoc analysis was performed to simulate severe renal impairment using dosimetry data from patients in Study MIP-IB11 in 11 patients. Simulations were performed to generate absorbed radiation dose estimates and maximum absorbed radiation dose (Gy) to the critical organs (kidneys, liver, and lungs) per Emami limit in the worst-case scenario of extreme renal impairment, i.e. no renal clearance. The dosimetry results showed that 27% (3 of 11) of patients were indicated to receive a therapeutic dose (mCi) reduction. Under the assumption of zero renal clearance, the simulated absorbed radioactive doses to the kidneys, liver, and lungs increased by 42%, 41%, and 53%, respectively, and thus, 100% (11 of 11) of patients would be predicted to have therapeutic dose reduction. In cases of severe renal impairment, the absorbed radioactive doses to the critical organs will increase and therapeutic dose reductions will be required. Based on simulation results of no renal function using the dosimetry dataset from Study MIP-IB11, the projected maximum therapeutic dose ranged from 493 mCi to 993 mCi (Applicant's <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 15</ref>). In addition, the efficacy data from Studies MIP-IB12 and MIP-IB12B were used to determine the best overall confirmed response of progressive disease (PD), stable disease (SD), partial response (PR), or complete response (CR). In Study MIP-IB12, patients received a single 131 I-MIBG therapeutic dose ranging from 325 mCi to 696 mCi (Applicant's <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 16</ref>), and the lowest administered therapeutic doses associated with radiologic responses of PR and SD were 571 mCi and 325 mCi, respectively. In Study MIP-IB12B, 10 patients, who received one 131 I-MIBG therapeutic dose that ranged from 380 mCi to 539 mCi, achieved SD responses (Applicant's <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 16</ref>). All responders with confirmed radiographic responses of PR received two therapeutic doses of 131 I-MIBG at levels ranging from 891 mCi to 1010 mCi.</p><p>NDA/BLA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 209607} {AZEDRA, 131 I-MIBG} 69 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews)  MIBG is not an inducer of any CYP enzyme at clinically relevant concentrations:</p><p>The induction potential of MIBG on the activities of CYP 1A, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19 and 3A was evaluated in human hepatocytes at concentrations of 0.5, 1.5, or 5 μM. Exposure of the MIBG, at any in vitro concentration tested, did not elicit substantial increases in CYP1A, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A enzyme activities. In addition, the increases in these enzyme activities were &lt;40% compared to the induction by probe inducers. Thus, in vivo drug-drug interactions resulting from the induction of CYP 1A, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A enzyme activities are unlikely (See Applicant's <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 18</ref> below).</p></div>

Inhibition of P-gp mediated efflux of vinblastine was evaluated at MIBG concentrations of 0.1, 1, 3, 10, and 30 μM. MIBG was found to have low mean apparent permeability in Caco-2 cell monolayers that was independent of the direction of transport evaluated (≤2.89 x 10 -6 cm/s). In addition, the apparent permeability of vinblastine in the presence of various MIBG concentrations ranged from 14.2 to 23.1 indicating lack of inhibition of P-gp by MIBG. Thus, MIBG was determined to be a low permeability compound that was neither a P-gp substrate nor a P-gp inhibitor (see <ref type="bibr">Applicant's</ref>   No formal clinical DDI studies were conducted for 131 I-MIBG as agreed during the Type B meeting dated 1/22/2016. Drugs that are combined alpha and beta adrenergic receptors blockers (labetalol) or drugs that deplete norepinephrine (reserpine) may interfere with the efficacy of MIBG. In an article by Jacobson and Travin, it was reported that labetalol has consistently been shown to significantly interfere with MIBG uptake due to its combined significant beta-and alpha-receptor antagonistic activity (Arnold F. Jacobson, AF and Travin, MI: Impact of medications on MIBG uptake, with specific attention to the heart: Comprehensive review of the literature. <ref type="bibr">J Nucl Cardiol 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">22:980 -993)</ref>. Evidence also indicates that reserpine interferes with MIBG uptake due to NE depletion through irreversible inactivation of vesicular monoamine transporter, thereby preventing norepinephrine storage in vesicles and increasing the rate of enzymatic degradation and diffusion from nerve terminals. As per the authors, there is significant in vitro and in vivo evidence for inhibition of MIBG uptake for only labetalol and reserpine. Based on these data, it is recommended that labetalol and reserpine should be discontinued prior to and following 131 I-MIBG administration. The results of the present review are summarized in Authors' table below. Accordingly, the Applicant revised the package insert originally submitted on 1/12/2018 to include this information and resubmitted the package insert on 2/9/2018.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Review Strategy</head><p>The FDA statistical and clinical BLA review team consisted of one primary statistical reviewer of efficacy and one primary clinical reviewer of safety and efficacy. The NDA submission contained data from four studies, listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">Table 20,</ref>  The study consists of a screening and dosimetry phase, a 12-month efficacy phase, and a fouryear long-term follow-up phase. Approximately 75 patients were expected to enroll to ensure that 58 patients were evaluable for safety and efficacy. Eligible patients receive two doses of 131 I-MIBG (500 mCi, or 8mCi/kg for patients &lt;62.5 kg, per dose), three months apart, administered after an imaging dose and dosimetry.</p><p>Patients enrolled on this study were required to be ineligible for curative surgery for PPGL, and had either failed a prior therapy for PPGL, or were not candidates for chemotherapy. Patients were required to be on a stable antihypertensive medication regimen for tumor-related hypertension for at least 30 days prior to the first therapeutic dose, and had at least one tumor site by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or MIBG scan. Patients' tumors were required to have definitive MIBG avidity and an expected survival of at least 6 months, as predicted by the physician. Exclusion criteria included previous systemic radiotherapy resulting in marrow toxicity within three months of study entry, receipt of prior whole-body irradiation, or external beam radiotherapy to &gt;25% of bone marrow. In addition, patients receiving a medication which inhibited tumor uptake of iobenguane I 131 were excluded. Potassium iodide was administered from 24 hours prior to 131 I-MIBG and continued for 10 days. A dosimetric dose of 5 to 6 mCi (or 0.1 mCi/kg for patients weighing &lt;50 kg) was administered, followed by three Iobenguane I 131 scans of the entire body to confirm uptake of the agent, assess biodistribution, and determine dosimetry. The dosimetry scans were reviewed to ensure that the planned therapeutic doses would not deliver greater than 23 Gray absorbed dose to the kidney, 17.5 Gy to the lungs, or 30 Gy to the liver. Following therapeutic dose administration, patients had a complete body scan within 7 days to assess biodistribution.</p><p>Hematologic recovery was required prior to administration of the second dose. The second dose could be delayed from 12 to up to 24 weeks after the first therapeutic dose. In the event of severe hematologic toxicity (febrile neutropenia, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with active bleeding or CTCAE Grade 4 hematologic toxicity of lasting more than 1 week), the protocol required a dose reduction to 425 mCi or 7mCi/kg for patients ≤62.5 kg.</p><p>Patients were followed twice weekly during the first 6 weeks after each dose, and once a week for remaining weeks through week 24; they were then followed monthly (months 7 -12) and every 6 months during long term follow-up. Tumor response was evaluated with CT or MRI scans obtained every 3 months for 1 year. Overall tumor response at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months per RECIST criteria was assessed centrally by independent, blinded readers. Tumor markers (serum chromogranin A, plasma-free metanephrines, plasma catecholamines, 24-hour urinary vanillylmandelic acid and catecholamines, and urinary metanephrines) were measured every 2 weeks for 24 weeks, and every month during months 7 to 12.</p><p>Safety was evaluated by analysis of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events of special interest (AESIs), baseline and pre-versus postadministration electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examinations, vital signs, laboratory assessments, and human radiation absorbed dose estimates to target lesions and normal organs. Following the 12-month assessment, patients entered a 4-year long term follow-up (LTFU) phase to assess OS, tumor markers, and use of antihypertensive medication and concomitant medications, until the patient experienced disease progression, started another anticancer therapy, or died.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Endpoints</head><p>As agreed upon in the SPA, the primary endpoint for this study is the proportion of patients who received at least one therapeutic dose with a reduction (including discontinuation) of all antihypertensive medications by at least 50% for at least six months, beginning during the 12month efficacy phase. Secondary endpoints are as follows:  Incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events of special interest (AESIs), deaths, and discontinuations due to AEs, status of hypertension, changes in blood pressure (BP), and changes in the use of analgesics and pain medications  Clinical laboratory measurements (including hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), physical examinations, vital signs, ECG measurements, and concomitant medications  Human radiation absorbed dose estimates to target lesions and normal organs were also assessed in this study</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis Plan</head><p>There was no formal hypothesis testing planned in Study MIP-IB12B; therefore, no statistical inference is drawn based on data from the study. Per the statistical analysis plan NDA/BLA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 209607} {AZEDRA, 131 I-MIBG} 78 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) (SAP), the duration of benefit (duration with a reduction, including discontinuation, of all antihypertensive medications by at least 50% for at least six months) in the definition of the primary endpoint means the maximum of all durations of consecutive months of reduction should be at least six months. The 50% reduction in the definition of the primary endpoint is determined separately for each baseline medication, based on the total daily dose of the antihypertensive medication(s) on the day of the first therapeutic dose. To meet the primary endpoint, a patient was required to meet the following criteria:</p><p> Receive an Imaging Dose  Receive at least one Therapeutic Dose  Have a reduction of each pre-therapeutic dosing (baseline) antihypertensive medication ≥50% for a minimum of six consecutive months beginning during the 12-Month Efficacy Phase of the study, during which no new, long-term antihypertensive medication is introduced and maintained for longer than 14 days.</p><p>The duration of the primary endpoint response began on the date during the 12-Month Efficacy Phase when all baseline antihypertensive medications reduced by at least 50% and any new medications are discontinued (the date post-therapeutic dosing when the reduction of the last antihypertensive medication reduced by at least 50% or the new medication is discontinued). The end date for which the duration of the ≥50% reduction of all antihypertensive medications was determined as the earlier of: a) the date that the patients no longer meets the criteria of having a ≥50% reduction of all baseline antihypertensive medications (i.e., the starting date of a new long-term continuing antihypertensive medication or a dose change in an existing regimen of antihypertensive medication that exceeds the ≥50% reduction of the baseline dose that is greater than 14 days in duration and continues without a reduction to the ≥50% level) OR b) the date of the patient's last applicable recorded study-related disposition date. If the patient had discontinued the study prior to the end of the 12-Month Efficacy Phase due to any of the following reasons:</p><p>• Withdrew consent The full analysis set (FAS) was defined as patients who received at least one therapeutic dose of 131 I-MIBG. The Per Protocol Set (PPS) is a subset of the Full Analysis Set, excluding patients who received only one therapeutic dose, who did not attend the 3 Month and 6 Month Efficacy Visits, or with major protocol violations. The Dosimetry Set and Safety Set include all patients who received the dosimetric dose of 131 I-MIBG. Per the SAP, the primary analysis of the primary endpoint was to calculate a point estimate with a two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) using the Agresti-Coull method. Assuming the proportion of patients experiencing a reduction (including discontinuation) of all antihypertensive medications by at least 50% for at least six months or two cycles was 0.25, a sample size of 58 would provide 90% power to exclude 10% at a one-sided significance level of 0.025. The trial was considered a success if the lower bound of the CI from the FAS analysis exceeded 0.10.</p><p>Tumor responses were required to be confirmed by repeat assessment at least 4 weeks after first meeting response criteria. Overall tumor response at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months per RECIST criteria were assessed centrally by independent, blinded readers. A frequency distribution table would be provided showing, by visit, target, non-target and overall response.</p><p>Adverse events were coded according to System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 19.1, and were graded according to the CTCAE v. 3.0. Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as AEs with onset date on or after the first administration of any amount of study drug to the end of 15 weeks after the administration of the last therapeutic dose of 131 I-MIBG. Incidences of TEAEs were summarized by maximum relationship to study drug and by maximum severity. Incidences of SAEs, hematologic AEs, and AESIs were also presented. In addition, all deaths and TEAEs resulting in study drug discontinuation were presented. Shift tables were prepared for laboratory parameters that had CTCAE v. 3 criteria. Incidences of potentially clinically significant abnormalities in ECG parameters were also provided.</p><p>Quality of life (QoL) was evaluated by the EORTC QLQ-C30 v.3. The data were summarized as follows: Global Health Status/Quality of Life, Functional Scales, and Symptom scales. The results of QoL and changes from baseline were summarized by visit and domain across the Full Analysis Set. A symptom response instrument was used to evaluate symptoms specific to NIH Quality of Life and Symptoms Questionnaire for Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma as a secondary endpoint. Changes in symptoms over time were evaluated by patients and across the FAS in aggregate. Changes in total doses of single medications to control tumor pain, and changes in pain medications, were evaluated by patient and across the FAS. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze overall survival (OS).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Reviewer's Comments:</head><p> OS was one of the secondary endpoints in Study MIP-IB12B. Because the analysis of a time to event endpoint is not interpretable in a single arm study, the OS result will not be evaluated in this review.  Besides evaluating the overall tumor response, duration of response should be evaluated as a measure of the antitumor activity. However, no plan for evaluation of duration of tumor response was provided in the protocol or the SAP.  QoL data were analyzed by the clinical and statistical reviewers; however, these analyses were considered exploratory in the context of a single-arm trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data</head><p>The SAP stated that no imputation of values for missing data would be performed in any primary analysis. Patients who received the dosimetric dose or a therapeutic dose but had no follow-up for safety were not included when computing percentages of patients experiencing adverse events or laboratory toxicities. Data that are potentially spurious or erroneous were examined using standard data management operating procedures, prior to database lock and statistical analysis.</p><p>Incomplete medication start and end dates were handled as follows: a missing start month was imputed as June, and a missing end month was imputed as December. Missing start and end dates were imputed as the last day of the month. If only the year was provided, the start date was imputed as June 30, and the end date was imputed as December 31. If the assignment of a missing start or end date conflicted with the available reported data, the assigned dates were modified. For antihypertensive medications, if the start year could not be determined, the medication was considered a baseline medication unless the end year was present and prior to the first therapeutic dose of 131 I-MIBG.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Compliance with Good Clinical Practices</head><p>The Applicant stated the following in the Study Report for Study MIP-IB12B (Module 5.3.5.2): "The Investigators agreed to conduct the study according to the principles of the ICH E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the ethical principles that have their origins in the Declaration of Helsinki. The Investigators conducted all aspects of this study in accordance with all national, state, and local laws or regulations. To ensure compliance, the Investigators agreed, by written consent to this protocol, to fully cooperate with compliance checks by allowing access to all study documentation by authorized individuals." DOP2 consulted the Office of Scientific Investigation (OSI) on July 28, 2017, to perform an audit of select clinical sites. Sites were selected primarily based on the number of patients enrolled, as the majority of patients for study MIP-IB12B were enrolled at 3 sites. These three domestic sites were chosen for inspection. In general, the inspectional findings supported validity of data as reported by the Applicant under this NDA. FDA form 483, with voluntary action indicated (VAI) was issued to the Applicant for failure to ensure proper monitoring of the study due to a gap of monitoring visits from 7/2013 through 4/2014. OSI concluded that although regulatory violations related to failure to ensure proper monitoring were noted, the observations are unlikely to significantly impact primary safety and efficacy analyses.</p><p>The facility which conducted central imaging review was recently inspected by OSI, therefore re-inspection of the site was deemed unnecessary.</p></div>

Eleven (16.2%) were 65 years or older, and no patients were 75 years or older. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Baseline Characteristics (e.g., disease characteristics, important concomitant drugs)</head><p>All patients had a diagnosis of malignant or relapsed/refractory pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma, and were ineligible for curative surgery. Most patients had one or more prior cancer therapies: 52.9% had prior radiation, 51.9% had prior drug or biologic therapy, and 88.2% had prior surgery. Approximately one third (30.9%) of patients received prior NA-131 I-MIBG therapy. Two patients (2.9%) had no prior therapy, 23.5% of patients (n=16) had surgery as their only prior therapy, and 4.4% of patients (n=3) had received chemotherapy or NA-131 I-MIBG therapy as their only prior therapy. Half of the patients (50%) had lung or liver metastases, and 60% had bone metastases.</p><p>Thirteen patients had a prior history of cancer. Two patients had a history of multiple cancers (basal cell carcinoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma; atypical carcinoid tumor, endometrial cancer). There were two cases each of basal cell carcinoma and neuroendocrine tumors, and one case each of the following: B-cell lymphoma, breast cancer, carcinoid tumor, colon cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, skin cancer, testicular cancer, and papillary thyroid carcinoma. Antihypertensive medications administered on the day following 131 I-MIBG administration are of special interest given the potential for hypertensive crisis with 131 I-MIBG administration. Five patients had a change in antihypertensive medication within 24 -48 hours of the first 131 I-MIBG therapeutic dose administration. All but one had an increase in the dose of an existing antihypertensive medication; one received a single intravenous dose of enalapril. The administration of increased doses of antihypertensive medications may indicate higher blood pressures, or health care provider anticipation of higher blood pressures, immediately following 131 I-MIBG administration. Section 8.2.4 contains a complete analysis of vital signs in patients receiving 131 I-MIBG. <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">Table 25</ref> summarizes the applicant's and the reviewer's analyses of the primary endpoint. Among the 68 patients who received at least one therapeutic dose of 131 I-MIBG, 17 (25%) had a reduction in the total dose of antihypertensive medications by at least 50% for at least 6 consecutive months. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Reviewer's Comments:</head><p>The study met the its primary objective because the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the primary endpoint was greater than 10%. The exact 95% CI: (16.0%, 35.9%) calculated by the statistical reviewer is consistent with the applicant's 95% CI obtained using the Agresti-Coull method specified in the SAP.</p><p>The applicant conducted two sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of the primary analysis result. In their sensitivity analysis 1, patients were considered non-responders if the 6 months of antihypertensive medication reduction was completed outside of the 12-month Efficacy Phase. While in sensitivity analysis 2, patients who began a new non-transient antihypertensive medication (i.e., used for more than 14 days) following therapeutic dosing were considered non-responders.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Reviewer's Comments:</head><p>The results of the two sensitivity analyses are consistent with the result of the primary analysis.</p><p>Among the 68 patients who received at least one therapeutic dose of 131 I-MIBG, there are 33 patients who attained at least 50% reduction in all antihypertensive medications. <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">Table 27</ref> summarizes the statistical reviewer's analysis of duration of response for those patients who attained at least 50% reduction in all antihypertensive medications.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Quality and Integrity</head><p>A study monitor maintained contact with the investigator and conducted initiation and closeout visits. The Applicant states that all data required by the protocol were reported accurately on the CRF and had to be consistent with other documents. Source documents were available for inspection. Data were captured using an electronic data capture (EDC); electronic case report forms (eCRFs) were designed for the capture of all relevant clinical data for the study. Quality control checks of documentation and data recording were carried out on behalf of the Applicant in accordance with standard operating procedures. Quality was assured through regular monitoring of the documentation, study center, facilities, and quality control (QC) audit of the database. To ensure collection of accurate and complete data, all eCRF data were the subject of 100% source data verification.</p><p>The quality of the data was sufficient to allow the statistical reviewer to reproduce the results of the primary analysis and other major submitted efficacy analyses. However, the result and data of duration of tumor response for patients whose best confirmed tumor response were CR NDA/BLA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 209607} {AZEDRA, 131 I-MIBG} 94 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) or PR were not included in the original NDA submission. This data was requested by FDA to understand consistency of the primary endpoint with traditional endpoints, e.g., overall tumor response and duration of response.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Results -Secondary and other relevant endpoints</head><p>Best confirmed overall tumor response was a secondary endpoint in Study MIP-IB12B. A confirmed response was defined as a response of CR, or PR that was confirmed by repeat assessment performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met. By the time of data cutoff for the analysis, there were 15 patients who had a PR. Among 15 responders, 13 had ongoing responses with durations ranging from 2.3+ to 9.4+ months. <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table  30</ref> summarizes the applicant's and reviewer's analyses of best confirmed overall tumor response and duration of response. The reviewer's result was based on the data of duration of response for patients whose best confirmed tumor response were CR or PR, which were requested by FDA.  Results and data related to duration of tumor response were not provided in the original NDA submission, and no plan for evaluation of duration of tumor response was provided in the protocol or the SAP. The applicant submitted the results of duration of response for patients whose best confirmed tumor response was CR or PR per FDA request. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">Table 24</ref>, there are discrepancies between the statistical reviewer's DOR results and the applicant's results. The discrepancies are due to the following reasons: To evaluate if the benefit of patients who met the primary endpoint can translate to the benefit of the tumor response, the statistical reviewer conducted two analyses to explore the relationship between patients who met the primary endpoint and the responders per RECIST.  On the other hand, 7 out of 15 responders who had a response by RECIST met the primary endpoint, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 32</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dose/Dose Response</head><p>Eighteen patients on study MIP-IB12B received only one therapeutic dose of 131 I-MIBG, and 50 patients received two therapeutic doses. A greater percentage (32%) of patients who received two doses demonstrated a response for the primary endpoint, compared to patients who received only one dose (5.6%). This analysis is limited by the small number of patients involved in each subgroup. In addition, additional confounding factors may be present; patients who had more aggressive disease may have progressed quickly and been unable to receive a second dose, for example. Limited conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of response by number of doses received.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Durability of Response</head><p>The duration of response in reduction of antihypertensive medications is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">Table  27</ref>: Duration of Response for Patients Who Attained at Least 50% Reduction in Antihypertensive Medications. Among primary endpoint responders (n=17), the median duration of reduction of antihypertensive medications by at least 50% was 13.3 months (range 8.0 -60.2 months). An additional 16 patients achieved an equivalent reduction in antihypertensive medications for a shorter period (median 1.79 months, range 0.1 -5.0 months). The duration of response, as determined by the primary endpoint, was sufficient to be considered of meaningful clinical benefit. The median duration of tumor response as measured by RECIST 1.0 was 8.7 months, with 40% of responders maintaining a response for at least 6 months (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">Table 24</ref>). The duration of tumor response as measured by RECIST was also considered clinically meaningful.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Persistence of Effect</head><p>As the treatment consisted of a defined number of doses, a discussion of persistence of effect is duplicative of the discussion of durability of response. See above. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Results -Secondary or exploratory COA (PRO) endpoints</head><p>The statistical reviewer conducted primary endpoint analyses in the subgroups defined by age (greater than 65, less than or equal to 65 years), gender (male, female), race (White vs. non-White) location of metastases and number of therapeutic doses. Because Study IB12B was conducted in US, subgroup analysis based on region is not applicable. <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 33</ref> summarizes the reviewer's analyses of subgroups.  <ref type="bibr">RECIST of 23.5% (n=51)</ref>, while response rates in African Americans and Asians were 14.3% (n=14) and 33.3% (n=3), respectively. Non-white patients also demonstrated decreases in blood pressure or in the use of antihypertensive medications, but did not meet the specific parameters defined by the primary endpoint. For example, One Asian patient had a temporary reduction in blood pressure medication use. Five African American patients had either decreases in blood pressure or decreases in blood pressure medications which did not qualify for the primary endpoint. Given the extremely small number of patients in some subgroups and the exploratory nature of these analyses, the response rates estimated for the primary endpoint alone are not expected to be predictive of clinical benefit by race.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Analyses Conducted on the Individual Trial</head><p>Not applicable. Patients were 18 years or older with metastatic or recurrent, iobenguane-avid PPGL. The study administered a dosimetric dose of 5 mCi 131 I-MIBG supplemented with 185 mcg of cold MIBG, followed by a single therapeutic dose of 6, 7, 8 or 9 mCi/kg 131 I-MIBG within 4 weeks of the dosimetric dose. The maximum dose administered was not to exceed that of a 75 kg patient.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Integrated Review of Effectiveness</head><p>Patients received saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI) to block thyroid uptake from 1 day pre-dose to 3 days post-dose. Tumor response was assessed using CT or MRI scans every 3 months for 1 year. Objective tumor response was evaluated by review by a blinded, independent review committee according to the RECIST criteria.</p><p>Safety was assessed by evaluation of treatment-emergent adverse events, electrocardiograms, physical examinations, vital signs, and laboratory assessments. Following the 12-month visit, patients entering a 1-year long-term follow-up phase to assess disease progression, overall survival, serious adverse events and late radiation toxicity at 18 and 24 months post-treatment. Tumor response data was collected per institutional standard during the long-term follow-up phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Endpoints</head><p>The primary endpoint was the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Ultratrace iobenguane I 131 in patients with malignant PPGL. Objective tumor response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) was evaluated as a secondary efficacy endpoint. The best overall response endpoint was defined as the best overall response recorded from the start of treatment until completion of the 12-month efficacy visit, disease progression or recurrence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis Plan</head><p>Standard descriptive statistics were presented. At 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post therapy, the proportion of patients who had overall tumor response CR or PR with a 95% confidence interval for the proportion was provided. All AEs observed were summarized by type, severity (by National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]), attribution, duration, and outcome.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol Amendments</head><p>There were 4 amendments to the original study protocol dated December 13, 2006. Important changes are summarized by amendment as follows:</p><p>Amendment 1  The definition of DLT was updated; DLTs were reviewed and adjudicated by a Dose Escalation Safety Cohort Committee.  An exclusion criterion also was added to exclude patients with evidence of altered biodistribution of Ultratrace iobenguane I 131 or evidence of renal obstruction. As well, the imaging assessment section was amended to state that patient-specific kidney measurements would be used for dosimetry estimates.  The drug administration section was updated to recommend the use of a drug infusion system developed by the sponsor for the therapeutic dose. The infusion system was developed to help reduce study drug administration variability between study centers.  The option of performing LTFU visits via telephone was removed. Only overall survival data could potentially be gathered via telephone.   The LTFU portion of the study was shortened from 5 years to 2 years following therapeutic dose administration (1 year following the efficacy phase).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Compliance with Good Clinical Practice</head><p>The Applicant stated the following in the CSR for Study MIP-IB12 (Module 5.3.5.2): "All considerations regarding the protection of human patients were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The investigator agreed to conduct the study according to the principles of the ICH E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the ethical principles that have their origins in the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. The investigator(s) conducted all aspects of this study in accordance with all national, state, and local laws or regulations. To ensure compliance, the investigator(s) agreed, by written consent to this protocol, to fully cooperate with compliance checks by allowing access to all study documentation by authorized individuals."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Disclosure</head><p>In accordance with 21 CFR 54, the Applicant submitted a financial disclosure certification document in module 1.3.4. The document includes a table listing all investigators who participated in the four studies supporting NDA 209607. Only sites, and corresponding investigators, which accrued patients on studies are included. Box 3 is checked on Form 3454, which states that the Applicant has not entered into any financial arrangements with the listed clinical investigators whereby the value of compensation to the investigator could be affected by the outcome of the study as defined in 21 CFR 54.2(a). The text under box 3, Form 3454, further states that the investigators were required to disclose whether they had a proprietary interest in the product or a significant equity in the Applicant as defined in 21 CFR 54.2(b), and that no clinical investigator disclosed such interests, and that no listed investigator was the recipient of significant payments of other sorts as defined in CFR 54.2(f).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient Disposition</head><p>Twenty-four patients were enrolled, and twenty-one patients were treated (ITT population). Fourteen of the treated patients (67%) completed the 12-month efficacy phase. Reasons for discontinuation during the efficacy phase include receipt of an alternative anticancer therapy (n=4), death (n=3), and other (n=1). Ten patients completed the Month 24 assessment, and six patients were followed until 3 years post-treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol Deviations</head><p>A complete listing of protocol deviations for the study was provided. The majority of protocol deviations were related to missed protocol assessments or assessments which occurred outside of the specified window. Five patients did not receive the specified schedule of SSKI drops; this was considered a minor deviation. Organ dosimetry did not occur for one patient, because the patient did not have an imaging standard present during the whole-body imaging sessions. The remainder of the protocol deviations were reviewed, and do not appear to substantially impact the integrity of the study or the reliability of the study results for conducting the safety and efficacy reviews.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographic Characteristics</head><p>The median age of patients at enrollment was 49 (range 30 -72). Thirteen (61.9%) were male and 8 (38.1%) were female. Two (9.5%) were Asian, 3 (14.3%) were African American, and 16 (76.2%) were white. Ten (47.6%) had a primary diagnosis of pheochromocytoma and eleven (52.4%) had a diagnosis of paraganglioma.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Results</head><p>As noted above, the primary endpoint of this study was determination of the MTD. Assessment of efficacy through determination of overall response by RECIST v 1.0 was a secondary endpoint. Four of 21 patients (19%, 95% CI 0.00, 0.38) in the ITT population achieved a response of PR; there were no CRs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.4">Assessment of Efficacy Across Trials</head><p>The efficacy of 131 I-MIBG is supported primarily by Study MIP-IB12B, with supporting evidence derived from the dose-escalation study MIP-IB12.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary Endpoints</head><p>The primary endpoint of Study MIP-IB12B, reduction of antihypertensive medications by 50% for a duration of 6 months, is a new endpoint considered specifically for the treatment of patients with PPGL. The endpoint was chosen, and agreed upon by FDA, as a measure of antitumor activity of 131 I-MIBG by means of detecting a reduction in hypertension, which is a key contributor to morbidity associated with PPGL. Severe hypertension in patients with PPGL is caused by the underlying tumor; however, to provide evidence that 131 I-MIBG demonstrates anti-tumor activity, and not merely antihypertensive activity, the response in the primary endpoint was supported by an established response criteria, radiologic response by RECIST v1.0.</p><p>As discussed in section 8.1.2 MIP-IB12B Study Results, 25% of patients in study MIP-IB12B achieved a 50% reduction in antihypertensive medications for at least 6 months. The duration of response, as determined by the primary endpoint, was sufficient to be considered of meaningful clinical benefit. Among primary endpoint responders (n=17), the median duration of reduction of antihypertensive medications by at least 50% was 13.3 months (range 8.0 -60.2 months). An additional 16 patients achieved an equivalent reduction in antihypertensive medications for a shorter period (median 1.79 months, range 0.1 -5.0 months). As a high degree of morbidity in PPGL arises from the complications of hypertension, this represents a significant clinical benefit; however, this does not definitively indicate that this benefit is NDA/BLA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 209607} {AZEDRA, 131 I-MIBG} 102 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) achieved through treatment of the tumor, and thus, additional evidence in the form of radiologic response was also considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary and Other Endpoints</head><p>In Studies MIP-IB12B and MIP-IB12, response as evaluated by RECIST v1.0 was a secondary objective. Among all patients treated with 131 I-MIBG on Study MIP-IB12B, 22.1% (95% CI: 13.6 -32.7%) demonstrated a response by RECIST; these responses were maintained for a median of 8.7 months. In Study MIP-IB12, 4/21 patients (19%, 95% CI: 0 -38%) demonstrated a partial response. In Study MIP-IB12B, not all primary endpoint responders were also responders by RECIST; 41% of responders by the primary endpoint achieved a response of PR, and the remainder experienced a best response of SD. The clinical meaningfulness of achieving a radiologic response of stable disease in this population is unclear, as PPGL may be slowgrowing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subpopulations</head><p>Exploratory subgroup analyses were performed with regards to response by the primary endpoint in Study MIP-IB12B. The subpopulation analyses are limited by the small size of the study, and by the post-hoc nature of these analyses. A significantly greater percent of responders to the primary endpoint were among those patients who received two doses of 131 I-MIBG; 5% (1/18) of patients who received one dose of 131 I-MIBG demonstrated a response, compared to 32% of patients (16/50) who received two doses. This finding could indicate that the higher cumulative dose is associated with improved response, or merely that patients with more severe disease and correspondingly poor performance status were less likely to recover sufficiently to receive the second dose. Given the small sample size, limited conclusions can be drawn from this finding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Efficacy Considerations</head><p>Overall survival (OS) was evaluated in Study MIP-IB12B as a secondary endpoint. Given the inability to interpret OS results in a single arm trial, an analysis of this measure is not included in this review. Additional secondary efficacy endpoints, such as tumor marker response and patient-reported outcome measures, were also included in the study as secondary endpoints but not analyzed as part of the efficacy evaluation given the unclear reliability in assessing clinical benefit.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.1">Safety Review Approach</head><p>The safety of I 131 -MIBG in PPGL was primarily evaluated in 68 patients in study MIP-IB12B who received at least one therapeutic dose of I 131 -MIBG. Fifty patients received the planned two therapeutic doses and 18 patients received one therapeutic dose, which consisted of 500 mCi or 8 mg/kg for patients weighing less than 62.5 kilograms. In total, 74 patients received a dosimetric dose. Database lock occurred after 68 patients completed the 12-month efficacy evaluation (12 months from first therapeutic dose). At the time of database lock, 18 patients remained in long term follow-up (LTFU). An additional 11 patients were enrolled on an expanded access study for study MIP-IB12B, which provided treatment identical to the treatment described above.</p><p>Twenty-one patients who received one dosimetric and one therapeutic dose of I 131 -MIBG in study MIP-IB12 were also analyzed. Patients received 6, 7, 8 or 9 mCi/kg I 131 -MIBG based on assigned dose cohort. Patients were followed during a 12-month efficacy phase and subsequent 1-year LTFU phase. In total, between studies MIP-IB12 and MIP-IB12B, 88 unique patients received at least one therapeutic dose. Of note, one patient (MIP-IB11-/ MIP-IB12B-) received therapeutic doses on both studies MIP-IB12 and MIP-IB12B. One additional patient enrolled on both studies MIP-IB12 and MIP-IB12B (MIP-IB12 /MIP-IB12B ), but did not receive a therapeutic dose on MIP-IB12B, and therefore is not duplicated in the main safety population.</p><p>The Applicant provided additional safety information in the 90-day safety update regarding the 18 patients remaining on study MIP-IB12B, and patients enrolled on the MIP-IB12B Expanded Access Program (n=11). This information was not included in calculations of adverse event incidences, but all serious adverse events were reviewed, and several key adverse events included in the 90-day update are discussed in this review.</p><p>A pooled population of patients (N= 118) was analyzed by the Applicant as the main safety population, and included patients from study MIP-IB11 and MIP-IB13 in addition to MIP-IB12 and MIP-IB12B. Though included in the analysis provided by the Applicant, studies MIP-IB11 and MIP-IB13 were excluded from the primary pooled safety analysis by this reviewer. Study MIP-IB11 administered only a dosimetric dose of 5mCi 131 I-MIBG with 185 mcg cold MIBG, and thus would not be expected to provide meaningful safety information regarding administration of therapeutic doses of 131 I-MIBG. Study MIP-IB13 administered 131 I-MIBG to patients with refractory neuroblastoma, a substantially different patient population; in addition, patients received significantly higher doses of 131 I-MIBG (dosimetric dose of 0.1 mCi/kg 131 I-MIBG with 185 mcg cold MIBG, followed by a 11.2, 15.5, or 18.2 mCi/kg therapeutic dose 7-28 days later), and all received autologous stem cell rescue. The follow-up period for this study was 60 days, thus precluding comprehensive collection of expected late radiation toxicities.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.2">Review of the Safety Database</head><p>Overall Exposure 131 I-MIBG was administered by infusion in a monitored setting. In the safety population (MIP-IB12 and MIP-IB12B), 88 patients received at least one therapeutic dose in addition to the dosimetric dose. Forty-nine patients (55.6%) received two therapeutic doses. One patient enrolled on both Study MIP-IB12 and MIP-IB12B, and received a total of three therapeutic doses. The administered activity in the safety population ranged from 107.4 mCi to 1101.59 mCi, with a median of 897.1 mCi. The administered activity in Study MIP-IB12B ranged from 101.5 mCi to 1095.8 mCi, with a median of 984.8 mCi. On Study MIP-IB12B, one patient received a significantly lower dose than the proposed dose of 500 mCi or 8 mCi/kg for patients &lt;62.5 kg. This patient's extensive disease prevented an accurate dosimetry calculation and a lower dose of 101.5 mCi (1.8 mCi/kg) was given rather than the body-weight based dose of 8 mCi/kg (442 mCi). This patient withdrew from the study prior to receipt of a second dose. Although 8 other patients received doses &lt;500 mCi/kg, these patients either received doses within 10% of the recommended dose of 500 mCi or were administered an appropriate body weight-based dose. The study required dose reduction of the second dose in patients who experienced severe hematologic toxicity. Seven patients met criteria for dose reductions due to hematologic or renal toxicity, though five patients did not receive the protocol-required dose reductions. The safety population from Studies MIP-IB12B and MIP-IB12 consisted of patients with malignant pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma who were ineligible for curative surgery for PPGL, and either failed a prior therapy for PPGL, or were not candidates for chemotherapy. Consistent with the epidemiology and natural history of PPGL, the median age was 54 years. Approximately 15.7% (N=14) of patients were over the age of 65, and none were over the age of 75. The Applicant provided subgroup safety analyses to evaluate the impact of age on adverse event frequency in Study MIP-IB12B and the pooled population. Additional exploratory analyses were conducted based on gender, race, ethnicity, and history of prior treatment with NA 131 I-MIBG. Limitations of these subgroup analyses are the small sample sizes and lack of internal control in both studies</p></div>

Issues identified included: missing standard toxicity grade for 187 events in Study MIP-12B; missing end date or start date for some adverse events in all studies; missing records in Inclusion/Exclusion criteria domain for some screen failures in studies 12, 12B, and 13; missing reference range variables for some laboratory records in all studies; and inconsistent value for standard units for some tests in Studies 11 and 13. These issues did not substantially affect the ability of the reviewer to conduct a thorough safety review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Categorization of Adverse Events</head><p>The Applicant coded verbatim AE terms for Study MIP-IB12B and the integrated database using MedDRA version 19.0 for the primary analyses. Study MIP-IB12 was coded using MedDRA version 10.0. Adverse events in the ISS are coded using MedDRA 19.0. Adverse events in the ISS ADAE dataset match 100% to MedDRA 19.0. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as defined as AEs with onset dates on or after the dosimetric dose date to 15 weeks after the administration of the last therapeutic dose of 131 I-MIBG. Notably, the definition of NDA/BLA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 209607} {AZEDRA, 131 I-MIBG} 106 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) TEAE used in IB12B was different from that used in the ISS, in which TEAEs are defined as AEs with onset dates on or after the date of the (first) dosimetric dose. AEs of special interest (AESIs) were defined as any serious or non-serious event of scientific or medical concern specific to 131 I-MIBG reported on or beyond 16 weeks after the last therapeutic dose, and known to be associated with long-term radiation toxicity. CTCAE Version 3.0 was used for toxicity grading.</p><p>The OCS review assessed the adequacy of the Applicant's mapping of AE verbatim terms to MedDRA preferred terms (PTs) for the Study MIP-IB12B primary dataset. Of the 219 distinct reported terms in the dataset, the reviewer used matching of identical verbatim and MedDRA PTs (n=85 terms) as well as manual evaluation of the remaining verbatim terms (n=134 terms). Most nonidentical terms were due to spelling differences (e.g., anemia versus anaemia), abbreviations and full text (WBC vs. white blood cell) and verbatim terms that included descriptors (e.g., slight weakness versus weakness/asthenia). Overall, the MedDRA PTs listed in the dataset adequately represented the verbatim terms from the CRFs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Routine Clinical Tests</head><p>In study MIP-IB12B, baseline evaluations included history and physical examination with vital signs, laboratory evaluations (chemistry, complete blood count, urinalysis, thyroid function testing), renal function testing (glomerular filtration rate or 24-hour creatinine clearance), tumor markers, and imaging. Vital signs were recorded within 4 hours prior and 4 hours following each 131 I-MIBG administration. Twelve-lead ECGs were obtained at the time of dosimetric dose (prior to, up to 2 minutes post dose, and at 10, 15, and 20 minutes post dose, then within 15 minutes prior to the second and third I 131 Iobenguane imaging scans) and within 7 days after each therapeutic dose, and 24-hour Holter monitor evaluation was performed at the time of therapeutic dose administration. Pregnancy testing was done at baseline and within 48 hours prior to each dosimetric or therapeutic dose. Blood pressure and heart rate assessment, as well as hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis, were performed weekly during weeks 2-24 post therapeutic dose monthly during months 7-12. Blood pressure and heart rate were also collected twice weekly in the first 6 weeks after each therapeutic dose. Thyroid function was repeated at month 12 and renal function testing was repeated at months 6 and 12. Clinical evaluation for dry mouth was performed at 12 months. Long-term follow-up evaluations performed every 6 months included tumor markers and a CT or MRI of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, but were not required to include laboratory monitoring or physical examination. However, adverse events of special interest (AESIs), which includes events identifying potential late radiation toxicity, were collected during LTFU. The monitoring for immediate and long-term adverse effects was adequate.</p><p>In study MIP-IB12, similar evaluations were performed, though the study administered only one therapeutic dose, and the long-term follow-up period, as defined in the most recent amendment, was 1 year after the initial 12-month efficacy phase (2 years total). Vital signs were taken 15 minutes prior to and 15 minutes after each infusion, and within 15 minutes prior to the Day 2-4 scan; blood pressure was not measured on a twice weekly or weekly basis as in NDA/BLA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 209607} {AZEDRA, 131 I-MIBG} 107 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) Study MIP-IB12B. Laboratory analyses were performed on a similar schedule. The monitoring for immediate side effects in this study is adequate; as the long-term follow-up period was revised to 1 year in the amended protocol, information on late radiation effects is necessarily limited in this study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deaths</head><p>There were 36 deaths among the 88 patients who received a therapeutic dose of 131 I-MIBG on Study MIP-IB12B and Study MIP-IB12. Two of these patients had discontinued Study MIP-IB12 to receive other treatment at the time of death. There were 4 deaths in patients who received 131 I-MIBG on Study MIP-IB13, none of which were related to treatment, and no deaths on Study MIP-IB11.</p><p>Twenty-three of the 36 deaths in the MIP-IB12/MIP-IB12B safety population were attributed to disease progression. Ten deaths were attributed to adverse events not attributed to 131 I-MIBG, and included hepatic failure due to metastatic pheochromocytoma, spinal disorder, thalamic infarction, intestinal perforation leading to sepsis, metastatic colon cancer, pulmonary embolism, peripheral arterial ischemia, sepsis, pneumonia, and metabolic acidosis. Most adverse events leading to death were attributed to complications from metastatic disease.</p><p>Reviewer note: The safety narratives for all deaths were reviewed and additional information was requested when the assessment of causality was unclear. Except as noted below, this reviewer agrees with the assessment of causality listed by the Applicant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient MIP-IB12</head><p>experienced hepatic failure which the Applicant attributed to metastatic pheochromocytoma. Elevated AST and alkaline phosphatase were first documented 1 month after infusion of the patient's only dose of 131 I-MIBG. The patient experienced hypoglycemia and bleeding (note that the patient was on anticoagulation therapy), and reported a 30-to 45pound weight loss over the past few months. One month after the initial presentation, she was found unresponsive and admitted with hepatic encephalopathy; during admission, liver imaging demonstrated multiple hepatic masses with right portal vein reversal of flow. She was later diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and treated for sepsis and acute organ failure. Despite aggressive treatment, the patient continued to decline, with metabolic acidosis, persistent thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. Ventilator support was withdrawn, and the patient died the following day. The Applicant stated that a role of 131 I-MIBG could not be completely ruled out, but stated that the patient's urosepsis and acute organ failure precipitated the death.</p><p>Reviewer note: The patient experienced hepatic failure after receipt of a therapeutic dose of 131 I-MIBG, though the case is confounded by apparently progressive metastatic liver disease. The event of sepsis and acute organ failure appears to be the ultimate cause of death, though underlying liver failure likely contributed. Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) One cause of death (patient MIP-IB12B-) was listed as "hematologic decompensation" or "blood disorder" which occurred 1.5 years following treatment with one therapeutic dose of 131 I-MIBG. The patient received one therapeutic dose of 131 I-MIBG on study in and had severe hematologic toxicity precluding administration of a second dose. The Applicant states that the patient demonstrated slow recovery of bone marrow function. She was later treated with NA-131 I-MIBG by her physician off-study in . The patient developed severe hematologic toxicity including Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, Grade 3 anemia and Grade 3 leukopenia. The patient died after a complicated 41-day hospital stay; the cause of death was described by a family member as "full blown hematologic decompensation." The Principal Investigator made several attempts to obtain additional information from the treating physician and hospital regarding this case without response. The event was considered related to the patient's off-protocol therapy and not related to study therapy.</p><p>Reviewer note: An information request was sent to the Applicant to request additional information about this patient, as the case raises suspicion of an additional case of myelodysplastic syndrome. However, records of the patient's subsequent off-protocol treatment were unable to be obtained. Without additional information, it is most reasonable to attribute the patients' decompensation and death to the additional off-study therapy with 131 I-MIBG.</p><p>Two patients died due to therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, n=1) or acute myeloid leukemia (n=1). These cases were attributed to treatment with 131 I-MIBG. Additional cases of MDS and leukemia were non-fatal; a complete discussion of the incidence treatmentrelated MDS/AML is found in section 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Serious Adverse Events</head><p>There were 142 serious adverse events which occurred in 60 patients in the Study MIP-IB12B and MIP-IB12 Safety Population. Forty-seven (47, 33.1%) were assessed by the Applicant as related (including possibly or probably related) to treatment. Two were fatal, related to AML and MDS (see discussion in section 0). The most common SAE was disease progression. The most common related SAEs by system organ class were blood and lymphatic system disorders (anemia, febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia; N=29) followed by neoplasms (ALL, AML, MDS, N=5). Other SAEs assessed by the Applicant as related to the study product included dehydration (N=3), pulmonary embolism (N=2), hypothyroidism (N=1), constipation (N=1), dyskinesia (N=1), dyspnea (N=1), Aspartate aminotransferase increased (N=1) and acute cholangitis (N=1).</p><p>This reviewer reviewed all SAE narratives to assess potential relation to investigational product. Attention was paid to reported adverse events associated with NA-131 I-MIBG in the literature, including myelosuppression, treatment-related leukemia or MDS, hypothyroidism, pulmonary toxicity, renal toxicity, and liver toxicity.</p></div>

The patient subsequently entered the long-term follow-up phase.</p><p>Reviewer comment: The event of cholangitis is attributed to the study medication; however, the patient's sickle cell anemia is a predisposing factor for cholecystitis and the development of acute cholangitis, and may be a contributing factor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MIP-IB12B-</head><p>: pulmonary embolism, Grade 4 A 57-year-old black male with metastatic pheochromocytoma and history of notable for obesity, hypertension, and prior thrombus of the tibial vein, developed a pulmonary embolism approximately 6 weeks after receipt of the first therapeutic dose of 131 I-MIBG. The patient received enoxaparin prophylaxis given his history of prior thrombus and thrombocytosis recognized prior to receipt of 131 I-MIBG. The investigator assessed the event as possibly related to 131 I-MIBG given the temporal relationship.</p><p>Reviewer comment: Multiple confounding factors, including prior history of thrombus, obesity, and underlying malignancy, likely contributed to the event.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MIP-IB12B-</head><p>: pulmonary embolism, Grade 4 A 56-year-old white male with pheochromocytoma metastatic to mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, also with paraplegia, diabetes, and dyslipidemia developed a right lower lobe pulmonary embolism 3 months after receiving his only therapeutic dose of 131 I-MIBG. The event was attributed as related to the study medication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer comment: Multiple confounding factors, including the patient's widely metastatic disease, vascular risk factors, and paraplegia, likely contributed to the event.</head><p>MIP-IB12B-: dyskinesia, Grade 3 A 59-year-old white male with a right adrenal pheochromocytoma developed involuntary movements of his left arm approximately 16 days after receiving the first therapeutic dose of 131 I-MIBG; the event recurred and prompted hospitalization, during which time it was noted that the patients' blood pressure was fluctuating greatly, with measurements of 99-185 systolic and 69 -94 diastolic. A workup including MRI, CT, and ECG did not demonstrate a definitive etiology of the neurologic symptoms, and it was hypothesized that the blood pressure fluctuation was responsible for the neurologic symptoms. Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) Reviewer comment: Catecholamine-related cardiovascular events such as hypertension are well-documented in the literature following administration of NA-131 I-MIBG in patients with pheochromocytoma. This reviewer agrees with the assessment of causality as potentially related to the study medication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MIP-IB12B-</head><p>: Dyspnea, Grade 4; aspartate aminotransferase increased, Grade 3 A 67-year-old white male with pheochromocytoma metastatic to the lung, liver, and bone, and history of diabetes, right nephrectomy, as well as baseline dyspnea developed Grade 4 dyspnea the day following infusion of 131 I-MIBG; Grade 3 AST elevation was noted during the hospitalization, and improved during the hospitalization. The patient also developed lower extremity edema and renal injury. The patient's renal injury was attributed to diuresis in the setting of presumed congestive heart failure and volume overload, and peripheral edema related to lymphatic obstruction due to abdominal tumor burden. Imaging demonstrated widely metastatic progressive disease.</p><p>Reviewer comment: Though the events are attributed to 131 I-MIBG, the case is highly confounded and the patient's underlying medical condition could have contributed to the observed serious adverse events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MIP-IB12B EAP_</head><p>: Pneumonitis, Grade 5; pulmonary embolism, Grade 3 A 69-year-old male with metastatic pheochromocytoma enrolled in the MIP-IB12B Expanded Access Program (EAP) developed pneumonitis and a pulmonary embolism 9 weeks after receiving a single dose (521.9 mCi) of 131 I-MIBG. The patient was treated with steroids as well as antifungal, antiviral, and antibiotic medications, and was placed on a ventilator. A CT scan demonstrated a ground-glass appearance throughout both lungs with focal areas of consolidation deemed most likely of infectious etiology per the narrative provided by the Applicant. The patient did not have evidence of pulmonary metastatic disease. The patient subsequently developed a right pneumothorax and deteriorated. Twelve days after the initial diagnosis of pneumonitis, the patient developed hypotension and asystole during a central line replacement, and was unable to be resuscitated. An autopsy was not performed. The investigator assessed the event of pneumonitis as related to study drug, and the Applicant assessed the event as possibly related. Pulmonary embolism was assessed by the Applicant as possibly related, and pneumothorax was assessed as not related. Reviewer note: This reviewer agrees with the assessment of the event of pneumonitis as possibly related to 131 I-MIBG. Serious lung toxicity including acute respiratory distress syndrome and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia has been described in the acute and subacute setting in relation to NA-131 I-MIBG therapy in the literature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref> Radiation therapy in general is also known to cause pneumonitis. As noted in regard to previously discussed cases, there is not a recognized mechanism for the development of pulmonary embolism as a direct result of 131 I-MIBG therapy, and the patient's metastatic cancer poses a clear risk factor. This case occurred on the MIP-IB12B EAP; as such, the event is not included in summary tabulations of adverse events which occurred in the MIP-IB12B/MIP-IB12 safety population. Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) Serious pulmonary adverse events were identified in a small number of patients in the primary safety population and one patient in the expanded access program (MIP-IB12B EAP_ , pneumonitis). Reported preferred terms included acute respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, dyspnea, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. With the exception of the case of pneumonitis already discussed which occurred in the expanded access program, these cases were attributed to disease (lung metastases associated with pneumothorax or malignant pleural effusion) or distinct diseaserelated processes (worsening of congestive heart failure, acute-on-chronic respiratory failure, infectious process). Given the presence of additional disease processes that may account for the observed pulmonary events, this reviewer agrees with the assessment that these cases of severe pulmonary adverse events are unlikely to be related to the study product.</p><p>Two cases of acute renal failure were reported as serious adverse events; both events were Grade 3 and demonstrated recovery. Neither was assessed as related to the study product, and both were associated with confounding factors (hypertensive urgency and diuresis) that render attribution to 131 I-MIBG unlikely. Renal failure is a concern based on published literature of NA-131 I-MIBG, and an integrated analysis of renal toxicity in the safety population is found in section 8.2.5. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dropouts and/or Discontinuations Due to Adverse Effects</head><p>As only one therapeutic dose was administered in Study MIP-IB12, a discussion of therapeutic discontinuation is not meaningful, and this discussion is confined to study MIP-IB12B. As discussed in Patient Disposition, Section 0, 18 of 68 patients (26.5%) in this study received only one therapeutic dose. Reasons for discontinuation during the efficacy phase included progressive disease (n=6), adverse events (n=8), death (n=3), lost to follow-up (n=2) and receipt of an alternative anticancer therapy (n=4). Adverse events causing discontinuation prior to the second therapeutic dose were primarily hematologic toxicities, and included thrombocytopenia (n=2), anemia (n=2), decreased white blood cells (n=2), nausea and vomiting (n=1), and multiple hematologic adverse events (thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, hemolytic anemia; n=1). Causes of death which prevented continued trial participation included renal failure secondary to disease/ascites (n=1), metabolic acidosis (n=1), and bowel perforation (n=1). Twenty-nine patients discontinued the study during the long-term follow-up phase; reasons included death (n=2), adverse events (n=6), progressive disease (n=10), receipt of an alternative anticancer therapy (n=8) and patient withdrawal of consent (n=3). Causes of death during long-term follow-up included progressive disease (n=4), acute myeloid leukemia (n=1), and "hematologic decompensation" (n=1). Please see discussion of these cases under Section 8.4.1. Adverse events causing discontinuation during long-term follow-up included myelodysplastic syndrome (n=1) and metastatic colon cancer (n=1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significant Adverse Events</head><p>Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were defined as AEs that are related to the acute and chronic effects of radiation toxicity seen at any time post dosimetric dose during the study. The Applicant defined AESIs using an extensive list of adverse events, notably endocrine (hypothyroidism), gastrointestinal (abdominal pain, malabsorption), genitourinary (elevated creatinine, elevated urea, renal failure), hepatic (elevated liver function tests, hepatic insufficiency), malignancies (sarcomas, leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome), and pulmonary (bronchiolitis, pulmonary fibrosis). Additional preferred terms, such as those representing salivary gland toxicities (dry mouth, salivary gland pain, salivary gland enlargement) and additional renal toxicities (kidney fibrosis, proteinuria, and glomerular filtration rate decreased) were added by this reviewer.</p><p>Hypothyroidism occurred in 3 patients (3.4%); all patients were treated with iodine for thyroid protection. One case occurred within the first month of treatment in a patient previously treated with NA-131 I-MIBG. The remaining cases occurred 108 and 536 days after administration of the first therapeutic dose of 131 I-MIBG.</p><p>Myelosuppression was common following administration of 131 I-MIBG; blood count nadirs (median) occurred 4 -8 weeks following administration of therapeutic doses of 131 I-MIBG. The median time to platelet count nadir was 4.3 weeks following therapeutic dose 1 and 5 weeks for therapeutic dose 2. Median times to neutrophil count and hemoglobin nadir were 5.4 weeks and 6.7 weeks, respectively following therapeutic dose 1; following therapeutic dose 2, the median times to nadir were 6 weeks and 8 weeks, respectively. The median time to recovery from nadir was 2.1 weeks for platelets and neutrophils following therapeutic dose 1, and approximately 3 weeks following therapeutic dose 2. On Study MIP-IB12B, 24% (n=16) of patients received one or more red blood cell transfusion during the study (1 -6 transfusions), and 16% (n=11) of patients received platelet transfusions (1 -5 transfusions per patient). Approximately 9% (n=6) of patients received granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and 3% (n=2) received erythropoietin.</p><p>Two new primary solid malignancies have been diagnosed in patients exposed to 131 I-MIBG; this excludes a patient who was diagnosed with bladder cancer during screening. One patient, a 56year-old female, developed adenocarcinoma of the lung 815 days (&gt;2 years) after administration of the first therapeutic dose of 131 I-MIBG; prior therapy included only surgical resection, and she received 2 doses of 131 I-MIBG on study. The event of metastatic colon cancer, which occurred in a different 54-year-old female, was recorded 551 days (18 months) after administration of the first therapeutic dose; the patient who experienced this event also developed myelodysplastic syndrome (diagnosed within months of the diagnosis of colon NDA/BLA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 209607} {AZEDRA, 131 I-MIBG} 115 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) cancer). The patient's prior therapy included resection, 3 rounds of EBRT as well as doxorubicin. The patient received two therapeutic doses of 131 I-MIBG on study.</p><p>Secondary malignancies in patients who have received 131 I-MIBG are reported in the literature, and largely consist of myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia (see section <ref type="bibr">8.2.5)</ref>. The case of adenocarcinoma of the lung occurred in a patient who did not have prior treatment-related risk factors such as radiation; it is unclear whether additional risk factors such as smoking were present. Non-small cell lung cancer has not been reported in the literature among patients who have received 131 I-MIBG according to literature searches performed by the Applicant and by this reviewer, though a theoretical risk remains given the radiation exposure associated with the product. 131 I-MIBG could potentially have contributed to the development of the case of colon cancer described above, though, similarly, this second malignancy is not reported in the literature. However, the latter patient's prior therapy with multiple courses of radiation is the more likely culprit.</p><p>Factors limiting the analysis of secondary malignancy with 131 I-MIBG include the small population studied and limited follow-up. Study MIP-IB12 did not include long-term follow-up, thus second malignancy data is available primarily for patients treated on study MIP-IB12B (n=68). In addition, discontinuations due to progressive disease or for other reasons limited collection of long-term adverse event data; while a 5-year long-term follow-up was intended, the median duration of follow-up for patients on study MIP-IB12B was 1.6 years. While the lack of long-term follow-up data could artificially lower the estimate of secondary malignancies associated with 131 I-MIBG, the heavily pre-treated population could lead to overestimation of the incidence of secondary malignancies due to 131 I-MIBG. The incidence of second malignancies in patients receiving 131 I-MIBG should therefore be followed prospectively to attain a more accurate understanding of this risk. Renal failure (preferred terms "renal failure" and "renal failure acute") was observed in 6.8% (n=6) of patients in the MIP-IB12/MIP-IB12B safety population, demonstrated in <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 37</ref>: Cases of Renal Failure in the MIP-IB12/MIP-IB12B Safety Population. Of these cases, 2 were assessed as related to the study product (event Grades 1 and 2). Of these cases, one (a Grade 2 event which occurred 22 days after treatment) was not resolved and resulted in a dose reduction. Among the cases assessed as not related to 131 I-MIBG, two were Grade 3. Narratives for these events were reviewed and this reviewer agrees with the Applicant's assessment that these cases were likely not related to 131 I-MIBG, as significant confounding factors (hypotension, concomitant medications, progressive disease) existed. Four of the six cases occurred in patients with baseline impairment in GFR (&lt;90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ).</p><p>Among the additional reported renal adverse events, several (glomerular filtration rate decreased, hematuria) have a potential relationship to radiation toxicity. Renal fibrosis is a potential complication of radiation exposure; however, the narrative provided by the Applicant for the event kidney fibrosis suggests that this condition pre-dated administration of 131 I-MIBG. This reviewer agrees with that assessment. It is notable that several patients experienced a decrease in GFR that was not reported as an adverse event, thus the incidence of "glomerular filtration rate decreased" indicated in the table above, based on dataset analysis, is incorrect. A discussion of these findings is found later in this review, Section 8.2.4: Laboratory Analyses. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment Emergent Adverse Events and Adverse Reactions</head><p>Treatment emergent adverse events were consistent with the expected adverse events associated with 131 I-MIBG based on prior experience with NA-131 I-MIBG and experience with other radiotherapeutics. The gastrointestinal adverse events observed could be associated with the product (as suspected in the case of nausea and vomiting) or with the underlying disease (in the cases of constipation and abdominal pain), or both. Myelosuppression was common, with a delayed onset as discussed in detail above. Salivary gland toxicity was also common, with 40.1% of patients experiencing symptoms of sialoadenitis and 47.7% of patients experiencing dry mouth. Myelosuppression and sialoadenitis are recognized adverse events associated with NA 131 I-MIBG based on published experience. a Fatigue is a composite term and includes "fatigue" and "asthenia." b Sialoadenitis is a composite term and includes "sialoadenitis," "salivary gland pain," and "salivary gland enlargement." c Abdominal pain includes the preferred terms "abdominal pain," abdominal pain upper," and "abdominal pain lower." d Hypertension includes "blood pressure increased" and "hypertension." e Renal failure includes preferred terms "renal failure" and "renal failure acute".</p><p>An analysis of treatment-emergent adverse events by number of therapeutic doses administered was conducted. At the system organ class level, the incidence of most TEAEs was comparable between patients who received one dose compared to those who received two doses. The exception was in the class 'infections and infestations,' which occurred in 38.5% of patients who received one dose and 64.0% of patients who received two doses; this difference is likely related to the increased total duration of myelosuppression experienced by patients who received two doses of 131 I-MIBG. The most common infections experienced included urinary tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, candida infection, and sinusitis.</p><p>As expected, a greater percentage of patients who received two doses of 131 I-MIBG experienced cytopenias (preferred terms: thrombocytopenia, anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia). A greater percentage of patients who received two doses of 131 I-MIBG also experienced sialoadenitis (48% vs. 33.3%, preferred terms: sialoadenitis, salivary gland pain, and salivary gland enlargement). Renal failure (preferred terms: renal failure and renal failure acute) was also more common amongst patients who received two doses of 131 I-MIBG (10% vs. 2.6%). There was no significant difference in the development of hypothyroidism (4% vs. 2.6%). All patients (100%) who developed leukemia or MDS had received two doses of 131 I-MIBG on study. The analysis of adverse events by number of doses of 131 I-MIBG administered confirmed an increased incidence of sialoadenitis, renal failure, cytopenias, MDS and leukemias.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Laboratory Findings</head><p>On Study MIP-IB12B, laboratory tests to assess hematology parameters (complete blood count), liver function (alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, bilirubin), chemistries (sodium, potassium, chloride, BUN, creatinine, glucose), and minerals (phosphorus, calcium) were measured every week from weeks 2-24, and weekly for 12 weeks following the administration of the second dose. On study MIP-IP12B, patients were excluded if they had AST or ALT ≥2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN, platelets ≤80,000/µL, or absolute neutrophil count ≤1,200/µL. The reviewer analyzed the ADLB.xpt data from the baseline and subsequent measurements. <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 39</ref> summarizes the common laboratory abnormalities for patients in Studies MIP-IB12 and MIP-IB12B. Grade 3 or 4 chemistry abnormalities in more than 2% of patients included elevations in serum glucose, alkaline phosphatase (4.5%), alanine aminotransferase (2.3%), aspartate aminotransferase (2.3%), potassium (4.5%), and bilirubin (3.4%). Changes in hematologic parameters were very common in the study. Grade 3-4 anemia was experienced by 23.9% of patients. Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia was seen in 50% of patients, with Grade 3-4 neutropenia and lymphopenia occurring in 59.1% and 77.3% of patients, respectively. Thirtythree percent of patients demonstrated Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, and Grade 4 neutropenia and anemia were experienced by 16% and 7% of patients, respectively. In Study IB12B following the first therapeutic dose, patients who experienced Grade 4 neutropenia reached neutrophil nadir at a median of 36 days (27 -55 days) and remained at nadir for a median of 12 days <ref type="bibr">(8 -22 days)</ref> until recovery to less than or equal to Grade 3. Following the second dose, patients who experienced Grade 4 neutropenia reached nadir at a median of 43 days (38 -47 days) and remained at nadir for a median of 18.5 days <ref type="bibr">(8 -31 days)</ref> until recovery to less than or equal to Grade 3. Coagulation parameters were not consistently measured across the pooled safety population. The international normalized ratio (INR) was measured only in Study MIP-IB12B (n=68), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was measured only in study MIP-IB12 (n=21). Therefore, these tables are presented separately below. Prothrombin time was measured, but is not graded in CTCAE version 3.  Despite the high incidence of laboratory evidence of coagulopathy, there were no serious bleeding events attributed to treatment with 131 I-MIBG in the pooled safety population. One patient developed a subdural hematoma three years after administration of the second therapeutic dose of 131 I-MIBG in the setting of thrombocytopenia (platelet count 24 x 10 3 /uL) while receiving warfarin. This event was attributed to disease progression.</p><p>Reviewer comment: This reviewer agrees that this event was unlikely to be attributable to 131 I-MIBG. The high incidence of low-grade elevation of clotting parameters may be related to nutritional deficiency of vitamin K in the setting of poor oral intake in patients with nausea and vomiting, and the use of anticoagulation as either prophylaxis or treatment of thromboses.</p><p>Laboratory Evidence of Renal Impairment Thirty-eight percent of patients experienced an increase in creatinine, all of which were Grade 1 or 2. Of these 34 events, all but 7 returned to baseline. Decrease in creatinine clearance (CrCl) or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is not graded in the CTCAE independently of chronic renal failure and thus is not reflected in Error! Reference source not found.. This reviewer performed an analysis of GFR decreases among patients on Study MIP-IB12B, as GFR was not measured on Study MIP-IB12, but was extrapolated from serum creatinine measurements. GFR was measured by 99m Tc diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DPTA) analysis or approximated by 24hour creatinine clearance at 6 months and 12 months on study. This analysis did not include decreases in GFR which remained in the same range of severity, i.e., mild impairment (60 -89 ml/min/1.73m 2 ), moderate impairment (30 -59 ml/min/1.73m 2 ), or severe impairment (15 -NDA/BLA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 209607} {AZEDRA, 131 I-MIBG} 124 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), and excluded decreases of &lt; 10% given the uncertain clinical significance of these small changes. Overall, 16 of 68 patients (24%) demonstrated a significant decrease in GFR which resulted in a shift in range of severity at either the 6-month or 12-month assessment; it should be noted that, due to study discontinuation, not all patients had two GFR measurements or estimates available for comparison. Six patients with normal GFR at baseline had a mildly decreased GFR at 12-month follow-up, and two had a moderate decrease. Seven patients with a mildly decreased GFR had a moderate decrease at 12 months, and one patient with a moderately decreased GFR at baseline had a severely decreased GFR at 12 months. No patients required dialysis or demonstrated a GFR of &lt;15 mL/minute. Only three of the 16 patients identified in this analysis had a reported adverse event of renal failure.</p><p>All patients who demonstrated a decrease in GFR had at least one additional risk factors for renal impairment. Seven of these 16 patients (44%) had a history of type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, including the patient who progressed to a severely decreased CrCl; all had a history of hypertension. As GFR was only collected at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months on Study MIP-IB12B, in many cases it is impossible to determine whether the decrease in renal function was recovered. Seven of 16 patients demonstrated a decreased GFR at 6 months. Of these, 3 did not have subsequent 12 month measurements. The remaining 4 had subsequent measurements; two demonstrated recovery to baseline range of severity, and two demonstrated improvement but incomplete recovery at 12 months. In most (9/16) cases the decrease in GFR or calculated creatinine clearance was identified at the 12-month measurement, and no follow-up measurement was required per protocol.</p><p>A limitation to the analysis of renal failure is the lack of laboratory data beyond 12 months. Neither GFR nor serum creatinine were required to be measured beyond 12 months. Renal failure, renal dysfunction, and elevated creatinine were among AESIs required to be reported during long-term follow-up, but it is possible that renal dysfunction occurring beyond 12 months was unrecognized if no overt clinical signs of renal failure were present and laboratory evaluations were not performed. A universal confounding factor in the assessment of renal dysfunction in this population is the presence of hypertension, often longstanding, which itself may contribute to the observed renal impairment.</p><p>Hepatic Toxicity and Hy's law Two patients experienced laboratory findings consistent with Hy's law restricting to patients with concurrent elevation of AST or ALT ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and bilirubin ≥2 x ULN. A causality analysis was conducted for each of these patients; however, due to other factors, neither clearly fit all criteria for Hy's law. Brief narratives are provided below.</p><p>Patient MIP-IB12B-: A 67-year-old white male with pheochromocytoma metastatic to the liver and bone and baseline liver dysfunction (Grade 1 total bilirubin and Grade 1 AST and ALT elevations) experienced Grade 3 AST and total bilirubin elevation two days following the administration of the first therapeutic dose. The patient experienced Grade 4 dyspnea and right upper quadrant pain, in association with liver enlargement and metastatic pulmonary disease, Reference ID: 4297867 (b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(6)</ref> Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) beginning on the first day following the therapeutic dose. The patient was hospitalized and treated supportively. The laboratory abnormalities started to normalize within one week and did return to baseline (Grade 1). The patient died of progressive disease prior to receipt of a subsequent dose.</p><p>Reviewer comment: This event may represent a case of drug-induced liver injury. The liver injury was reversible, and occurred in the setting of liver metastases.</p><p>Patient MIP-IB12-: A 72-year-old black female with pheochromocytoma experienced Grade 5 hepatic failure attributed by the Applicant to metastatic pheochromocytoma 2.5 months after receipt of the only therapeutic dose. Elevated AST (Grade 1) and alkaline phosphatase (Grade 2) were first documented at baseline. Four weeks after infusion of the patient's only dose of 131 I-MIBG, the patient demonstrated elevated prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR), as well as persistently elevated AST, alkaline phosphatase, and ALT (Grade 1). The patient experienced hypoglycemia and bleeding while taking warfarin for a deep venous thrombosis, and reported a 30-to 45-pound weight loss over the past few months. One month after the initial presentation, she was found unresponsive and admitted with hepatic encephalopathy; during the admission, liver imaging demonstrated multiple hepatic masses with right portal vein reversal of flow. Despite aggressive treatment, the patient continued to decline, with metabolic acidosis, persistent thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. The peak laboratory abnormalities were: alkaline phosphatase Grade 3, AST Grade 2 and total bilirubin Grade 3; it is notable that these values were last reported approximately 6 days prior to the patients' death. The patient died 2.5 months after receipt of the therapeutic dose of 131 I-MIBG after being diagnosed with sepsis due to a urinary tract infection and acute organ failure.</p><p>Reviewer comment: The liver injury in this case is likely multifactorial. The patient appears to have had progressive metastatic disease with liver involvement. Thus, though 131 I-MIBG therapy may have contributed to the liver injury given the timing and a potential mechanism, it is unlikely that 131 I-MIBG is solely responsible for the liver injury. The patient's death appears to be due to sepsis and acute organ failure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vital Signs</head><p>Vital signs were assessed prior to and within 4 hours following each dosimetric and therapeutic 131 I-MIBG infusion. Patients enrolled on Study MIP-IB12B had additional vital sign assessments compared to patients enrolled on Study MIP-IB12, at 24 and 48 hours following each dosimetric dose, and 12 weeks after each therapeutic dose.</p><p>Fever was not common following 131 I-MIBG infusions. One patient had a fever (temperature 38.3 o C, increase of 1.3 o C from baseline) after completion of 131 I-MIBG infusion.</p><p>Heart rate was considered abnormal if it met one of the following criteria: a) &lt;55 beats per minute, b) &gt;110 beats per minute, or c) represented a change of 20 beats per minute from the Reference ID: 4297867 (b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(6)</ref> Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) patient's baseline. Thirteen (13, 14.7%) of 88 patients met one of these criteria at the postinfusion assessment, with 11 of these representing changes in heart rate of 20 beats per minute or more. Only one patient experienced a heart rate of &gt;110 beats per minute.</p><p>The period immediately following 131 I-MIBG infusion was examined for the occurrence of significant increases in blood pressure. Ten patients (11.4%) of the 88 patients experienced an increase in blood pressure immediately following a therapeutic 131 I-MIBG administration, defined as one of the following: 1) a systolic blood pressure of ≥160 mm Hg and an increase of at least 20 mm Hg from pre-treatment baseline or 2) a diastolic blood pressure of ≥100 mm Hg and an increase of at least 10 mm Hg from pre-treatment baseline. No patients experienced systolic blood pressure &gt;200 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than 110 mm Hg following infusion. As noted previously, five patients had a change in antihypertensive medication within 24 -48 hours of the first 131 I-MIBG therapeutic dose administration. All but one had an increase in the dose of an existing antihypertensive medication; one had a single intravenous dose of enalapril.</p><p>Reviewer note: Increases in blood pressure within the first 24 hours following infusion of therapeutic doses of 131 I-MIBG were observed in a small percentage of patients. Given the nearly universal presence of hypertension (controlled or uncontrolled) in this population, close monitoring is warranted to avoid sequelae of severe, uncontrolled hypertension. See Section 13 for labeling recommendations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electrocardiograms (ECGs)</head><p>During Study MIP-IB12B, three 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) were obtained at least 5 minutes apart within 2 hours prior to the dosimetric dose, then at 0-2 minutes, 10 ±2 minutes, 15 ±2 minutes, and 20 ±2 minutes post dosimetric dose. Additional 12-lead ECGs were obtained within 15 minutes prior to the second and third imaging I-131 scans and within 7 days after each therapeutic dose.</p><p>There were three arrhythmias reported as serious adverse events: ventricular tachycardia, tachycardia, and cardio-respiratory arrest (n= 1 each). All were assessed as not related to the study product and were reported as resolved; none of these events occurred in proximity to an infusion of 131 I-MIBG, with times to onset from the most recent therapeutic infusion of 23 -118 days. Seven non-serious events of tachycardia were assessed as possibly or probably related, or related to 131 I-MIBG; these events occurred between 3 -105 days after administration of 131 I-MIBG and were mostly Grade 1 -2 (one Grade 3). Given the pathophysiology of the underlying disease (with catecholamine excess), assessment of the etiology of these events is difficult. Events that occurred in proximity to an infusion are more likely to be related; only one event occurred &lt; 1 week after a therapeutic infusion. In the MIP-IB12/12B safety population, there were no AEs with the preferred term of "ECG QT prolonged" or "Torsades de pointes" reported for the primary safety population. In the exposure-QTc analysis, there was no evident relationship between 131 I-MIBG concentrations and ΔQTc. See the Clinical Pharmacology Review and QT-IRT consult for additional information regarding QT abnormalities and an assessment of the exposure-QTc analysis. A summary copied (with minor edits) from the QT-IRT consult, is included in the following paragraph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>QT</head><p>Study IB12B supports no large mean increases in the ΔQTc interval (i.e., 20 ms) with the proposed therapeutic dosing regimen of 131 I-MIBG, based on central tendency analysis (largest 90% CI upper bound was 14.5 ms at 1 h post-dose after administration of second therapeutic dose). None of the patients had QTcF &gt;500 ms and only one patients had ΔQTcF &gt;60 ms. There was no placebo or positive control in the study. In this open-label, multicenter, single-arm, Phase 2 study, 74 patients received dosimetric doses (3-6 mCi by IV injection) and 68 patients received at least one therapeutic dose of 131 I-MIBG (500 mCi for patients &gt; 62.5 kg and 8 mCi/kg for patients ≤ 62.5 kg; 2 therapeutic doses 3 months apart). Overall summary of findings is presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">Table 42</ref>. The dose used in Study IB12B is the proposed therapeutic dose for the oncology indication and is the MTD. The drug elimination is primarily by the renal route, and renal impairment could likely increase the exposures. 131 I-MIBG is rapidly cleared via the kidney; by 24 and 120 hours post-administration, ~50% and 80% of the injected dose was present in the urine, respectively, as per the proposed label. Thus, no accumulation is anticipated with the second therapeutic dose, as the therapeutic treatment consists of 2 single doses given at least 3 months apart. Because, the Study IB12B did not assess the PK, a concentration-QTc relationship was not evaluated for the product. The therapeutic dose of 131 I-MIBG (500 mCi with μg MIBG) has comparable ( chemical mass dose range of MIBG as the two approved conventional MIBG imaging products, GE AdreView® (Iobenguane I-123 Injection) and Pharmalucence (Iobenguane Sulfate I-131 Injection). The literature data for commercial experience of these products do not suggest a cardiovascular risk.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Renal Failure</head><p>Analysis of adverse event narratives for reported cases of renal failure are discussed in "Significant Adverse Events" in Section 8.2.4, and laboratory evidence of renal impairment is discussed under the sub-heading "Laboratory Analysis." Sixteen patients enrolled on Study MIP-12B demonstrated a significant decrease in creatinine clearance or GFR. Six patients had a reported event of renal failure. Nineteen patients (28%) had either a decrease in GFR, a reported event of renal failure, or both. Of these patients, all had an additional risk factor of hypertension, and 8/19 (42%) had diabetes mellitus. Of the reported adverse events of renal failure or acute kidney injury, most were mild and recovered. Although some cases of decreased GFR in which subsequent measurements were available demonstrated recovery, most cases lacked subsequent measurements and it is unclear whether the decreases in GFR were reversible.</p><p>As previously noted, a limitation to the analysis of renal failure is the lack of laboratory data beyond 12 months. Neither GFR nor serum creatinine were required to be measured beyond 12 months. Renal failure, renal dysfunction, and elevated creatinine were among AESIs required to be reported during long-term follow-up, but it is possible that renal dysfunction occurring beyond 12 months was unrecognized if no overt clinical signs of renal failure were present and laboratory evaluations were not performed. A universal confounding factor in the assessment of renal dysfunction in this population is the presence of hypertension, often severe and longstanding, which itself contributes to renal impairment.</p><p>A determination of the degree of renal impairment attributable to 131 I-MIBG is thus impossible to make.

The NIH Quality of Life and Symptoms Questionnaire includes questions eliciting potentially disease-related symptoms <ref type="bibr">(anxiety, sweating, flushing, palpitations, tremors, etc.)</ref>, as well as patient-reported changes in blood pressure and heart rate. The EORTC QLQ-C30 elicits changes in exercise tolerance or activities of daily living, as well as the patient's overall quality of life.</p><p>Patient-rated overall health and quality-of life was rated from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent) on the EORTC QLQ-C30. An average of these two values for each patient was converted to a percentage in the datasets. Over the course of the study, the value of patient-rated quality of life remained relatively stable. At baseline, the median was 58.3% (range 12.5 -100%); at 12 weeks after therapeutic dose 1, the median was 66.7% (range 16.7 -100%); at 12 months after therapeutic dose 1, the median was 66.7% (range 16.7 -100%). It should be noted that the number of patients for whom data was available was not 100%, and decreased from 57 to 48 over the 12-month period described above. The increase of &lt;10% is unlikely to be clinically meaningful, but may represent stability in overall health and quality of life. KPS during the same time period demonstrated no change in median value (median = 90). Limited conclusions can be drawn from the COA data.

These analyses are all limited by the size of the safety population and relevant subgroups. An analysis of the safety population by age revealed that patients &gt;65 years of age experienced greater percentages of most adverse events. For example, while 64% of patients of all age groups experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) in the gastrointestinal disorders system organ class (SOC), 100% of patients over 65 years of age experienced such a TEAE. There were no significant trends noted in the analysis of TEAEs by race or by gender. The distribution of TEAEs by ethnicity was analyzed, though the analysis was limited by the presence of only one patient in the Hispanic or Latino subgroup.</p><p>Patients who had received 131 I-MIBG therapy prior to study entry experienced somewhat higher incidences of cytopenias when compared with patients who had not received prior 131 I-MIBG therapy. For example, 72% of patients with prior 131 I-MIBG experienced treatment-emergent anemia, compared to 50% of those without prior 131 I-MIBG exposure.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pediatrics and Assessment of Effects on Growth</head><p>131 I-MIBG has not been studied in a dedicated pediatric study in patients with pheochromocytoma. Study MIP-IB12B allowed enrollment of patients aged 12 years and older, and one patient under 18 (age 16 years) was treated on this study. A small dose-finding study of 131 I-MIBG was conducted in 15 patients with neuroblastoma. Given the unmet medical need for adolescents with advanced PPGL, and the treatment of one adolescent on Study MIP-IB12B, the indication was extended to include the treatment of adolescent patients aged 12 years and older. Special consideration regarding radiation exposure in pediatric patients, namely greater absorbed radiation dose and a potential longer life expectancy, was included in the product labeling. 131 I-MIBG was granted orphan designation for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors and is therefore exempt from the Pediatric Research Equities Act (PREA) requirements for this indication.</p></div>

This radiotherapeutic requires special licensing for handling, and will be administered in centers with specialized experience in the administration of radioactive products. Therefore, it is unlikely that drug abuse or any attendant medical issues will occur.</p><p>No clinical data regarding overdose was provided. Overdose is unlikely with proper administration since measurement of radioactivity is required prior to administration as defined in the product labeling. An overdose of the product would likely result in radiation-related toxicities consistent with those described in the product label, of potentially increased severity or duration dependent upon the dose administered. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.10">Safety in the Postmarket Setting</head><p>Safety Concerns Identified Through Postmarket Experience Not applicable. 131 I-MIBG has not been approved for treatment purposes. 131 I-MIBG was previously approved for use as an imaging agent in 1994 with a different formulation and dosage; the product has since been discontinued. Expectations on Safety in the Postmarket Setting Analysis of patients enrolled in studies MIP-IB12B and MIP-IB12 revealed several patients who developed myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukemias. In addition, a small number of patients developed a new primary malignancy after receiving 131 I-MIBG. The majority of cases were highly confounded by prior therapies with known associations with secondary malignancies including leukemia and myelodysplasia. Therefore, the true contribution of 131 I-MIBG in the development of these events, and expected incidence in a less-heavily pretreated population, is unknown. A post-marketing study to evaluate the incidence of secondary malignancies will be conducted by the Applicant; refer to Section 15 Postmarketing Requirements and Commitment, for details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.11">Integrated Assessment of Safety</head><p>The evaluation of the safety of 131 I-MIBG in patients with PPGL was primarily based on Study MIP-IB12B, an open-label, multicenter, single arm trial in 68 patients with PPGL who were not eligible for curative surgery and had either failed a prior therapy or were not eligible for chemotherapy. A pooled population of patients from Study MIP-IB12B and the dose escalation study in PPGL, Study MIP-IB12, was analyzed as the main safety population. The size of the pooled safety database was considered adequate to characterize the safety profile of 131 I-MIBG.</p><p>During Study MIP-IB12B, the most significant safety signal was the development of secondary malignancies including acute leukemias and myelodysplastic syndrome. In the pooled safety population, 7% (n=6) of patients developed acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome. Two patients developed new solid tumors. An association between the development of MDS and acute leukemia and NA-131 I-MIBG has been established in the literature. The confounding factor of exposure to prior therapy with known potential to cause secondary malignancy in all cases of acute leukemia or MDS obscures the magnitude of the risk to patients receiving 131 I-MIBG, but a significant risk exists. Thus, a careful consideration of the potential benefits of treatment with 131 I-MIBG in light of this and other significant risks, is warranted. The risk for development of secondary malignancies will be included in product labeling, and a post-marketing requirement to further assess the risk of secondary malignancy will be performed by the Applicant.</p><p>Myelosuppression was also a prominent, and expected, safety signal in the pooled safety population. Most patients experienced a decrease in one or more cell lines, and severe decreases in platelets and neutrophils were common (50% and 59%, respectively). Myelosuppression was delayed, with blood count nadirs occurring approximately 4 -8 weeks NDA/BLA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 209607} {AZEDRA, 131 I-MIBG} 134 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) after administration of a therapeutic dose, with variable recovery times for neutrophils and platelets of 1 -35 weeks. Ten percent (n=7) of patients on Study MIP-IB12B discontinued the study prior to receipt of the second therapeutic dose due to hematologic adverse events.</p><p>Renal failure was also observed in the study. Initial therapeutic doses of 131 I-MIBG were adjusted based on dosimetry, which accounts for renal clearance; one patient required a dose reduction based on renal injury following administration of the first therapeutic dose. Adverse events of renal failure (6.8%) did not exceed CTCAE Grade 3 in severity and usually occurred in the presence of significant confounding factors (i.e., sepsis, dehydration, etc.). Sixteen patients (24%) demonstrated significant decreases in renal function as measured by GFR or creatinine clearance during the study; the contribution of 131 I-MIBG as compared to hypertension (100% of patients) or diabetes (44% of patients) is unclear. No patients required dialysis.</p><p>Finally, one patient in the expanded access program for study MIP-IB12B developed fatal pneumonitis 9 weeks after treatment with a single dose of 131 I-MIBG. The patient did not have pulmonary metastases, which would be expected to increase the risk of radiation toxicity to the lungs. Limited information regarding the expected incidence of or risk factors for radiation pneumonitis can be extrapolated from this single case. Severe pulmonary sequelae, such as ARDS and BOOP, have been reported using non-Azedra formulations of 131 I-MIBG.</p><p>Other known radiation-related toxicities were not prominent signals in the safety database, but warrant consideration in the overall benefit-risk assessment of 131 I-MIBG given the mechanism of action. Hypothyroidism occurred in 2% (n=2) of patients; there were no reports of thyroid neoplasia, though this has been reported in the literature. Hypothyroidism is managed with appropriate monitoring and thyroid hormone replacement. Severe liver sequelae, such as venoocclusive disease, has also been reported with NA-131 I-MIBG preparations. Clinical or laboratory events suggestive of liver disease or injury in the 131 I-MIBG development program were confounded by metastatic disease.</p><p>Overall, the safety review of the 131 I-MIBG database did not reveal new safety concerns, but confirmed expected safety signals based on published reports of NA-131 I-MIBG, adverse events reported to the IND, and based on the mechanism of action. The safety data from Study MIP-IB12B and MIP-IB12 do not change with favorable benefit-risk assessment for 131 I-MIBG for the treatment of patients with iobenguane scan positive, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic PPGL who require systemic anticancer therapy.</p><p>NDA/BLA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 209607} {AZEDRA, 131 I-MIBG} 135 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) 10 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.1">Statistical Issues</head><p>There is no major statistical issue that impacts the overall conclusions of Study MIP-IB12B. However, the limitation of single arm design prevents the study from providing adequate interpretation of the results of a time to event endpoint such as OS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.2">Conclusions and Recommendations</head><p>Patients with iobenguane scan positive, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic PPGL who require systemic anticancer therapy represent a population with a serious and life-threatening rare disease for which there is no FDA-approved therapy and no known curative therapy. Although some patients demonstrate responses to off-label use of cytotoxic chemotherapy, complete responses are rare. Off-label use of NA-131 I-MIBG is a standard therapy for PPGL which cannot be cured by surgical resection alone.</p><p>The clinical benefit of 131 I-MIBG for patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic PPGL who require systemic anticancer therapy is based on the results of Study MIP-IB12B. The primary endpoint, a 50% reduction (including discontinuation) of antihypertensive medications for at least 6 months, was a novel endpoint in the PPGL population. Given the morbidity associated with hypertension in this population, and the direct contribution of the tumor to hypertension through secretion of catecholamines, this endpoint was designed as a measure of direct clinical benefit. The study was conducted under an SPA, and the endpoint and design of the study were agreed to by FDA. The primary endpoint was achieved by 25% of patients (95% CI: 16.2% -36.5%). The antitumor activity of 131 I-MIBG was confirmed by traditional tumor response criteria, RECIST v. 1.0; 22.1% of the evaluable population demonstrated a confirmed, centrally reviewed response of PR (95% CI: 13.6%, 32.7%).</p><p>Combined, durable response in hypertension as measured by the primary endpoint and confirmed objective response are measures of direct clinical benefit in this population.</p><p>The primary safety risks of 131 I-MIBG are related to the radiation exposure of the product. Myelosuppression and gastrointestinal adverse reactions were the most common adverse effects by system organ class. The risk of myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia was less common, occurring in 7% of the pooled safety population. Although these events were largely confounded by prior, potentially leukemogenic therapy, this remains a significant and serious risk of 131 I-MIBG and requires further study. The serious nature of these risks supports the use of 131 I-MIBG only in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic PPGL who require systemic anticancer therapy disease and who have no other known curative options. Based on the rarity of this disease, demonstrated clinical benefit, and lack of approved therapeutic options, the reviewers recommend regular approval of the product. The clinical and statistical reviewers do not recommend a REMS be implemented for 131 I-MIBG given widespread experience with NA-131 I-MIBG and the necessity of delivering this product in centers certified to deliver radioactive therapies. However, a PMR will be completed to fully characterize the risk of developing secondary malignancies in patients treated with 131 I-MIBG. Risk management will also include product labeling and routine pharmacovigilance to ensure the safe and effective use of 131 I-MIBG. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="19">Division Director (Clinical)</head><p>I agree with the review teams regarding the approval of this application. Nevertheless, I will summarize my thoughts regarding certain pertinent aspects of the application.</p><p>Orphan Indication: Malignant pheochromocytoma (and paraganglioma) is an ultrarare disease that can result in morbidity or mortality either due to the underlying tumor burden or due to excess catecholamine hormone production. The specific incidence of malignant PPGL is hard to quantify. The applicant estimated (approximately) 60 to 120 cases per year in the US. The upper estimate of the reported incidence of pheochromocytoma (0.8 per 100,000 person-years) was described in a paper from the Mayo clinic from 1983 (with data from 1950 to 1979). In the report <ref type="bibr">(Beard et al., Mayo Clin Proc, 1983)</ref>, five of the eleven cases were initially diagnosed at autopsy. A more modern analysis (data from 2007 to 2015 and published in abstract form) based on a Danish registry provided for an estimate of 4.65 cases per million person years. The report (Ebbehoj et al., Endocrine Abstracts, 2017) stated that the incidence is increasing; however, nearly 60% of cases from 2007 to 2015 were incidentally discovered while the patients were undergoing imaging.</p><p>The Danish paper did not describe the percentage of cases of PPGL determined to be malignant. The applicant provided for an estimate of 10 to 20%; however, the literature report provided by the applicant listed this estimate in the background of the report (and I could not determine how these data were obtained). A retrospective record review of 152 patients from Korea found 11% of patients to have metastatic disease with a mean follow-up of 41.5 months.</p><p>Clearly, there are limitations to the data providing for estimates of malignant PPGL. If the applicant's estimate is approximate to the true incidence, it shows the rarity of the disease, and the difficulty in conducting studies in this disease. For example, logistically, to enroll a patient into a trial, a patient would have to live in proximity to a study site (or have the resources to travel multiple times to the site) and would have to meet eligibility criteria for entry into the trial. For the pivotal trial conducted by the applicant, ten centers in the US enrolled patients (generally in major academic centers in large cities). It took from June 2009 to January 2016 to enroll 68 patients who received at least one dose of I-131 MIBG.</p><p>Furthermore, due to compounding or expanded access, patients have received I-131 MIBG in the US outside of the Progenics protocol. For example, the 2013 Consensus Guidelines for Neuroendocrine Tumors <ref type="bibr">(Kunz et al., Pancreas, 2013)</ref> list I-131 MIBG as an option to consider in patients who need systemic treatment. In Europe, I-131 MIBG is authorized for diagnostic or therapeutic uses, depending on the country (http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en GB/document). Ultimately, these factors underscore the Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) pressure can be affected by changes in anti-hypertensive medications (i.e., in addition to I-131 MIBG). Nevertheless, a total of 20-25% of patients had reductions in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg (described in clinical review above). This is like the proportion of patients who met the primary endpoint and the proportion of patient who had a tumor response per RECIST.</p><p>Overall 22% of patients experienced a response per RECIST criteria (per FDA's analysis). This shows anti-tumor effects of I-131 MIGB; however, I acknowledge that this is a modest effect. A similar modest effect on response rate was observed in a different neuroendocrine tumor population (midgut neuroendocrine tumors) with a different radiotherapeutic (Lutathera) and this translated into a large effect on PFS. Nevertheless, I cannot determine based on the data in this application whether the effects of the two drugs are analogous.</p><p>Other clinical effects, indicative of anti-tumor activity (but not necessarily clinical benefit) were also observed during treatment with I-131 MIBG. These included reductions in urine and blood norepinephrine levels. Also, in exploratory PRO analyses, global health status appeared to increase in patients treated with I-131 MIBG; however, these data are difficult to interpret in single arm trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risk-Benefit</head><p>Overall, I agree with the clinical team regarding the risk-benefit determination. The most important safety risks of I-131 MIBG are related to radiation exposure with myelosuppression and gastrointestinal adverse reactions being the most common toxicities. Myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia are important risks with 131 I-MIBG. It was difficult to isolate the effect of a single course of I-131 MIBG on MDS/leukemia risk as patients who developed MDS or leukemia had been exposed to other therapies that increase the risk of MDS/leukemia (including prior I-131 MIBG). Nevertheless, I believe that I-131 MIBG will cause MDS and leukemia in some patients. The most important factor regarding the maximization of risk and benefit in PPGL will be patient selection. In labeling, I agree with the recommendation to highlight that the indication for I-131 MIBG will be limited to those patients where systemic therapy is needed. Patients amenable to local therapies or a watch and wait approach would generally be less appropriate for I-131 MIBG given that these patients may have a long-life expectancy where MDS/leukemia (or other delayed radiation effects) may cause significant morbidity or mortality. Importantly, given the complexity of patient management in PPGL, multidisciplinary teams are common which should optimize treatment selection and informed consent for most patients.</p><p>Although modest, I-131 MIBG demonstrated anti-tumor effects which may provide benefit for the properly selected patient. Patients with PPGL have other tumor-related symptoms due to catecholamine excess which plausibly might be effected by I-131 MIBG (given reductions on catecholamine levels, blood pressure, and tumor size). This assessment is also made in the specific context of a disease setting where there are no effective systemic treatments and in an ultrarare disease.</p><p>NDA/BLA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 209607} {AZEDRA, 131 I-MIBG} 148 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) My approval recommendation of this application is context-specific, considering the rare disease, specific challenges in developing an I-131 MIBG therapy in this disease, the prior SPA agreement, and the lack of available systemic therapies for patients with PPGL (unmet need).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unmet Need</head><p>Although some patients with malignant pheochromocytoma can have long survival, the majority who cannot be successfully treated with locoregional therapies and who require systemic therapy will ultimately die from their disease. In the IB12B trial conducted by Progenics, median survival of all patients who received at least 1 dose was approximately three years (note this was time from treatment, not time from diagnosis). Cytoreductive surgery or local therapies are standard treatment options in patients with malignant PPGL. Most patients in Study IB12B underwent prior adrenalectomy, tumor excision, mass excision, or lymphadenectomy. About half of patients received prior radiation and about half received prior drug or biologic therapy. Clearly, there is a patient population who could potentially benefit from effective systemic therapy. To date, there are limited options for such patients (e.g., either compounded I-131 MIBG or off-label cytotoxic chemotherapy). Some of the patients in the IB12B trial had received prior I-131 MIBG. Importantly, the patient population appropriate for systemic therapy differs from the population described in the DMIP consult (the consult cited a report with data limited to a subset of patients with PPGL who had germline mutations in SDHB [these patients are generally younger] and the report did not describe the extent of metastatic disease or whether patients underwent successful metastatectomy).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Endpoints and Clinical Effects</head><p>FDA previously agreed to the primary endpoint in reduction in anti-hypertensive medication use (for at least six months) under a Special Protocol Assessment (in 2009). At the time, this endpoint was considered by FDA to provide a benchmark to assess clinical benefit in the proposed single arm trial while also assessing for an effect on tumor size. I believe as a single endpoint, the reduction in blood pressure medication use (for at least six months) in an unblinded single arm trial could be problematic. First, it represents a surrogate for blood pressure reduction (with elevations in blood pressure one of the causes of morbidity in PPGL); second, the decision to adjust blood pressure medication (increase or decrease) may be influenced by patient-or physician-factors; and third, the perceived clinical benefit of blood pressure reduction may be highly dependent upon the regimen the patient is receiving. To highlight the later example, a patient on a single daily dose of medication who decreases the dose by half would be perceived to have less benefit than a patient on four drugs who can discontinue three or four of them. In Study IB12B, 25% of the patients met the pre-defined endpoint. The point estimate for the response rate was higher (32%) among the 50 patients who could receive two doses. Additional patients also had reductions in blood pressure medications but not for the required six-month duration. As such, the milestone (six month) analysis provided an arbitrary cut-point and probably was less informative than a traditional KM analysis (that shows durability of treatment effect in all responders).</p><p>Assessments of the effects of an anti-cancer drug on blood pressure in an oncology trial are difficult based on the methods or frequency of blood pressure monitoring and because blood This is a representation of an electronic record that was signed electronically.
