Symptoms of menopause, such as vasomotor symptoms (VMS; hot flashes/hot flushes) and vulvar and vaginal atrophy symptoms [VVA; vaginal dryness, vaginal irritation/itching, and pain with sexual activity (dyspareunia)] can be debilitating with respect to a woman's ability to accomplish her normal activities including sleep. However, menopause is not a life-threatening condition. In 2000, there were an estimated 45.6 million postmenopausal women in the United States. About 40 million of them were older than age 51, the average age of natural menopause in the Western world. By the year 2020, the number of US women older than age 51 is expected to be more than 50 million. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">1</ref> Current treatment options for the general indication for the treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of VVA, involve multiple estrogen products, used alone in a woman without a uterus, or in combination with a progestogen in a woman with a uterus. Most of these products were approved under estrogen class labeling, and were not supported by clinical trial data demonstrating relief of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy. Current treatment options for an indication for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia (self-identified as most bothersome by the woman) include one intravaginally applied estrogen cream, one oral estrogen tablet, and one oral estrogen agonist/antagonist tablet.</p><p>Prasterone is a steroid vaginal insert. Prasterone is a synthetic version of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). DHEA is an endogenous hormone produced by the human body. DHEA is an inactive precursor hormone but can be converted to active forms such as androgens and estrogens. No structurally similar steroid hormone is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, due to menopause. Prasterone 6.5 mg vaginal insert, administered intravaginally once daily at bedtime, demonstrated statistically significant improvement over placebo, in the relief of selfidentified moderate to severe dyspareunia, in two confirmatory 12-week clinical trials. No major safety issues, related specifically to the 6.5 mg prasterone vaginal insert, were identified in this review in four 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical trials and one 12month open-label clinical trial. Application site discharge was the most common adverse reaction identified with the use of the 6.5 mg prasterone vaginal insert. This specific adverse reaction resolved over a 12-month period in the long-term clinical trial.</p><p>With the approval of 6.5 mg INTRAROSA™ (prasterone) vaginal insert, symptomatic postmenopausal women, with moderate to severe dyspareunia, will have access to an Clinical Review Theresa H. van der Vlugt, M.D., M.P.H. NDA 208470 INTRAROSA (prasterone) vaginal insert additional vaginally administered product for this indication. Vaginally administered products for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, due to menopause, are recommended for this indication.</p><p>Approval of prasterone for use in the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia in postmenopausal women is fully supported by the available evidence of efficacy and safety.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.2</head><p>Tables of Currently Available Treatments for Proposed Indications <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> shows the number of drug products approved for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia (or pain with sexual activity), due to menopause. Several estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin products are approved with a general indication for the treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) due to menopause. See the " Treatments for a Non-Specific VVA Symptom Indication", in Subsection 9.4 of this review, for information on currently approved estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin products with a general indication for the treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, due to menopause. Most of these products approved for a general indication for the treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of VVA, were approved under estrogen class labeling, and were not supported by clinical trial data demonstrating relief of individual moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy. Subsequent to the approval under class labeling of products for the general indication of treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause, the Division of Reproductive and Urologic Drug Products [(DRUDP), now known as the Division of Bone, Reproductive, and Urologic Products (DBRUP)] discussed the approach of approval under class labeling with its Fertility &amp; Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee (AC). Taking the advice of the AC into consideration, we determined that sponsors seeking an indication for any symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy should conduct clinical trials in support of the indication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Availability of Proposed Active Ingredient in the United States</head><p>DHEA is available in the U.S. without a prescription; 10 mg to 100 mg capsules and/or tablets and a 1% cream can be obtained over-the-counter or the internet. A prescription for DHEA is needed in Canada where DHEA is considered an anabolic steroid.</p><p>At the time of this review, no structurally similar product is approved for the proposed indication.</p><p>On December 21, 2105, Norman R. Schmuff, Ph.D., Associate Director for Science, Office of Process and Facilities (OPF) at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) states:</p><p>"Prasterone is an endogenous steroid hormone. Prasterone is the United States Adopted Name (USAN) and the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) for dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) which is the both the active moiety and the active ingredient in INTRAROSA. It is marketed as a dietary supplement where it is generally known as DHEA." "However, it has also been marketed as a drug under the name DHEA, prompting the issuance of a number of FDA Warning Letters." One example follows:</p><p>"June 10, 2015 Warning Letter to Daniel V. Young: Based on our review of your products' labels and your websites, countrydoctorherbal.us and countrydoctornutritionalcenter.us, in March 2015, we have determined that the claims on your labels and websites establish that several of your firm's products are drugs within the meaning of section 201(g)(1)(B) and/or (g)(1)(C) of the Act [21 USC § 321(g)(1)(B) and/or (g)(1)(C)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or are articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body…. COUNTRY DOCTOR DHEA (CAPSULE ONLY)  "[M]ay help….treat osteoporosis"</p><p>The November 4, 2015 Manual of Policies and Procedures (MaPP) entitled, "NDA Classification Codes" contains the following definition for New Molecular Entity (NME):</p><p>"An NME is an active ingredient that contains no active moiety that has been previously approved by the Agency in an application submitted under section 505 of the Act or has been previously marketed as a drug in the United States."</p><p>OPF concludes:</p><p>"As evidenced by the FDA Warning Letters cited above, prasterone (aka DHEA) is an active ingredient containing an active moiety that has been previously marketed as a drug in the United States. Consequently, the prasterone active ingredient in the INTRAROSA (prasterone insert) NDA is not an NME."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Reviewer's Comments:</head><p>Although DHEA is not considered a NME by the Agency, it is a new chemical entity (NCE) proposed for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia due to menopause. As an NCE for this indication, the Agency recommended that EndoCeutics adhere to the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E1 Guidelines for premarket patient exposure for a drug product intended for chronic use. These guidelines recommend exposure in 1500 patients overall, 300-600 patients for 6 months, and 100 patients for one year. Patient exposure must occur at the dose or dose range expected to be efficacious.</p><p>EndoCeutics complied with the ICH E1 guideline recommendations in the DHEA development program.</p></div>

In the U.S., anabolic steroids are Schedule III substances under the Controlled Substances Act. "A wide range of adverse effects is associated with the use or abuse of anabolic steroids. These effects depend on several factors including: age, sex, the anabolic steroid used, amount used, and duration of use. In adolescents, anabolic steroid use can stunt the Clinical Review Theresa H. van der Vlugt, M.D., M.P.H. NDA 208470 INTRAROSA (prasterone) vaginal insert ultimate height than an individual achieves. In boys, steroid use can cause early sexual development, acne, and stunted growth. In adolescent girls and women, anabolic steroid use can induce permanent physical changes, such as deepening of the voice, increased facial and body hair growth, menstrual irregularities, male pattern baldness, and lengthening of the clitoris. In men, anabolic steroid use can cause shrinkage of the testicles, reduced sperm count, enlargement of male breast tissue, sterility, and an increased risk of prostate cancer. In both men and women, anabolic steroid use can cause high cholesterol levels, which may increase the risk of coronary artery disease, strokes, and heart attacks. Anabolic steroid use can also cause acne and fluid retention. Oral preparations of anabolic steroids, in particular, can damage the liver." <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">2</ref> "Case studies and scientific research indicate that high doses of anabolic steroids may cause mood and behavioral effects. In some individuals, steroid use can cause dramatic mood swings, increased feelings of hostility, impaired judgment, and increased levels of aggression (often referred to as "roid rage"). When users stop taking steroids, they may experience depression that may be severe enough to lead one to commit suicide. Anabolic steroid use may also cause psychological dependence and addition." <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">2</ref> In Canada, DHEA is a controlled drug listed under Section 23 Schedule IV of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and as such is available by prescription only. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">3</ref> In the human body, large amounts of the inactive precursor steroids DHEA and DHEAsulfate (DHEA-S) are converted into bioactive steroid hormones such as potent androgens [testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT))] and/or estrogens in peripheral tissues. Per the applicant, following their formation and availability for local intracellular action, testosterone and DHT are inactivated and transformed in the same cells into water soluble glucuronide derivatives eliminated by the kidneys.</p><p>DHEA functions predominantly as a metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of androgen and estrogen sex steroids. As such, DHEA could be considered a relatively weak anabolic steroid. Overall, the long-term effects of exogenous DHEA use are largely unknown as DHEA use has not been studied in long-term, randomized clinical trials of sufficient size. On March 31, 2009, DBRUP met with EndoCeutics (Type C Guidance Meeting). Selected EndoCeutics preclinical and clinical questions, and DBRUP responses, are presented below:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Summary of Presubmission Regulatory Activity Related to Submission</head><p>Preclinical: Question Number 1: "Based upon the absence of significant findings in the repeateddose one-year oral toxicity study with DHEA in monkeys (2 and 10 mg/kg/day) and in the 26-week oral toxicity study in rats (10 and 100 mg/kg/day) as well as the absence of effect of DHEA in the three standard genotoxicity assays and the fact that is used exclusively in postmenopausal women and the absence of significant change in serum estrogen and androgen levels, EndoCeutics believes that the current preclinical toxicology package should be acceptable for approval of (0.5% DHEA, 6.5 mg DHEA) for the vaginal atrophy indication. Does the FDA agree?"</p></div>

Based on the above-described reasons, we believe that partner exposure does not require further evaluation. Does the Agency agree?" DBRUP Response: "We cannot agree at this time that you have sufficient information to support the safety of the exposed partner. This will be a review issue. At the time of the NDA submission, you should provide a thorough justification that the safety of the exposed partner has been adequately evaluated. This justification should include but is not limited to: 1) the expected drug concentration in the male partner given the daily administration of 0.50% prasterone in the female partner, 2) potential safety concerns in males that could be related to the drug exposure, and 3) actual adverse events observed in exposed male partners." On September 5, 2013, EndoCeutics submits the following clarification questions: Question Number 1: "Does the Agency agree that as per the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines, women in clinical trials who receive daily treatment with 0.25% prasterone can be considered to be within an established dose range of efficacy and therefore, can be included in the total number of 1500 subjects exposed to the investigational drug? It is our understanding that we have already obtained adequate/required prasterone exposure in 1178 patients and that we only need to generate exposure date in another 322 patients to fulfill the guideline."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DBRUP Response:</head><p>"We accept the subjects exposed to prasterone (DHEA) 3.25 mg (0.25%) would have been considered as within the anticipated dose range of efficacy and can be included in the total number of exposed subjects.

Selected questions and DBRUP responses are reviewed below:</p><p>Clinical Review Theresa H. van der Vlugt, M.D., M.P.H. NDA 208470 INTRAROSA (prasterone) vaginal insert 21 Nonclinical: Question Number 1: "For the Module 4 of the NDA, is it acceptable for the Agency that we include in the NDA the new study report on CYP inhibition but that crossreference be made to the previously submitted and unchanged non-clinical study reports (Module 4.2.2.6), or if all nonclinical reports (toxicity and analytical reports) should be re-submitted in the NDA. The schematic presentation of the drug metabolism pathway will be included in the summary of clinical pharmacology (Module 2.7.2). Does the Agency agree that with the additional CYP study performed all preclinical requirements are met to support the NDA?" DBRUP Response: "Yes, you have met all nonclinical requirements to support the NDA. For ease of review, we ask that all nonclinical study reports that will be used to support the nonclinical portion of your current NDA submission be resubmitted in Module 4 of the NDA. We also ask that you provide a tabular listing of titles of studies from all INDs or NDAs that you intend to use to support the nonclinical portion of your current NDA submission. This can be included in Module 2 under Nonclinical Overview." Clinical: Question Number 3: "Does the Agency agree with the proposed data and population to be used for the integrated efficacy analysis?" DBRUP Response: "No, we do not agree with your proposal to integrate efficacy data from 12-week Trial ERC-231 and 12-week Trial ERC-238 with your post-hoc analysis of Trial ERC-210 to support the indication of treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, due to menopause.</p><p>We consider DHEA to be a new molecular entity (NME). This NME should be supported by two confirmatory adequate and well-controlled 12-week, phase 3 clinical trials for safety and efficacy. As previously conveyed to you, we do not agree that Trial ERC-210 can be considered as one of the confirmatory 12-week clinical trials to support the effectiveness of 0.50% prasterone (DHEA) for the indication as noted above. Our consideration of the efficacy of your product will be based on the results of Trial ERC-231 and Trial ERC-238, analyzed separately. Your proposed post-hoc analysis of Trial ERC-210 could be submitted as supportive of your two confirmatory clinical trials.</p><p>The primary efficacy analyses in Trial ERC-231 and Trial ERC-238 should be based on women who meet all three of the baseline inclusion criteria: 1) less than 5% superficial cells on a lateral-wall vaginal smear, and 2) a vaginal pH greater than 5, and 3) a most bothersome moderate to severe symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (defined as dyspareunia in Trials ERC-231 and ERC-238).</p><p>Clinical Review Theresa H. van der Vlugt, M.D., M.P.H.

An orphan designation is not a marketing authorization.</p><p>On March 18, 2015, EndoCeutics received an Advice iPSP letter stating: "We also refer to your Initial Pediatric Study Plan (iPSP) submission dated December 13, 2013. We agree with your plan to waive studies in pediatric subjects and that you will submit a request for waiver from all requirements from Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) in a marketing application for EM-760 (prasterone, DHEA) intended for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of vulvovaginal atrophy, due to menopause.

We have completed our review of the submission, and we confirm our agreement to your Agreed iPSP."</p><p>In this NDA application, EndoCeutics provides information supporting their request for Priority Review Designation. DBRUP recommends that DHEA not be granted a Priority Review Designation for the following reasons: The Debarment Certification, dated September 18, 2015, available in the application states: "EndoCeutics hereby certifies that it did not and will not use in any capacity the services of any person debarred under section 306 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in connection with this application."</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Preclinical Pharmacology/Toxicology</head><p>The applicant performed a series of nonclinical studies in rodents to study the pharmacologic effects of DHEA in the vagina. Per the applicant, rat or mouse adrenals do not secrete DHEA or DHEA-sulfate (DHEA-S); therefore, exogenous administration of DHEA to rodents represents the only source of this steroid.</p><p>The most pertinent nonclinical study was performed in ovariectomized (OVX) female rats administered intravaginal DHEA at daily doses of 0.33 mg, 0.66 mg or 1 mg for two weeks. The objective was to induce local vaginal effects without systemic action. The applicant states, "Since DHEA has no intrinsic androgenic or estrogenic activity, the effects observed after DHEA treatment reflect its intracrine conversion by the steroidogenic enzymes into active sex steroids having estrogenic and/or androgenic action."</p><p>Per the application, this preclinical study showed that the morphological effects of DHEA on the vaginal mucosa were "observed at the lowest dose used (0.33 mg DHEA insert) and consisted mainly of a typical androgenic effect of epithelial mucification, high compactness of delicate, finely woven lamina propria collagen fibers and moderate increase in muscularis thickness." "No change in morphological features related to cell proliferation was observed at any DHEA dose used (up to 1 mg DHEA/suppository) on the uterus, mammary gland and skin. Immunohistochemistry for androgen, estrogen alpha and progesterone receptors did not reveal any significant systemic effects in the uterus, mammary gland and skin except some suggestion of increased androgen receptor labeling in mammary gland and skin at the highest DHEA dose."</p><p>Other short-and long-term nonclinical studies in rodents were performed with DHEA administered orally, subcutaneously, intravenously (IV), by local application on the vaginal mucosa or by percutaneous administration on the dorsal skin in order to avoid In these pharmacokinetic studies, serum levels of DHEA and of its most important metabolites were measured using validated GC-MS and LC-MS/MS methods, per the application.</p><p>In addition to the pharmacologic studies, two repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed in rats and monkeys. The objective of the first toxicity study (LREM-1375) was to assess the toxicity of DHEA, administered orally by gavage to monkeys for 52 weeks. Male and female cynomolgus monkeys received vehicle or 2 or 10 mg DHEA/kg of body weight/day (mg/kg/day). Monkey adrenal glands secrete DHEA and DHEA-S. In control female monkeys, exposure to DHEA ranged from 143 to 171 ng.hr/ml and exposure to DHEA-S ranged from 1.48 to 2.19 μg.hr/ml (based on serum concentrations at Days 1, 184 and 359). Per the application, these exposure results are "approximately 3-7 times that achieved with a 0.50% DHEA vaginal suppository in women (Study report: ERC-213)." Similar concentrations of DHEA and DHEA-S were detected in control male monkeys.</p><p>Groups of male and female monkeys also received 10 mg DHEA/kg/day in combination with estradiol or 10 mg DHEA/kg/day in combination with estradiol and the estrogen agonist/antagonist acolbifene in Study LREM-1375. Per the application, DHEA alone and in combination with estradiol and/or acolbifene was well tolerated in monkeys of both sexes. "There were no toxicologically significant changes in clinical, hematological or biochemical parameters and no unexpected macroscopic or histological changes (Study report: LREM-SN-1375)."</p><p>The objective of the second study (LREM-1376) was to assess the toxicity of DHEA administered orally by gavage to rats for 26 weeks. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats received vehicle or 10 or 100 mg DHEA/kg of body weight/day (mg/kg/day). Groups of male and female rats also received 100 mg DHEA/kg/day in combination with estradiol or 100 mg DHEA/kg/day in combination with estradiol and the estrogen agonist/antagonist acolbifene in this study. Per the application, "the rat adrenal glands do not secrete large amounts of DHEA or DHEA-sulfate (DHEA-S) and these steroids were generally not quantifiable in the serum of control rats." Exposure to DHEA and DHEA-S in rats dosed with 10 or 100 mg DHEA/kg/day was dose-related in both sexes and at least 5 times higher in female rats compared to male rats. "DHEA was well tolerated in male and female rats. Lower serum bilirubin concentrations and higher serum alkaline phosphatase values were noted in both male and female rats dosed with 100 mg DHEA/kg/day. These were attributed to DHEA effects on liver and bone, respectively. Increased urine production, attributed to the high serum concentrations of DHEA-S, was observed in female rats dosed with 10 or 100 mg DHEA/kg/day." Per the application, "the exposure to DHEA and DHEA-S achieved in rats dosed with 100 mg The genotoxicity of DHEA was evaluated in three different assays:  a bacterial mutagenicity assay (Study 7220-105),  a human blood lymphocyte assay (Study 7220-106), and  in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay (Study 7220-107).</p><p>Results obtained from these three genotoxicity assays with DHEA are summarized in the corresponding study reports in the application. Per the applicant, "DHEA was considered negative in the three genotoxicity assays."</p><p>No carcinogenicity study was performed with DHEA. A waiver of carcinogenicity studies was granted in IND , Advice/Information Request letter, dated January 24, 2014:</p><p>"We have reviewed your submissions, and agree that no carcinogenicity studies are needed for DHEA. In vivo carcinogenicity studies can be waived for DHEA vaginal suppository provided you agree to add wording regarding the carcinogenicity of estrogens and androgens in the product labeling. This wording would be similar to product labeling for Premarin vaginal cream and topical androgens such as Androgel and Fortesta."</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.1">Mechanism of Action</head><p>Per the applicant, "Sex steroids in the human are from two sources, namely of gonadal and adrenal origins. In fact, humans, along with other primates, are unique among animal species in having adrenals that secrete large amounts of the inactive precursor steroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) which is converted into not only estrogens but also into potent androgens in peripheral target tissues. The local synthesis and action of sex steroids in peripheral target tissues has been called intracrinology. DHEA (prasterone) is a natural (endogenous) compound inactive by itself with no estrogenic, androgenic or other hormonal activity." "Since DHEA has no intrinsic androgenic or estrogenic activity, the histological changes observed after DHEA treatment reflect its intracrine conversion into active sex steroids having estrogenic and/or androgenic action. The tissue-specific conversion of DHEA in individual cells and tissues permits adjustments according to local anatomical and functional requirements, thus illustrating the new sector of endocrinology called intracrinology."</p><p>Per the applicant, "The local biosynthesis of active sex steroids in most peripheral tissues is supported by the local presence of enzymes required for the conversion of the inactive adrenal precursor dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) into estradiol (E2) and androgens which exert their activity locally by means of the estrogen receptors (ERs) present in estrogen-sensitive cells or androgen receptors expressed in androgensensitive cells (see Labrie and Labrie 2013 in the application)." "The enzymes </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Reviewer's Comments:</head><p>This application contains numerous preclinical studies conducted in support of the formation of androgen and estrogen sex steroids peripherally in target tissue. Per the applicant, "We have shown in preclinical studies in rats that DHEA administration causes a complete reversal of the vaginal atrophy observed after oophorectomy. The morphological changes observed in the rat vagina after DHEA treatment reflects its local conversion into active sex steroids having androgenic and estrogenic action through intracrine mechanisms. In addition, in the rat study performed with vaginal DHEA suppositories, we have shown that DHEA exerts beneficial effects limited to the vagina."</p><p>This reviewer has not found published literature that refutes this observation by the applicant in preclinical studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.2">Pharmacodynamics</head><p>In nonclinical studies, the applicant studied the vaginal effects of intravaginal administration of DHEA at daily doses of 0.33 mg to 1 mg in ovariectomized female rats for two weeks, showing that serum DHEA, DHEA-sulfate (DHEA-S), and androst-5-ene-3β-diol (5-DIOL) were increased over a 4 hour time period, but serum testosterone, estradiol, estrone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) remained below detectable levels. Per the application, after 2 weeks of daily treatment, the placebo insert produced minimal epithelial thickening limited to the vaginal distal half. Per the trial report, the The applicant also studied the possible time-dependent differential effects of 1, 3, and 6 months of percutaneous (30 mg applied twice daily to the dorsal skin area) and intravaginal DHEA treatment of ovariectomized rats on vaginal and uterine histopathology. Per the trial report available in the application, stratification as well as keratinization and mucification of the vaginal epithelium was observed. The trial population consisted of 40 postmenopausal women with self-assessed vaginal atrophy and vaginal dryness. The primary objective of Trial ERC-213 was to evaluate serum levels of DHEA and its metabolites after intravaginal administration of the trial medication. Bioavailability parameters, as well as safety and tolerance parameters, were evaluated at Day 1 and Day 7. Vaginal maturation index and value and vaginal pH were also evaluated at Day 1 and Day 7 to obtain an indication of the local effect of DHEA. The inserts were vaginally applied daily in the evening, between 22:00 and 23:00, for 1 week.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated on Day 1 and Day 7, including AUC 0-24 and C max , and summarized using means, standard of error mean (SEM), median, minimum and maximum values, and coefficients of variation. Confidence intervals (95% two-tailed) were calculated for AUC 0-24 , basal and average serum steroid levels, C max , vaginal maturation value and vaginal pH. Differences between Day 1 and Day 7 were summarized in the same manner. Statistical analysis of the Day 7 minus Day 1 differences was performed using paired t-tests within each treatment group without adjustment for multiple comparisons.</p><p>In ERC-213, serum estradiol and testosterone, as well as DHEA and nine of its other metabolites, were assayed at ten time intervals over 24 h following the 1 st and 7 th (SD) serum estradiol concentration of 4.17 ± 3.29 pg/mL (median of 3.44 pg/mL) measured by mass spectrometry-based assay. The 5 th -95 th centiles range reported for estradiol was 1.0-9.27. The baseline (untreated) testosterone mean ± SD in postmenopausal women was reported, in this same trial, as 0.14 ± 0.07 ng/mL (median of 0.13 ng/mL) with a 5 th -95 th centile range reported as 0.06-0.26. Testosterone was also measured by mass spectrometry assay. Other published literatures cite these reported findings.</p><p>Per the applicant, in order to avoid the risks of systemic exposure, serum estradiol and testosterone concentrations (both measured by mass spectrometrybased assays) should remain below the 95 th centiles measured at 9.3 pg/ml and 0.26 ng/ml for estradiol and testosterone in normal postmenopausal women. In Trial ERC-213, the estradiol and testosterone values remained below the above stated values.</p><p>See the Clinical Pharmacology Review for a full discussion of the pharmacokinetics findings in Trial ERC-213.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters were also collected in other completed DHEA clinical trials: in Canada), phase 3, placebo-controlled, double-blind, prospective trial which randomized a total of 558 postmenopausal women (463 postmenopausal women completed this trial) with moderate to severe dyspareunia self-identified as most bothersome in a 2:1 ratio between 0.50% DHEA insert (6.5 mg DHEA) and placebo. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic parameters were collected on Day 1 and Week 12 (or at discontinuation visit, if applicable) for measurement of DHEA and related steroids. Per the clinical trial report, the 12-week serum estradiol concentration was measured at 22% below the average normal postmenopausal value (3.26 vs 4.17 pg/mL in untreated women); serum estrone sulfate, showed similar serum levels observed in normal postmenopausal women (219 versus 220 pg/mL). Serum ADT-G, the major metabolite of androgens, remained within normal postmenopausal values. 4. In the 52-week open-label safety trial ERC-230, a total of 435 nonhysterectomized women (422 with end-of-trial endometrial biopsy reports) were exposed to daily administration of 0.50% DHEA (6.5 mg DHEA) for 52 weeks (including those women who received 0.50% DHEA in Trial ERC-231 and continued at this dose in Trial ERC-230). Serum samples were obtained at baseline and after 12, 26 and 52 weeks of treatment. Per the clinical trial report, "all serum steroids remained within normal postmenopausal values with no significant differences between different durations of treatment, thus indicating the absence of change over time in the metabolism of DHEA and its derivatives." "For the most relevant estrogen-related compounds, namely estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and estrone sulfate (E1-S), the values in the DHEA-treated group at 52 weeks were -3.4%, -9.1% and +1.8%, respectively, compared to the normal postmenopausal values found in untreated women." 5. Clinical Trial ERC-234, was a 12-week, multicenter (a total of 40 sites; 30 in the US and 10 in Canada), phase 3, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial designed to analyze the efficacy with respect to moderate to severe vaginal dryness, as self-identified most bothersome symptom, following the intravaginal administration of 0.25% DHEA insert (3.25 mg DHEA), 0.50% DHEA insert (6.5 mg DHEA) compared to placebo utilizing a reduced dosing regimen of daily administration for 2 weeks followed by twice-weekly (on Monday and Thursday) for 10 weeks (383 completers). Blood samples were collected at Day 1 and at Week 12 (or at discontinuation visit, if applicable) for measurement of DHEA and related steroids. All steroid assays were performed with validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays. Per the clinical trial report, for the Safety-S population, which include only the women having steroid measurements at both baseline and Week 12, all steroid values are well within the limits of normal postmenopausal women. The following summary of pharmacology and clinical pharmacokinetics is available in the Clinical Pharmacology Review:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Reviewer's Comments:</head><p>"DHEA (prasterone) is an endogenous steroid precursor that is secreted in the adrenal gland and is converted into active androgens and/or estrogens in peripheral tissues. The mechanism of action of prasterone vaginal insert in postmenopausal women with VVA has not been fully established.</p><p>The clinical pharmacokinetics of prasterone is summarized as follows:</p><p>Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacokinetics: Absorption: The absolute bioavailability of DHEA following administration of prasterone vaginal insert was not measured. Daily administration of 6.5 mg prasterone vaginal insert for 12 weeks increased the trough concentration (C trough ) of DHEA from 1.81 ng/mL at baseline to 2.67 ng/mL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distribution and elimination:</head><p>Human steroidogenic enzymes such as hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, 5a-reducatases and aromatases, transform DHEA into androgens and estrogens and their inactive metabolites. Androgen and estrogen metabolites transformed from DHEA are excreted as glucuronide or sulfone metabolite forms from systemic circulation. The treatment with 6.5 mg prasterone vaginal insert once daily for 12 weeks increased the C trough of testosterone from 148.1 pg/mL to 178.9 pg/mL and increased estradiol (E2) from 2.76 pg/mL to 3.28 pg/mL in postmenopausal women with VVA."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outstanding Issues:</head><p>Daily application of 6.5 mg prasterone vaginal insert leads to additional systemic exposure to testosterone and estrogens with DHEA. The mean serum C trough of DHEA, testosterone, estrone (E1) and E2 increased by 47%, 21%, 24% and 19% from baseline after treatment for 12 weeks in two phase 3 studies. The concentrations of those hormones in most subjects appeared to be within the normal ranges reported in postmenopausal women. However, it is not known whether the additional systemic exposures to androgen and estrogen metabolites following the use of prasterone vaginal insert in postmenopausal women would lead to any safety risk, including cardiovascular disorders and endometrial and breast cancer. It may warrant that a long-term safety monitoring in a larger population be evaluated, particularly for patients with a risk factor of hormone dependent disease."</p><p>The Clinical Pharmacology Reviewer recommends modifications to the applicant's proposed labeling for Intrarosa to include the pharmacology and pharmacokinetic information stated above. The applicant also performed a combined analysis of steroid data using the 12-week data from 5 out of 6 trials in the DHEA development program, excluding the data from the one-week trial ERC-213. The following clinical trials were pooled for the combined analysis of DHEA and related steroids:  Placebo: ERC-210, ERC-231, ERC-234 and ERC-238  0.25% DHEA: ERC-210, ERC-231 and ERC-234  0.50% DHEA: ERC-210, ERC-230 (Week 12 data), ERC-231, ERC-234 and ERC-238  1.0% DHEA:</p><p>ERC-210</p><p>The mean change from baseline for DHEA and related steroids in the combined analysis for the Safety-S population (those women having steroid measurements performed at baseline and up to 12-weeks post-baseline) are shown on <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 2</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Reviewer's Comments:</head><p>As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 2</ref> of combined 12-week trials, the DHEA mean change from baseline in the 0.50% DHEA treatment group exceeds that reported in the placebo treatment group (711.82 pg/mL versus 25.04 pg/mL, respectively). The same mean change from baseline is demonstrated for testosterone (24.9 pg/mL for 0.50% DHEA versus 0.08 pg/mL for placebo) and estrone sulfate (31.67 pg/mL for 0.50% DHEA versus 10.06 pg/mL for placebo). This data demonstrates an increase in the serum concentrations of DHEA, testosterone, and estrone sulfate, over that demonstrated in placebo, following administration of 0.50% DHEA vaginal inserts. The reported results for estradiol, however, shows a mean decrease at 12-weeks in the 0.50% DHEA treatment group (-0.09 pg/mL) in the Safety-S population.</p><p>See the Clinical Pharmacology Review for a full discussion of the pharmacokinetics findings in the DHEA development program.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1.6">Statistical Methodology</head><p>Unless otherwise stated, statistical analyses were performed at the two-sided significance (alpha) level of 0.025. The co-primary objectives analyzed are the changes in % of parabasal and superficial cells, vaginal pH and severity score of pain at sexual activity (dyspareunia). Efficacy analyses were performed primarily on the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population (all women who received at least one dose of trial drug with a baseline (Day 1) evaluation meeting the entry criteria), with additional secondary analysis done on the Per-Protocol (PP) population (a subset of the ITT population that completed the 12-week trial with no major protocol violations that could compromise the efficacy data). The primary analysis was performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with the treatment group as the main factor and the baseline value as the covariate. The ITT population consists of a total of 237 women: 77, 79 and 81 per treatment group for placebo vaginal insert, 0.25% and 0.50% DHEA vaginal inserts, respectively.</p><p>Safety analyses were performed on the safety population consisting of women who received any amount of trial medication and have any safety information available. Demographics and baseline characteristics were summarized and presented by treatment groups. The change from baseline (Day 1) to post-baseline assessments as well as differences from placebo was used for analysis. Analyses of differences between the placebo vaginal insert and 0.25% and 0.50% DHEA vaginal inserts were performed using an analysis of covariance with baseline as the covariate. All available safety data were used for analysis. For adverse events and laboratory data, standard methods of analysis were used. The safety population consists of a total of 253 women: 80, 86 and 87 per treatment group for placebo vaginal insert, 0.25% and 0.50% DHEA vaginal inserts, respectively. Per the trial report for Trial ERC-231 in the application, following the blinded review of steroid data for DHEA and its metabolites, the applicant developed a strong suspicion that some women had taken exogenous estrogens (an excluded concomitant medication) as indicated by finding marked elevations of serum estrogens (estradiol, estrone, estrone-sulfate) without parallel changes in serum DHEA as well as ADT-G, the main androgen metabolite. Prior to trial unblinding, the applicant established criteria to identify women for whom there was suspicion of having taken exogenous estrogens:</p><p>1. Women having ≥ 2 fold differences in serum estradiol (E2) levels (between Baseline and Week 12) where E2 levels are ≥ 10.0 pg/mL (for an upper 95% tolerance limit and 95% certainty, the 95th centile of normal postmenopausal women being 9. Per the applicant, all women meeting one of the above criteria were excluded from the PP analyses as this was considered a major protocol violation. The applicant also performed supportive analyses of the ITT and safety population excluding the women suspected of concomitant use of estrogens "in order to examine unbiased results." The analyses sets excluding these women are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_27">Table 4</ref> and are identified as "corrected ITT population" (cITT) and "corrected safety population" (cSafety). In addition, for analysis of steroid data in Trial ERC-231, the applicant identified additional subpopulations by adding the suffix "-S" (for example ITT-S, cITT-S, Safety-S and cSafety-S) for those women having steroid measurements at both baseline and Week-12.

The co-primary endpoints analyzed were the changes in percent of parabasal cells, percent of superficial cells, and vaginal pH in combination with pain at sexual activity self-identified by women as being her most bothersome symptom (MBS) of VVA. Efficacy analyses were performed primarily on the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population defined as all women who received at least one dose of trial drug (based on the diary card) with a baseline (Day 1) evaluation meeting the trial entry criteria (≤ 5% of superficial cells on vaginal smear, a vaginal pH above 5, and who have self-identified moderate to severe dyspareunia as their MBS).</p><p>The ITT population consists of a total of 482 women: 157 and 325 per treatment group for placebo vaginal insert and 0.50% DHEA vaginal insert, respectively. The primary analysis was performed using ANCOVA, with the treatment group as the main factor and the baseline value as the covariate. The p-value for the baseline adjusted least square mean (LSM) difference between groups was presented (specifically, p-values for the placebo versus 0.50% DHEA). Additionally, change from baseline for each treatment group was presented and assessed via a 1-sample t-test.</p><p>Based on Trial ERC-238 inclusion criterion number 6, it was expected that women would have sexual activity at least once during the trial evaluation period. Some women did not reports sexual activity at evaluations conducted at Weeks 6 and 12. Therefore, the applicant conducted an additional analysis on a modified ITT population (mITT) composed of women from the ITT population who had post-baseline sexual activity at least once before Weeks 6 and 12 (or discontinuation).</p><p>As in Trial ERC-231, women having a serum estrogen "signature" in Trial ERC-238 were excluded by the applicant from the PP analyses as this was considered a major protocol violation. In addition, the applicant performed supportive analyses of the ITT and safety population excluding the women suspected of concomitant use of estrogens "in order to examine unbiased results." The analyses sets excluding these women are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_34">Table 8</ref> and are identified as "corrected ITT population" (cITT) and "corrected safety population" (cSafety).

However, seventy-two women did not meet the stated inclusion criteria on Day 1 (23 were randomized to the placebo vaginal insert treatment group; 49 were randomized to the 0.50% DHEA treatment group). Per the applicant, these women continued to receive their assigned trial medication (placebo or DHEA) as randomized in order to obtain additional exposure and safety data, but they were not part of the efficacy analysis due to their lack of compliance with the trial entry criteria on Day 1. Therefore, 482 women made up the ITT population after 4 women were excluded because they did not present any post-baseline data (2 in the placebo treatment group lost to follow-up, and 2 in the DHEA treatment group: one lost to follow-up and 1 withdrew consent).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Summary</head><p>The safety population in this NDA consists of 1542 healthy postmenopausal women, with or without a uterus, exposed to 0.25% prasterone <ref type="bibr">(3.25</ref>  Although prasterone (DHEA) is not considered a new molecular entity (NME) by the Agency, it is a new chemical entity (NCE) for the proposed indication. Therefore, the Agency recommended, and EndoCeutics complied with, the ICH E 1 guidelines for premarket exposure for a drug product intended for chronic use.</p><p>In the prasterone (DHEA) development program, at total of 1196 healthy postmenopausal women were exposed to daily 0.50% DHEA (6.5 mg) vaginal insert with 521 women exposed up to 52 weeks. No deaths occurred in the six clinical trials. A total of 26 postmenopausal women experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) in the 0.50% prasterone (6.5 mg) treatment group (2.2%, 26 of 1196 women treated with 0.50% prasterone) compared with 5 postmenopausal women in the placebo treatment group (1%, 5 of 474 women treated with placebo). One SAE (invasive ductal breast carcinoma) in the 0.50% prasterone treatment group was considered possibly drugrelated to prasterone by the investigator. One reported case of breast cancer does not raise safety concerns for the 6.5 mg prasterone vaginal insert.</p><p>The long-term general and endometrial safety of the 6.5 mg prasterone vaginal insert was investigated in a primary, 52-week safety clinical trial (Trial ERC-230). Four hundred twenty-two (422) non-hysterectomized women had an evaluable end-of-trial endometrial biopsy performed (97%, 422 of 435 women). The reported findings of the three independent, blinded pathologists support the absence of substantial endometrial effects for the 6.5 mg prasterone vaginal insert administered intravaginally daily over a 52-week duration. One reported case of disordered proliferative endometrium in 422 end-of-trial endometrial biopsies at 52-weeks does not raise safety concerns for the 6.5 mg vaginal insert. Likewise, one reported functional polyp also does not raise safety concerns for the 6.5 mg vaginal insert.</p><p>Overall, no major safety issues related, specifically to 0.50% DHEA (6.5 mg prasterone), were identified in this review in four 12-week, The sNDA application contains an Integrated Summary of Safety (ISS). The safety population is defined as all women who received any amount of trial medication based on the woman's diary and/or drug accountability, and who had any post-baseline safety information available. Safety data are provided for 1,542 women exposed to DHEA vaginal inserts [0.25% DHEA (3.25 mg), 0.50% DHEA (6.5 mg), and 1.0% DHEA (13.0 mg)], and 474 women exposed to placebo vaginal insert in the 6 clinical trials performed in the DHEA development program.

Five (5) of the six trials were performed using a daily dosing regimen. Trial ERC-234 used a reduced dosing regimen (daily for 2 weeks, then twice weekly for 10 weeks). Four (4) trials had the same trial design and the same 12-week trial duration (ERC-210, ERC-231, ERC-234, and ERC-238).</p><p>See <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 15</ref> for the number and percentage of completers in the six clinical trials.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comments:</head><p>Overall, 89% of postmenopausal women completed their participation in the DHEA development program. Only 11% discontinued their participation. Discontinuations are discussed in Subsection 7.3.3 Dropouts and/or Discontinuations of this review.</p><p>The application includes a summary of the demographics and other baseline characteristics of the safety population. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 16</ref>, the six clinical trials completed had very similar populations of postmenopausal women with VVA. The safety population consisted mainly of White non-Hispanic women (92.2%; 1432 of 1542 women) followed by African American women (5.9%; 91 of 1452 women). Overall, the average age of the women enrolled in the safety population was 58.6 years with a median age of 58 and a range of 40 to 80 years. Similar age distributions are observed in all treatment groups. On average, the women measured 160.5 cm and weighed 68.2 kg with a BMI of 26.4. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comments:</head><p>The demographics and baseline characteristics of the women enrolled in the different DHEA treatment groups are similar. Caucasian women are overrepresented in the safety population while significant (with respect to the percentage of the U.S. population) minority groups are underrepresented. Given that the applicant utilized a large number of geographically distinct clinical site in the DHEA development program, this underrepresentation of minority groups remains unexplained. Methods utilized to advertise and recruit women may be a contributing factor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.2">Categorization of Adverse Events</head><p>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or a woman participating in a clinical investigation who administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.</p><p>In the application, adverse events (AEs) include all and any medical experiences, regardless of their relationship to the trial drug, including, but not limited to: 1) a newly diagnosed disease, 2) pregnancy, 3) medication overdose, 4) injury, 5) surgery (scheduled or not), 6) apparent unrelated illnesses, 7) clinically significant changes in clinical pathology parameters (serum chemistry, hematology), symptomatology, and physical signs other than pre-existing conditions. A worsening in intensity and frequency of a pre-existing condition was also considered an AE. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as AEs that started or worsened after the first dose of trial drug through 30 days after the last dose of trial treatment. The ISS analysis only includes TEAEs.</p><p>Adverse events that were recorded at Baseline were not considered TEAEs unless they increased in severity after initiation of dosing of trial medication. Adverse events that were reported in relation with the pre-dose Day 1 assessment (for example, abnormal laboratory values, ASCUS (Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance) on pre-dose Day 1 vaginal smear) were not considered TEAEs. The causal relationship between an adverse event and the investigational product was assessed by the Investigator based on his medical judgment as: unrelated, possible, and related.</p><p>The Investigator or designee had to promptly report any SAE to EndoCeutics using the SAE report form. SAEs were also reported on the CRF of the woman. All non-SAEs were documented on the CRFs of the trial. AE were monitored until 30 days after the completion of treatment (last dose). A phone call was made to women 30 days (30-37 days) after the last dose to inquire about AEs. The outcome of an adverse event was assessed by the investigator based on his/her medical judgment using the following definitions: recovered without sequelae, recovered with sequelae, ongoing, worsening.</p><p>In all trials included in the ISS analysis, AEs were recorded from the signature of the informed consent by the woman up to 30 days after the last dose of trial medication was taken. Therefore, for all trials in the DHEA clinical development program, TEAEs are those which occurred during a 4 month time-period, namely up to 12-weeks of treatment plus 30-day follow-up after the last dose was taken.  For the evaluation of the laboratory parameters, namely hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, and steroids (DHEA and metabolites), the ISS analysis combined, as indicated below, the 12-week safety data from 5 out of 6 clinical trials, excluding from the ISS analysis, the laboratory data from the one-week phase 1 PK trial ERC-213.

Although her 2005 history of microcalcifications in her left breast (no malignant changes identified) places her at increased risk, her baseline mammogram was reported as normal based on the absence of changes compared to her previous mammogram on December 2010. Therefore, it is not possible to completely rule out the 52-weeks of 0.50% DHEA vaginal insert exposure as a contributing factor to the May 2012 diagnosis of infiltrating carcinoma. It is interesting to note, however, that this woman had an increase in serum DHEA concentration at Week 52 (3825 pg/mL at Week 52 versus 1388 pg/mL on Day 1), but no appreciable increase in her serum estradiol concentration at Week 52 (5.0 pg/mL at Week 52 versus 4.4 pg/ml on Day 1).</p><p>Overall, the reported SAEs in 1196 women exposed to 0.50% DHEA vaginal insert up to 52-weeks do not raise concerns for the safety of the 0.50% DHEA vaginal insert for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, due to menopause.</p></div>

The safety population consists of 1,542 women exposed to DHEA and 474 women exposed to placebo. Discontinuations of women are based on the reason for discontinuation reported on the woman's case report form. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 19</ref> includes the reported findings from these 6 clinical trials. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Reviewer's Comments:</head><p>As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 19</ref>, the percentage of women who discontinued from the three DHEA treatment groups and the placebo treatment group are similar. The largest percentage of discontinuations occurred in the 0.50% DHEA treatment group, the largest represented treatment group in the DHEA clinical development program. "Subject withdrew consent" accounted for the largest number of discontinuations in the 0.50% DHEA treatment group, followed by adverse events, and "Other".</p><p>Overall, the most common reason for discontinuations in all DHEA treatment groups in the DHEA clinical development program was "Other", followed by adverse events. However, the discontinuation for "Other" was higher in the placebo treatment group (35%) than in the 0.50% DHEA treatment group (25%) and in the overall combined DHEA treatment groups (31%). The following information pertains to the 10 women who discontinued due to TEAEs in the placebo treatment group: The investigator assessed all symptoms as mild and possibly-related to trial medication. 9. Number 238-54-001 -A woman 60 years of age discontinued due to moderate mood changes and moderate aggressiveness. The investigator assessed these symptoms as possibly-related to the trial medication. 10. Number 238-54-020 -A woman 54 years of age discontinued due to moderate insomnia, moderate anxiety, mild nausea, and mild chest palpitations. The investigator assessed these AEs as possibly-related to trial medication.</p><p>In addition, Number 234-12-026, in the placebo treatment group, discontinued Trial ERC-234 due to a serious TEAE. This woman was being evaluated by a pneumologist for a history of progressive dyspnea which predated her participation in the trial. She did not declare this condition at Screening. She had a pre-scheduled ventilation/perfusion scan of the lungs that showed an embolism of a segment of the right inferior lobe (MedDRA preferred term, pulmonary embolism). This adverse event was reported as a serious TEAE. The woman was discontinued because this serious adverse event (SAE) violated the exclusion criteria for the trial. The investigator and applicant agreed that this adverse event was unrelated to the trial drug.</p></div>

Number 210-02-041 -A woman 62 years of age discontinued due to breast discomfort with a mild intensity, and mucous in her stool for 1 day. These AEs resolved spontaneously without medical treatment. The investigator assessed the breast discomfort as possibly-related, and stool mucous as unrelated to trial medication. The investigator assessed this AE as moderate in intensity and unrelated to trial medication 9. Number 234-50-004 -A woman 54 years of age discontinued due to a moderate lack of energy (asthenia) and moderate irritability after 5 doses of trial medication. The investigator assessed these AEs as unrelated to trial medication. 10. Number 234-60-021 -A woman 70 years of age discontinued due to mild urticaria. The investigator assessed this AE as unrelated to trial medication. 11. Number 231-26-001 -A woman 65 years of age was involved in a boating accident in which she sustained multiple injuries including a severe fracture of the T2-T4 thoracic vertebras (MedDRA preferred term, thoracic vertebral fracture). She underwent back surgery and was placed in a back brace. The woman also reported severe thoracic kyphosis (MedDRA preferred term, kyphosis). These adverse events were reported as serious TEAEs. She discontinued the trial because she was unable to perform trial related activities.</p><p>The investigator assessed these adverse events as unrelated to intravaginal DHEA.</p></div>

Although DHEA is neither an estrogen nor a progestogen, it can be converted to androstenedione, which in turn is interconverted to estrone, or to androstenediol, which can be converted to testosterone and then estradiol.</p><p>Endometrial safety was monitored in phase 3, 12-week placebo-controlled Trials ERC-210, ERC-231, ERC-234, and 52-week open-label Trial ERC-230. In each of these trials an endometrial biopsy was performed at baseline and at end-of-trial to evaluate endometrial histology. Phase 3 Trial ERC-238 conducted an endometrial biopsy at baseline only to prevent enrollment of a woman with abnormal endometrial histology in this 12-week trial.</p><p>Assessment of the histology from endometrial biopsy specimens was to be performed in accordance with the Agency's 2003 draft clinical evaluation Guidance for Industry as follows:</p><p> The endometrial tissue obtained by endometrial biopsy at screening, during the conduct of the trial, and at the end-of-trial will be processed in the same manner by a central laboratory.  A single pathologist reader (any one of the three blinded pathologists) will initially assess the slides from the endometrial biopsies obtained at screening (or because of participant bleeding) for a safety determination as to whether a woman should participate in the trial.  Women found to have endometrial hyperplasia or adenocarcinoma of the endometrium must be excluded from initial or further drug treatment (if discovered during trial drug treatment period) and referred for standard of care clinical management and followed to complete resolution, and the report of any medical or surgical procedures and the resultant pathology be provided to the Agency.  If hyperplasia is diagnosed by the single safety reader for a woman who has bled while on trial drug, the slides become part of the slide set given to the two other pathologists for reading.  Three independent expert pathologists, blinded to treatment group and to each other's readings should determine the final histologic diagnosis of slides from endometrial biopsy specimens obtained during the conduct of the trial for any woman who has an end-of-trial biopsy or a for cause biopsy because of bleeding while on trial drug.  The slide set distributed to each of the three pathologists for the end-of-trial pathology review incorporate control slides representing a randomly selected 10 percent of the screening normal slides and all slides from women excluded for the diagnosis of hyperplasia or cancer to insure quality control.  For the evaluation, the concurrence of two of the three pathologists will be accepted as the final diagnosis.

"Does the Agency agree that all slides of endometrial biopsies be evaluated by one additional expert pathologist while for biopsies with a diagnosis different from "inactive" or "atrophic", two additional pathologists would provide their diagnosis?" FDA Response: "No, we do not agree with your proposed evaluation of 50% of all slides by one additional blinded pathologist. We recommend that 100% of all endof-trial or discontinuation endometrial biopsy samples be evaluated by two additional, independent, blinded pathologists.

The finding of one case of disordered proliferative endometrium at the 1.0% DHEA dose also does not raise safety concerns. The applicant is not requesting approval of this dose for the stated indication.</p><p>Of interest however, are the following results of evaluation of serum steroid concentrations in the one case of disordered proliferative endometrium (trial participant Number 210-01-360): The applicant views this case as evidence of exogenous estrogen use. This reviewer agrees that the Week 12 serum estrogen levels are elevated above Day 1 while the Week 12 DHEA levels remain essentially the same as Day 1. The highly elevated estrogen levels and slightly elevated DHEA level at Day 14 remain unexplained, however. <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 24</ref> shows histology results, as reported in the July 12, 2016 amendment submission for ERC-237, from endometrial biopsies in women with treatment up to 52weeks in Trial ERC-230.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_27">Table 4</ref>, page 19 of 81. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">1</ref> Includes women who discontinued after 12 weeks but before 26 weeks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">2</ref> Woman identified by applicant as having an estrogen signature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Reviewer's Comments:</head><p>The reported findings of the three independent, blinded pathologists in clinical Trial ERC-230 support the absence of substantial endometrial effects for the 0.50% DHEA vaginal insert administered intravaginally daily over a 52-week duration. One reported case of disordered proliferative endometrium in 422 endof-trial endometrial biopsies at 52-weeks does not raise safety concerns for the 0.50% DHEA vaginal insert. Likewise, one reported functional polyp also does not raise safety concerns for the 0.50% DHEA vaginal insert. These findings do, however, demonstrate a known effect of estrogen on the endometrium. Throughout this application, the applicant asserts that "some women had taken exogenous estrogens (an excluded concomitant medication) as indicated by finding marked elevations of serum estrogens (estradiol, estrone, estrone-sulfate) without parallel changes in serum DHEA as well as ADT-G, the mail androgen metabolite."</p><p>For trial participants 230-02-028 and 230-15-020, their reported DHEA levels were higher at Week 52 than at Day 1. Likewise, their reported estradiol and estrone levels were also higher at Week 52 than at Day 1. These two cases represent an increase in DHEA and a correlated increase in estradiol and estrone. These reported outcomes refute the applicant insertion that these two women had an estrogen signature typical of a woman who took estrogen.</p><p>In spite of the limited occurrence of these events, consideration should be given to including these reported effects on the endometrium in product labeling. <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 25</ref> shows the overall final diagnoses of the three independent pathologists for combined 12-week Trials ERC-210, ERC-231, and ERC-234, and 52-week Trial ERC-230. first reader, did not provide the histologic characteristics on biopsy specimen and recommended follow-up.

The mean change from baseline for DHEA and related steroids in the pooled analysis for the Safety-S population (those women having steroid measurements performed at baseline and up to 12-weeks post-baseline) are shown on page 38 of this review.</p><p>The mean change from baseline for DHEA and related steroids in the combined analysis for the Safety-S population (those women having steroid measurements performed at baseline and up to 12-weeks post-baseline) are shown on <ref type="table" target="#tab_21">Table 36</ref>.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_21">Table 36</ref> demonstrates a mean increase in serum DHEA and testosterone levels, over baseline, at Weeks 26 and 52, for those women with data for these two time points. Likewise, a mean increase, over baseline, is observed for serum estrone and estrone-sulfate levels at Weeks 26 and 52, for those women with data for these two time points. These findings in 52-week Trial ERC-230 are consistent with the steroid findings in the combined 12-week ERC-231 and ERC-238 trials (see Subsection 4.4.3 Pharmacokinetics in this review) for DHEA, testosterone, estrone and estrone-sulfate levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Reviewer's Comments:</head><p>However, in 12-week Trials ERC-231 and ERC-238, the mean estradiol level increased 19% from 2.76 pg/mL to 3.28 pg/mL at Week 12. In 52-week Trial ERC-230, the mean estradiol levels decreased at both time points for those women with data for these two time points. This decrease in estradiol in Trial ERC-230 is not readily explained in light of the demonstrated increase in the levels of estrone-sulfate, a well-recognized parameter of total estrogen.</p><p>In Trial ERC-230, the concentrations of DHEA, testosterone, estrone, estronesulfate, and estradiol at Weeks 26 and 52 appear to be within the normal ranges reported for postmenopausal women. Nonetheless, these results demonstrate a systemic change, albeit minimal, in serum DHEA, estrogens and/or testosterone levels following the daily intravaginal administration of 6.5 mg prasterone vaginal insert.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4.3">Vital Signs</head><p>Per the statistical analysis plan for DHEA, any significant change to the vital signs and/or physical exam parameters were documented as a TEAE following administration of the first dose of trial medication and were reflected in the ISS analysis of TEAEs. Therefore, no additional ISS analysis was performed for vital signs and physical exam.</p><p>In 52-week Trial ERC-230, a total of 13 women developed intermittent hypertension during the clinical trial (blood pressure obtained at Screening, Day 1, Weeks 12, 26, 39, and 52) which returned to normal at Week 52. Two (2) women developed hypertension and remained hypertensive at Week 52 (Trial participant Numbers 230-05-007 and 230-35-011). Both of these women received drug therapy for their hypertension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Reviewer's Comments:</head><p>These two cases of hypertension do not raise safety concerns for the 0.50% DHEA vaginal insert.</p></div>

Therefore, no additional ISS analysis was performed for vital signs and physical exam.</p><p>No abnormal ECG findings were reported as TEAEs in the 6 trials conducted under the DHEA development program.</p></div>

The integrated analysis of TEAEs, SAEs, and laboratory parameters presented in Section 5 and Section 6, respectively, of this review provide information on the absence of effect of dose-response.</p><p>Clinical Reviewer's Comments: Seven (7) women experienced severe TEAEs at the 1.0% DHEA dosage strength in Trial ERC-210 including back pain, urinary tract infection, generalized abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, and vaginal burning and itching. One case of dizziness and hypotension was reported in 7-day Trial ERC-213 at the 1.8% DHEA dosage strength. However, these reported severe TEAEs do not clearly establish dose dependency for TEAEs in the DHEA development program.</p></div>

All trial participants had a natural menopause without hysterectomy. Twenty-eight (28) of trial participants had one or both ovaries removed (5%, 28 of 521 women). Two hundred sixty-eight (268) of trial participants had previously used hormone therapy (51%, 268 of 521 women).</p><p>In order to see a potential change in incidence of TEAEs over time or delayed adverse events, the applicant divided TEAEs in Trial ERC-230 into periods of 16 weeks (4 months). Safety data from the first 4 months of treatment is presented elsewhere in this review. (See Subheading 7.3.2 Nonfatal Serious Adverse events, and Subheading 7.4.1 Common Adverse Events.)

NDA 208470 INTRAROSA (prasterone) vaginal insert Health Research Clinic, Cleveland, OH), 5 in Quebec, Canada, and 1 in Montreal, Canada], placebo-controlled phase 3 dose-response trial conducted between June 28, 2007 (first woman enrolled) and May 23, 2008 (last woman completed trial). The primary objective of the trial was to determine the dose-response (minimal concentration) of DHEA having a maximal effect on vaginal mucosa parameters. Local activity of DHEA was measured by changes in vaginal epithelial cell maturation (parabasal and superficial cells), and changes in vaginal pH. In addition, selfassessment was made of the three symptoms of vaginal atrophy (moderate to severe vaginal dryness, vaginal and/or vulvar irritation/itching, and vaginal pain associated with sexual activity). The trial enrolled postmenopausal women (non-hysterectomized or hysterectomized), 40 to 75 years of age who self-identified at baseline, at least one moderate to severe symptom of vaginal dryness, vaginal and/or vulvar irritation/itching, or Vaginal pain associated with sexual activity (none, mild, moderate or severe), Two hundred eighteen (218) postmenopausal women were randomized to receive a daily dose of:  0.25% (3.25 mg of DHEA vaginal insert dissolved in Whitepsol H-15 base),  0.50% (6.5 mg of DHEA vaginal insert dissolved in Whitepsol H-15 base),  1.0% (13 mg of DHEA vaginal insert dissolved in Whitepsol H-15 base), or  Placebo vaginal insert (0 mg of DHEA dissolved in Whitepsol H-15 base.Additional details on the design and conduct of this trial are provided in Subsection 9.5.2 in this review.</figDesc></figure>

These women are identified as follows: 1. Number 210-02-035 -A woman 62 years of age, was seen in the emergency room on Day 11 with abdominal pain. She was hospitalized for symptomatic colelithiasis and underwent an endocholecystectomy. She recovered without sequelae and completed the clinical trial. The investigator assessed this SAE as unrelated to 0.25% DHEA vaginal insert. 2. Number 231-11-014 -A woman 64 years of age, noticed redness on her left hip on Day 34. She was seen in the emergency room and underwent an ultrasound of the left hip that showed a collection of fluid compatible with an abscess of the lateral face of the left major trochanter.

Number 231-26-001 -A woman 65 years of age, was involved in a boating accident and sustained multiple injuries including T2-T4 thoracic vertebral fracture. She underwent back surgery and was placed in a back brace. She discontinued the clinical trial. The investigator assessed this SAE as unrelated to trial medication. 4. Number 231-30-017 -A woman 52 years of age, was seen in the emergency room on Day 31 complaining of bright red blood in her stools. She underwent 4. Number 230-01-038 -A woman 62 years of age, with a medical history of dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, anxiety, insomnia, essential hypertension, and hypothyroidism. She was seen in the emergency room with epigastric pain, nausea, and diarrhea on (Day 183). Her gastroscopy was normal. She was hospitalized and treated (adjustment of her proton pump inhibitor medication), recovered without sequelae, and completed the clinical trial. The investigator assessed these SAEs and unrelated to trial medication. 5. Number 230-02-011 -A woman 66 years of age, with a history of hypertension, was seen in the emergency room with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and constipation on (first dose of trial medication on January 8, 2011). A duodenoscopy revealed a narrowing of the fourth segment of the duodenum compatible with Crohn's disease. She underwent a partial resection of the duodenum on . The woman elected to discontinue the trial. The investigator assessed this SAE as unrelated to trial medication. 6. Number 230-02-049 -A woman 61 years of age, was seen in the emergency room with abdominal pain and nausea on An abdominal and pelvic CT showed signs of appendicular peritonitis. She underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy, and recovered without sequelae. She completed the clinical trial. The investigator assessed this SAE as unrelated to trial medication. 7. Number 230-02-061 -A woman 55 years of age, with a history of a stereotactic biopsy of the right breast for microcalcifications (September 2005), had a pre-trial mammogram considered normal based on the absence of changes compared to the previous exam (December 2010). This woman reported a history of not taking hormone therapy. She took her first dose of trial medication on March 12, 2011; her last dose on February 29, 2012. Her Week 52 breast examination was normal. Her post-trial mammogram on Day 357 revealed a new cluster of polymorphic microcalcifications in the left breast, confirmed by a second exam performed at higher magnification. Following a stereotactic biopsy performed on , she had a segmental mastectomy with a final histologic diagnosis of infiltrating carcinoma positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors. The investigator assessed this SAE as possibly drugrelated to 0.50% DHEA vaginal inserts. The applicant disagrees "since breast tumors evolve over a much longer time period before reaching such stage. Moreover, DHEA inhibits breast tumor growth in numerous breast cancer models, including human breast cancer cells in vitro and tumors in vivo (Labrie, El-Alfy et al. 2003)." In addition, "this woman's serum steroid concentrations did not vary significantly and remained well within the normal postmenopausal range during the trial, including estrone sulfate, parameter of total estrogen activity which was lower at 52-weeks compared to baseline."</figDesc></figure>

Cytological findings were categorized as follows using the Bethesda system 6 for reporting cervical and vaginal cytologic diagnoses:  Atypical squamous cells  Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US)  Atypical squamous cells -cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H)  Low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LGSIL or LSIL)  High grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL or HSIL)  Squamous cell carcinoma  Atypical Glandular Cells not otherwise specified (AGC-NOS)  Atypical Glandular Cells, suspicious of AIS or cancer (AGC-neoplastic)  Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) For inclusion in the DHEA clinical trials, women had to have a normal Pap smear (which includes inflammatory changes) at Baseline or within the last 12 months. Women with Baseline cervical cytology showing atypia of squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or worse were excluded for trial participation. However, a woman was eligible for participation in the clinical trial if she had a Pap smear with a diagnosis of ASCUS at Baseline without a history of abnormal Pap smears within the last 2 years and a negative Human papillomavirus (HPV) test. Participating women also had an end-of-trial Pap smear performed in 52-Week Trial ERC-230.Per the applicant, abnormal cytological findings (for example, ASCUS or LSIL), observed on vaginal smears, collected to determine the percentage of superficial and parabasal cells, performed after Day 1 or later were documented as TEAEs in all clinical trials conducted. The Preferred MedDRA term for these TEAEs is "cervical dysplasia". The applicant cautions, however, that "atrophic vaginal cells can be reported as ASCUS".Treatment-emergent cervical dysplasia was reported in 6 women in the placebo treatment group (1.3%, 6 of 474 placebo-treated women) in 12-week clinical Trials ERC-210, ERC-231, and ERC-234. SeeTable 27.</figDesc></figure>

Treatment-emergent cervical dysplasia was reported in 8 women in the 0.25% DHEA treatment group (2.8%, 8 of 282 women treated with 0.25% DHEA) in 12-week clinical Trials ERC-231, and ERC-234.

None of these abnormal vaginal wall smears, or Pap smears, were considered related to the trial drug or placebo in the application.

Per the applicant, all of the 24 hour average estradiol concentration for 0.50%, 1.0%, and 1.8% DHEA inserts were below the 95 th centile of 9.27 pg/mL observed in untreated postmenopausal women. The AUC 0-24 value of serum testosterone shows no significant change at the 0.50% DHEA dose (2.79 ± 0.30 ng.h/ml on Day 7) versus 2.58 ± 0.33 ng.h/ml in the placebo group at Day 7. Per the application, these values translate into average serum testosterone levels over the 24h period of 0.11 ± 0.01 for the placebo group, and 0.12 ± 0.01 for the 0.50 DHEA group [N.S.,(not significant)], 0.19 ± 0.04 (N.S.) and 0.25 ± 0.03 (p&lt;0.01) ng/ml, respectively, in the placebo and 0.5%, 1.0% and 1.8% DHEA concentration groups Serum DHT increased from an AUC 0-24 value of 0.58 ± 0.07 ng.h/ml in the placebo group on Day 7 to 0.93 ± 0.11 (N.S.) for 0.50% DHEA vaginal insert on Day 7. These values correspond to average serum DHT levels of 0.02 ± 0.01 for the placebo vaginal insert, and 0.04 ± 0.01 for the 0.50% DHEA vaginal insert, both lower than the normal serum DHT levels of 0.07 ± 0.03 observed in premenopausal women, per the application. Per the final trial report, at Day 7, vaginal maturation value was significantly increased (increased by 107% [p&lt;0.01] for 0.50% DHEA) and vaginal pH was significantly decreased (decreased from 6.29 ± 0.21 to 5.75 ± 0.27 [p&lt;0.05] for 0.50% DHEA). Per the final trial report, there were no drug-related adverse events or clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters, except one urinary infection at screening only. Clinical Reviewer's Comments: The range for serum estradiol concentration in the normal postmenopausal women is often cited in textbooks and the published literature as 0-40 pg/mL. In 2006, in a clinical trial of 377 healthy postmenopausal women aged 55 to 65 years, the applicant reports a baseline (untreated) mean ± standard deviation</note></figure>

NDA 208470 INTRAROSA (prasterone) vaginal insert  Assess the long-term effects of DHEA vaginal insert on the symptoms and signs of vaginal atrophy by evaluating changes in the percentages of superficial and parabasal cells on a vaginal smear, vaginal pH and selfassessment of vaginal symptoms (questionnaire completed at baseline, Weeks 12, 26, 39, and 52).  Assess the tolerance to DHEA vaginal insert.  Assess the efficacy on arousal/lubrication, subjective arousal desire, pain at sexual activity, satisfaction and organism at screening, Day 1, Week 26, andWeek 52 using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire. No menses for at least one year for non hysterectomized women, or e) Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels &gt;40 IU/L or &gt; postmenopausal value of the laboratory where the FSH assay is performed (a woman with previously measured elevated serum FSH meets the inclusion criteria) in women with no menses &gt;6 months but &lt;12 months, or in hysterectomized women who were premenopausal at the time of hysterectomy, or f) Six months or more of Day 1 visit following bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy. 2. Have a normal mammogram within 9 months of trial start, normal breast examination, and normal Pap smear within the last 12 months (of Day 1). 3. Willing to participate in the trial and sign an informed consent. 4. Women who have self-identified at least one mild to severe of the following symptoms:  Vaginal dryness (none, mild, moderate or severe)  Vaginal and/or vulvar irritation/itching (none, mild, moderate or severe)  Vaginal pain associated with sexual activity (none, mild, moderate or severe) 5. Willing to have an endometrial biopsy at screening and end-of-trial. Use of estrogen alone injectable drug therapy or progestin implant within 6 months prior to study entry (screening visit). 7. Use of estrogen pellet or progestin injectable drug within 6 months prior to study entry (screening visit). 8. Oral estrogen, progestin or DHEA exposure or intrauterine progestin therapy in the 8 weeks prior to baseline assessments (screening visit). 9. Vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels or tablets) or transdermal estrogen alone or estrogen/progestin products in the 8 weeks prior to baseline assessment (screening visit).Women can washout as follows, but the questionnaire on vaginal atrophy must be answered after the required washout period:  At least an eight-week washout period for prior oral estrogen, DHEA and/or progestin therapy.  At least an eight-week washout period for prior transdermal hormone therapy.  At least an eight-week washout period for locally delivered hormone replacement therapy for vaginal dryness (rings, creams, gels or tablets).  At least 6 months for prior estrogen pellet therapy or progestin injectable drug therapy.  Eight weeks or longer for prior intrauterine progestin therapy.  Six months or longer for prior progestin implants and estrogen alone injectable drug therapy. 10. Cardiac failure or manifest coronary heart disease. 11. Hypertension equal to or above 140/90 mm Hg or not controlled by standard therapy. 12. Confirmed clinically significant depression or confirmed history of severe psychiatric disturbance. 13. The administration of any investigational drug within 30 days of screening visit. 14. Previous treatment with androgens or anabolic steroids within 3 months prior to screening visit. 15. Clinically relevant abnormal serum biochemistry, urinalysis or hematology.16.

Data from 10 women treated for 1 week with 1.8% DHEA in ERC-213 are not included. As shown inTable 34, the most commonly reported TEAE was application site discharge (7.1% for all DHEA doses studied compared to 3.4% in the placebo treatment groups). Per the applicant, application site discharge is likely "due to melting of the vehicle Witepsol with the possible addition of increased vaginal secretions stimulated by DHEA." This reviewer concurs that the melting of the Witepsol vehicle, and the effect of DHEA on increased vaginal secretion, both contribute to the occurrence of application site discharge. The relationship between the occurrence of application site discharge between the 0.25% DHEA dose (3.9%, 11 of 282 women treated at this dose) and the 0.50% DHEA dose (8.3%, 99 of 1196 women treated at this dose) is less clear, however. This difference may have been influenced by the reduced dosing regimen utilized in Trial ERC-234 (daily for 2 weeks, then twice weekly for 10 weeks).Urinary tract infection occurred similarly in all DHEA treatment groups (5.0%, 77 of 1542 DHEA women) and in the placebo treatment group (4.4%, 21 of 474 placebo-treated women) inTable 34.The occurrences of headaches, fatigue, hot flashes, vulvovaginal pruritus, abdominal and back pain are clearly elevated at the 1.0% DHEA (23.4 mg) dose. The applicant is not requesting approval of 1.0% DHEA.On April 21, 2016, DBRUP requested that EndoCeutics provide the pooled analysis of safety data obtained from the four 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical Trials ERC-210, ERC-231, ERC-234, and ERC-238 to examine the incidence of TEAEs in these placebo-controlled trials. EndoCeutics responded on April 28, 2016.</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="2">Primary System Organ Class</cell><cell>Placebo</cell><cell>0.25% DHEA</cell><cell>0.50% DHEA</cell><cell>1.0%

This analysis confirmed the efficacy of DHEA. The independent dose factor had values of DHEA of 0%, 0.25%, 0.5% and 1.0%. Given the significance of this analysis, the difference between each DHEA dose and placebo then was tested. Following the significant dose response analysis, analysis of variance was used to test each DHEA treatment group against placebo. Similar analyses were conducted on the most bothersome symptom and the gynecological evaluations of vaginal health, namely secretions, color, epithelial integrity and epithelial surface thickness.</p></div>
