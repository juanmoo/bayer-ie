<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and Recommendations</head><p>Empagliflozin has demonstrated efficacy for the 10-and 25-mg doses and the safety profile is similar to that of already approved SGLT2 products. If this application were to be based only on risk and benefit considerations, it could be approved. However, at present there is a withhold recommendation from compliance because of CMC issues at the manufacturing plant. As such, I recommend a complete response on this application. To resolve this action, the sponsor will need to successfully address issues identified by our compliance colleagues.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>3 significance of this change is uncertain (although the cardiovascular outcome trial may help to delineate).</p><p>As with other members of the SGLT2 class, empagliflozin had progressive reduction in efficacy as renal impairment increased.</p><p>In summary, efficacy was demonstrated for both empagliflozin 10-and 25-mg. There were numerically greater decreases of HbA1c for empagliflozin 25-mg compared to empagliflozin 10-mg. Empagliflozin was effective as add-on therapy with the other antidiabetic medications tested. As with other members of the SGLT2 class, there is progressive reduction in efficacy as renal impairment increases, and decreases of unknown clinical significance are noted in weight and blood pressure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety</head><p>The overall safety profile is similar to other members of the SGLT2 class. As with other SGLT2 agents, there were increased genitourinary infections, increased urination and in older subjects some volume depletion events and renal impairment.</p><p>The primary reviewer noted a differential in the incidence of lung cancer (different cell types), bladder cancer and melanoma. For lung and bladder cancer, the incidence was 4 (2108 pt-yrs exposure) and 3 (2108 pt-yrs exposure) respectively for empagliflozin compared to 0 (1019 ptyrs) for all comparators. Melanoma incidence was 3 (7872 pt-yrs exposure) compared to 0 (4184 pt-yrs exposure) for all comparators. The small number of events, differential in exposure and multiple different categories that are explored make evaluation of this imbalance for causality impossible. With such an evaluation, it is expected that there will be some categories whose results favor drug therapy and some that do not. This imbalance does not seem as extreme as that of others where we required more evaluation.</p><p>Attention was paid to any potential cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). There was some suggestion of a higher incidence of categorical transaminase shifts with drug therapy, but no definite cases fulfilling Hy's Law or DILI were identified. As such there is no indication that empagliflozin is likely to cause serious liver injury or dysfunction, although this will be further evaluated in the ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trial.</p><p>The cardiovascular evaluation was adequate and fulfilled the suggested recommendations outlined in the guidance to industry. <ref type="bibr">2</ref>   -Hazard ratio (95% CI) All Empa = all randomized empagliflozin; All Comp = all randomized comparator; MACE = major adverse cardiovascular event; CI = confidence interval; 3-point MACE (CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke), 5-point MACE (CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, and hospitalization for congestive heart failure), and 7-point MACE (CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, transient ischemic attack, and coronary revascularization procedures) Source: Tables 7.5.1: 1, 7.5.2.1: 1and 7.5.2.3: 1 (Interim cardiovascular safety meta-analysis)</p><p>The sponsor is currently completing a CVOT that should allow more precise characterization of cardiovascular risks (or perhaps benefits).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advisory Committee Meeting</head><p>An AC meeting was not held as empagliflozin is not the first drug approved in its class, the safety profile is similar to that of other drugs in the SGLT2 class, the clinical study design is acceptable and evaluation of safety data did not raise significant safety or efficacy issues that were unexpected for a drug of this class in the intended population. molecular weight is 450.91 g/mol. Information on drug substance specifications, batch analyses, reference standards and container closure system were considered acceptable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Drug Product</head><p>Empagliflozin tablets are manufactured in two strengths; 10 and 25 mg. The two strengths contain the same excipients,</p><p>. No novel excipients were used; all have compendial references and are identified in FDA's Inactive Ingredients Database as inactive ingredients found in other oral tablet products at levels higher than those found in empa.</p><p>Proposed release specifications include description (visual), identification (high pressure liquid chromatography <ref type="bibr">[HPLC]</ref> and ultraviolet), degradation products (HPLC), assay (HPLC), content uniformity, dissolution and microbiological quality. Batch analysis data from 29 clinical lots manufactured at commercial scale at the proposed site for commercial supply met the proposed specifications.</p><p>Dr. Leginus concurred with a shelf-life/ expiry of 36 months when empa is stored at room temperature.</p><p>Per Dr. Leginus, and Dr. Summan, the nonclinical reviewer, drug substance and drug product impurities were adequately qualified at or above the proposed limits in the specifications.</p><p>Both the drug substance and drug product are to be manufactured at the Boehringer Ingelheim facility in Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Facilities Inspection Issue Resulting in Recommendation to Withhold Approval:</head><p>On May 6 th , 2013, the FDA issued a Warning Letter to Boehringer Ingelheim (BI); this letter may be found at http://www.fda.gov/iceci/enforcementactions/warningletters/2013/ucm352325.htm . That Warning Letter refers to an inspection conducted November 5-12, 2012, which had identified "significant violations of current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) for the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and the cGMP regulations for finished pharmaceuticals, Title 21, U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 210 and 211". The letter states that the violations cause the APIs and drug products to be adulterated within the meaning of Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 USC 351(s)(2)(B).</p><p>The May 6 th letter cites several violations, namely:</p><p> "failure of your (BI's) Quality Unit to thoroughly investigate critical deviations in the manufacturing of your API"  "failure to conduct thorough complaint investigations regarding the presence of foreign particles found in your APIs"  failure "to reject drug products that did not meet established standard or specifications and any other relevant quality control criteria (21 CFR 211.165(f))", and  no dose adjustment needed for hepatic impairment; or based on drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies with metformin, glimepiride, sitagliptin, linagliptin, simvastatin, warfarin, ramipril, digoxin, hydrochlorothiazide, torasemide, or oral contraceptives.  although no pharmacokinetic DDIs were present for sulfonylurea, dose adjustment may be needed for coadministration with other insulin secretagogues, or insulin, to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia  monitoring of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels when empa is coadministered with organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3) transporter inhibitors, such as probenecid; or with uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) inducers, such as rifampin.</p><p>Other general aspects of the Clinical Pharmacology review are discussed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Absorption</head><p>After single dose administration of 10 mg or 25 mg empagliflozin tablets under fasted conditions, absorption was rapid, with a median Tmax of 1 hour. Thereafter, plasma levels declined in a biphasic fashion with a rapid distribution phase and a slower elimination phase. Exposure was dose-proportionate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Distribution</head><p>Steady-state volume of distribution ranged from 180 to 230 liters. After administration of 14Clabeled empa to healthy subjects, total radioactivity exposure in blood was lower compared to plasma, consistent with moderate red blood cell partitioning. Protein binding of total radioactivity ranged from 80.3 to 86.2%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Metabolism</head><p>No major metabolites were detected in human plasma. The most abundant metabolites were three glucuronide conjugates. Systemic exposure of each metabolite was &lt;10% of total drugrelated material. O-dealkylation gave rise to an active metabolite (EX 609); at the highest dose level, AUC and Cmax of this metabolite were approximately 0.12% of parent drug. The primary route of metabolism of empa in humans appears to be glucuronidation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">Elimination</head><p>Terminal elimination half-life was 12.4 hours. A mean of 54.4% of the dose was excreted in urine and 41.2% in feces. Approximately 50% of drug excreted in urine was unchanged parent. Steady state concentrations of empa were reached by the fifth dose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.">Intrinsic Factor Effects</head><p>No dose adjustment appears necessary for body weight, age, body mass index, race or gender. As noted above, however, the Clinical Pharmacology team recommends caution when using in the elderly. This is because the elderly may be more susceptible to adverse events related to mode of action of the drug, e.g. they may be more vulnerable to adverse events related to volume depletion. Pediatric studies have not yet been conducted; for the two approved SGLT2is, pediatric pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and clinical studies are Postmarketing Requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7.">Use in Renal Impairment</head><p>As eGFR declines, exposure to empa increases. However, the pharmacologic effect (glucosuria) is dependent on renal function, and the increase in exposure with eGFR does not overcome this dependence. Empagliflozin did not display a pharmacologic glucosuric effect in patients with an eGFR &lt;45 mL/min/1.73m 2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.8.">Use in Hepatic Impairment</head><p>In patients with hepatic impairment, empa exposure increases with degree of hepatic impairment (AUC 0-inf increased 23, 47 and 75% respectively for Child-Pugh mild, moderate and severe, compared to normal). There was an increase in fraction of drug excreted in urine without an effect on the amount or rate of urinary glucose excretion. Therefore, no dose adjustment was recommended in patients with hepatic impairment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.9.">Extrinsic Factors</head><p>Empagliflozin can be taken with or without food.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.10.">Drug-Drug Interactions:</head><p>Please see the key Clinical Pharmacology findings above.</p><p>A wide range of DDI studies was conducted. For most tested drugs, no dose adjustment is necessary.</p><p>As mentioned above, although no pharmacokinetic DDIs were present for sulfonylurea, dose adjustment may be needed for coadministration with insulin secretagogues, or insulin, to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Similar caution is recommended for the two approved SGLT2is.</p><p>When empagliflozin was coadministered with probenecid (an OAT3 inhibitor), the fractional excretion of empa was decreased. Monitoring of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels is recommended when empa is coadministered with OAT3 inhibitors.</p><p>Although single-dose coadministration with rifampin (a UGT inducer) was studied, multipledose coadministration was not. Therefore, the effect of UGT enzyme induction by rifampin on empa exposure could not be evaluated. Therefore, HbA1c monitoring is recommended if patients take rifampin or other inducers of UGT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Trials and Methods Used in the Efficacy Analyses</head><p>A total of six trials provided the main efficacy information for empa. One of these, an ongoing active control trial with glimepiride as a comparator, will not be discussed in the CDTL memo to protect the integrity of the ongoing trial. The other five trials are adequate to support the finding of efficacy for empagliflozin, without inclusion of discussion of the ongoing trial.</p><p>The following table lists the completed efficacy trials of empa: In all these trials, the primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c. Several secondary endpoints were also examined, including changes in fasting plasma glucose, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and body weight. The hierarchical testing order of these endpoints varied by study.</p><p>Across the pivotal efficacy trials, approximately 90% of patients completed the trial to the measurement of the primary endpoint. The percentage of discontinuations from the empa groups was lower than that for placebo groups. The most common reason for premature discontinuation was for adverse events, with a 4% overall discontinuation rate. Demographic characteristics were generally balanced between treatment groups. Overall 56% of patients were Asian, 41% were white, and 2% were black or African American. Efficacy for Asian and white patients was similar. The percentage of black patients studied is not reflective of the U.S. population; ideally more patients would have been studied. If empagliflozin is resubmitted, data from black patients enrolled in the ongoing CVOT will be considered. If these are inadequate, a Postmarketing Requirement for further study in African American patients could be considered; postmarketing study of under-represented minority patients has been conducted for other products (e.g. ezetimibe).</p><p>A last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) approach was used for analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints. Several sensitivity analyses were performed, and resulted in similar findings. These are further described in Dr. Liu's review, and included:  an observed case approach, in which all data were analyzed as observed, missing data were not imputed, and all values observed after rescue medication were excluded  an original results analysis, in which values obtained after start of rescue therapy were used as measured, and  a mixed model repeated measures approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Primary Efficacy Endpoint (Change from Baseline in Hemoglobin A1c)</head><p>The following table displays the primary endpoint results from the four trials with oral therapy.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_33">Table 3</ref> Study 1245.33 (add-on to insulin) had similar results for change from baseline to 18 weeks in HbA1c, with placebo-adjusted changes of -0.62 for empa 10 mg and -0.74 for empa 25 mg, with p values of &lt;0.0001.</p><p>Dr. Liu conducted subgroup analyses by age, gender, race, ethnicity, region, body mass index, baseline HbA1c, diabetes duration and renal function. In general, subgroup analyses were similar to the primary analysis. Some interaction was noted by age for the 25 mg empa dose (age &lt;50 years mean change in HbA1c = -0.86%; age &gt;75 years = -0.54%). Some interaction was also noted by gender for empagliflozin 25 mg (men -0.76%, women -0.58%). Differences in eGFR may have played a role in these subgroup differences. As discussed in the Clinical Pharmacology section, efficacy of empagliflozin declines with declining eGFR, as shown in 8. Safety</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.">Overall Recommendation of Safety Statistics and Clinical Safety Team</head><p>Please see the clinical review (DARRTS November 5 th , 2013) by Dr. Chong and safety statistical review by Dr. Charles (DARRTS November 1 st , 2013). Each reviewer recommends approval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.">Exposure</head><p>A total of 8400 patients have been exposed to any dose of empagliflozin in studies in patients with type 2 diabetes. Total patient-years of exposure for empa 10 mg are 3258, and for 25 mg are 4448. A total of 6594 patients have been exposed to the 10 or 25 mg dose for at least six months; a total of 4261 patients have been exposed for at least one year.</p><p>The primary safety grouping used in the clinical safety review was that of all studies conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes. This was designated the SAF-5 population, and included data from 18 studies. It included a total of 3630 patients exposed to empa 10 mg, 4602 exposed to 25 mg, and 4676 exposed to comparator (of whom 3522 were exposed to placebo). Non-placebo comparators included metformin (N=80), glimepiride (N=780) and sitagliptin (N=294). The following table provides additional details of exposure for SAF-5.  In addition, there were a total of nine cases in which a peak transaminase was ≥3x ULRR and total bilirubin was ≥2x ULRR. These cases are considered to be of special concern, and  For all patients who had an ALT ≥3x ULRR and a total bilirubin ≥2x ULRR, another etiology was present which appeared more likely than study drug to have been the cause of the patient's laboratory abnormalities.</p><p>At this time, there is not a clear liver safety signal with empagliflozin. However, the numerical imbalance in cases of ALT ≥3x ULRR with bilirubin ≥2x ULRR (although all cases seem to have another etiology), along with a small numerical imbalance in categorical shifts in transaminase values, will warrant continued evaluation of the hepatic safety of empagliflozin.</p><p>In the ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trial, which includes a large study population, hepatic events are being prospectively evaluated; this additional information will likely be of use in further assessment of empagliflozin's hepatic safety. Overall, malignancies occurred at a similar frequency among empa-treated and comparatortreated patients. There were two types of malignancies for which there was a numeric imbalance, not favoring empa. These were lung neoplasms and malignant melanoma.</p><p>Regarding lung neoplasms, Dr. Chong identified a total of seven cases which occurred six months or longer after randomization. All patients were treated with empagliflozin. The following table displays these cases:  <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 119</ref> above as this was coded to the "Non-small cell neoplasms malignant of the respiratory tract cell type specified" High Level Term; 2 Not included in Applicant's Table 2.1.5.8: 4 as lung cancer event occurred &gt; 7 days after last dose of study medication and the patient was only exposed to study drug for 167 days; 3 Was not a case of lung cancer, but was a case of colon cancer that was metastatic to the lung Source: Dr. Chong notes that Patient 809006 actually had colon cancer metastatic to lung, rather than a primary lung neoplasm. Patient 34564 appears to have had a recurrence of a prior lung cancer, which had occurred before randomization to empagliflozin. All the remaining patients were current or prior smokers.</p><p>Dr. Chong noted six cases of melanoma occurring 6 months or more after randomization. All patients were randomized to empa. The following table displays these patients: Of these six patients, two had a prior melanoma, one had multiple prior skin carcinomas, and one had "sun damaged skin".</p><p>Dr. Chang of the Division of Oncology Products was consulted regarding this imbalance in lung neoplasms and melanoma. She noted that these cases appeared to occur in high risk patients, and that it was unclear if this was a true signal or a chance finding. She recommended continued collection of clinical trial data in a long-term clinical trial. This will occur in Study 1245.25. She also recommended consultation with the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology regarding possible postmarketing pharmacovigilance approaches. In discussions with OSE Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology, it was noted that the lung neoplasms were of differing cell types, which would be very unusual for a drug-associated malignancy. They also stated that "enhanced" postmarketing pharmacovigilance methods would be unlikely to be of use for evaluation of these types of malignancies. In discussions with the nonclinical team, the nonclinical carcinogenicity evaluation appears to be adequate, and no new mechanistic studies were recommended.</p><p>The most appropriate approach to this question of an imbalance in lung neoplasms and melanoma appears to be continued evaluation in the ongoing CVOT, and should empagliflozin be approved, routine pharmacovigilance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.7.3.">Genital Infections</head><p>Genital infections, particularly mycotic infections, occurred more commonly among empatreated patients than among comparator-treated patients. To evaluate genital infections, the Serious genital infection events were uncommon (one empa 10 mg; two empa 25 mg; one placebo).</p><p>Discontinuations from study due to genital infection occurred for 14 patients treated with empa 10 mg, 15 patients treated with empa 25 mg, and one patient treated with placebo.</p><p>Most patients had a single episode of genital infection, but some patients had two or more. There was no dose-response relationship for risk of recurrence. which stands for major adverse cardiovascular events, and which includes cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.</p><p>The following table displays the results from the meta-analysis:   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">................................................................................................................. 6   TABLE OF FIGURES ................................................................................................................ 14   ABBREVIATIONS .................................................................................................................</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Risk Benefit Assessment</head><p>While there are a number of therapeutic products available for use in treating T2DM, there remains a need for new therapies. To evaluate the benefits of empagliflozin versus the risks of empagliflozin, it is first necessary to discuss the expected benefits and the potential risks.</p><p>The Applicant has shown empagliflozin to be effective in reducing glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) as monotherapy and as add-on to a variety of antidiabetic regimens (including metformin, metformin + sulfonylureas, pioglitazone, and basal insulin). In the pivotal phase 3 studies, the mean placebo-adjusted change in HbA1c ranged from -0.48% to -0.73% with empagliflozin 10 mg and from -0.59 to -0.84% with empagliflozin 25 mg. This translates to improved glycemic control which should lead to a reduction in diabetic complications, based on the likely benefits of glycemic control demonstrated in such trials as the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial 1 and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study 2 . Empagliflozin also showed a mean reduction in body weight compared to placebo, which is an important difference compared to antidiabetic agents from some other classes. While the 25 mg dose demonstrated a numerically greater reduction in HbA1c than the 10 mg dose, the difference between the two doses is of questionable statistical and clinical significance.</p><p>There were adverse events seen with a greater incidence in the empagliflozin-treated patients compared to the placebo/comparator-treated patients. There was an increased incidence of NDA-204629 Jardiance (empagliflozin) Primary Clinical Review William H. Chong 20 genitourinary infections, particularly mycotic infections, with empagliflozin treatment. These were treatable with standard therapies in the development program. Additional adverse events (AEs) seen more frequently with empagliflozin included dry mouth, thirst, and increased urination. Increased age appears to be a factor which increases the risk for these AEs, particularly with the 25 mg dose. Decreases in renal function were seen with empagliflozin therapy, particularly in patients of increased age or with moderate renal impairment at baseline. The observed changes in renal function with empagliflozin treatment appear to be reversible following cessation of therapy. I feel that these issues are primarily tolerability issues, and they do not generate sufficient concern to offset the expected benefit from improved glycemic control.</p><p>In considering the dose for approval, it is notable that the 10 mg dose demonstrated a lower incidence for some of these events compared to the 25 mg dose, particularly in patients of increased age and/or with renal impairment at baseline.</p><p>Additional safety concerns that were considered during this review include the effect of empagliflozin on the liver, and on the development of malignancies.</p><p>While there was no evident imbalance in the reported liver adverse events, an imbalance in the number of patients with liver enzyme elevations between empagliflozin and placebo/comparator was seen in the development program. More patients receiving empagliflozin met the biochemical criteria for Hy's law 1 , but all of these cases could be plausibly explained as a result of an alternative etiology. There does not appear to be a risk of severe, acute drug-induced liver injury with empagliflozin based on the clinical data presented.</p><p>A small imbalance in certain malignancy events was seen in the development program. There were more cases of lung cancer and more cases of melanoma occurring after 6 months of treatment in the empagliflozin-treated patients than in the placebo/comparator-treated patients.</p><p>The initial imbalance was concerning as zero patients reported these events in the comparator arms, but further review of the cases assuaged my concern for potential carcinogenicity with empagliflozin. Most of the cases had pre-existing risk factors for these malignancies. There is also no mechanistic basis for the development of lung cancer or melanoma with empagliflozin. There does not appear to be a clear risk of carcinogenicity with empagliflozin based on the data presented.</p><p>1 Hy's law: (1) the drug causes hepatocellular injury, generally shown by more frequent ≥ 3x elevation above the upper limit of the reference range (ULRR) in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase, (2) Subjects with transaminases &gt; 3x ULRR also show elevation of total bilirubin &gt; 2x ULRR without findings of cholestasis (i.e. alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2x ULN), and (3) no other reason can be found to explain the laboratory abnormalities NDA-204629 Jardiance (empagliflozin) Primary Clinical Review William H. Chong</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>21</head><p>Cardiovascular safety is discussed in more detail in a separate section from the main review, due to inclusion of interim data from an ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trial and the need to protect the integrity of that trial. A preplanned meta-analysis of major adverse cardiovascular events, which includes interim data from the ongoing cardiovascular safety study, excluded an upper bound of 1.8 for the 95% confidence interval.</p><p>Hypoglycemia is a concern with any antidiabetic therapy. In the empagliflozin development program, there was no increased risk for hypoglycemia when empagliflozin was used as monotherapy. There was an increased incidence in hypoglycemia when empagliflozin was added to antidiabetic agents with hypoglycemic potential (i.e. sulfonylureas). Adjustment to sulfonylurea and/or insulin doses should be considered when adding empagliflozin to either of these agents, to mitigate this risk.</p><p>Some changes in laboratory tests were seen with empagliflozin treatment. There was an increase in low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), total cholesterol (TC) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL). Increases in hematocrit were also seen. Other laboratory test changes included increases in serum phosphate and serum lipase, and decreases in serum bicarbonate. There was no evident clinical effect from these changes.</p><p>Based on review of the available data, I feel that empagliflozin should be approved. The expected benefit from improved glycemic control exceeds the potential risks of therapy. Though only the 25 mg dose is proposed by the Applicant, I feel that both of the studied doses (i.e. 10 mg and 25 mg) should be approved.</p><p>For the 10 mg dose, the Applicant has demonstrated proven efficacy in reducing HbA1c, and a safety profile that does not suggest serious risks that would exceed the expected benefit with therapy. Though the difference in HbA1c reduction of the 25 mg dose compared to the 10 mg dose does not achieve statistical significance, it is important to note that this is based on a mean and that there will be some patients who could have further clinically significant reduction in HbA1c with this dose. The greater percentage of patients achieving the target HbA1c of &lt; 7.0% also supports approval of the 25 mg dose. Though there is an increase in the incidence of some AEs with the 25 mg dose, these appear to be more issues of tolerability and not serious safety concerns. Limiting the 25 mg dose to patients who are not elderly or do not have renal impairment may mitigate some of the observed increases in adverse events with the 25 mg dose. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Product Information</head><p>Empagliflozin is a sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor developed for use in the treatment of T2DM. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a disease of impaired glucose regulation due to impaired insulin action and insulin resistance. Management of T2DM focuses on glycemic control, and involves lifestyle changes (diet and exercise) as well as use of currently available antidiabetic drugs (see 2.2). Sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter-2 is a transporter found in the proximal renal tubule, and is responsible for renal glucose reabsorption. Inhibition of this transporter increases glucosuria which in turn should result in improved glycemic control. </p></div>

Based on single dose studies in rodents, the acute toxicity in rats was low as indicated by a lethal dose of &gt; 2000 mg/kg. Exposures achieved in chronic studies in mice, rats, and dogs were up to 62x, 35x, and 240x (respectively) of those seen with the maximum recommended human dose of 25 mg once daily.</p><p>Across the different species, toxicity was consistent with the mechanism of action. In addition to the expected urinary glucose loss, other findings included polyuria, decreased body weight/fat, increased food consumption, diarrhea, dehydration, decreased serum glucose, electrolyte imbalances, and increases in parameters reflecting increased protein catabolism and gluconeogenesis. Changes were consistently observed in the kidneys, and included tubular karyomegaly, cell necrosis, cystic hyperplasia/hypertrophy, renal mineralization, and tubular nephropathy and interstitial nephritis. Based on toxicology studies in male mice, male rats, and dogs, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for systemic toxicity was 47x, 10x, and 18x (respectively) the exposure expected to be seen with a daily therapeutic dose of 25 mg once daily.</p><p>Two-year carcinogenicity studies were performed in CD-1 mice and Wistar (Han) rats. In female CD-1 mice, there was no evidence of carcinogenic potential at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (62x the clinical exposures in humans at 25 mg once daily). In male CD-1 mice, empagliflozinrelated renal adenoma/carcinoma occurred at doses of 1000 mg/kg/day but not at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (11x the clinical exposures in humans at 25 mg once daily). In female Wistar rats, the evidence of carcinogenicity was seen at doses up to 700 mg/kg/day (72x the clinical exposures in humans at 25 mg once daily). In male Wistar rats, benign vascular tumors NDA-204629 Jardiance (empagliflozin) Primary Clinical Review William H. Chong</p></div>

It is noted that these tumors are common in the male Wistar rat, and the relevance of this finding is unclear. Benign testicular interstitial cell tumors were observed in the male rats at doses of 300 and 700 mg/kg/day, but the incidence was not dose-related and there was no associated hyperplasia. The applicant postulates that these tumors are secondary to severe body weight loss. Similar findings were seen in the canagliflozin development program.</p><p>Developmental and reproductive toxicity was studied in rats and rabbits. There were no effects on fertility or early embryonic development in rats at exposures ≥ 155x the clinical exposures in humans at 25 mg once daily. Teratogenicity was not seen with empagliflozin in rats or rabbits at exposures &gt; 48x the clinical exposures in humans at 25 mg once daily. The pre-and post-natal development toxicity study showed the NOAEL for maternal systemic toxicity and for growth of the F1 generation was 16x and 1x the clinical exposures in humans at 25 mg once daily. Empagliflozin has not been found to be a dermal sensitizer, dermal irritant, or ocular irritant. No potential for phototoxicity was seen.</p><p>Evaluation of impurities did not identify any genotoxic potential. No immunotoxic potential has been seen for empagliflozin.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.1">Mechanism of Action</head><p>Approximately 90% of renally filtered glucose is reabsorbed via SGLT2 in the proximal tubule. Inhibiting SGLT2 decreases renal reabsorption of glucose leading to increased urinary glucose excretion and, as a result, reduced blood glucose levels. Empagliflozin is an oral, selective SGLT2 inhibitor developed to utilize this pathway in the treatment of patients with T2DM. The action of empagliflozin is independent of β-cell function and insulin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.2">Pharmacodynamics</head><p>Urinary glucose excretion was increased in a dose-dependent manner in patients with T2DM who were given empagliflozin, and the average renal glucose threshold decreased in a dosedependent manner <ref type="table" target="#tab_33">(Table 3)</ref>. With this increase in urinary glucose excretion, there was an increase in mean urine volume, and an increase in urinary frequency (one to two voids per day). Plasma glucose was reduced in empagliflozin-treated groups compared to placebo. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) decreased after a single dose, and this was maintained over the treatment period.</p><p>Studies of the QT interval did not demonstrate QT(c) interval prolongation following single oral doses of empagliflozin (therapeutic (25 mg) and supra-therapeutic (200 mg)). This is further discussed in Section 7.4.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.3">Pharmacokinetics</head><p>Following oral administration in healthy volunteers and in patients with T2DM, empagliflozin is rapidly absorbed and reaches peak plasma concentrations (C max ) at 1.5 hours after the dose. With a 25 mg dose given once daily, mean steady state plasma area under the curve (AUC) was 4740 nmol*h/L with a C max of 687 nmol/L. Administration following a high-fat, high-calorie meal resulted in slightly lower exposures (AUC -16%, C max -37% compared to administration in the fasting state Hepatic function also affects plasma levels of empagliflozin. In a single-dose study in subjects with varying degree of hepatic impairment (i.e. Study 1245.13), the AUC of empagliflozin increased by 23%, 47%, and 75% while C max increased by 4%, 23%, and 48% with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment (by Child-Pugh classification), respectively. Notably, the increases in AUC did not correlate with increases in urinary glucose excretion. The Applicant does not feel that these changes are meaningful and recommends no dose adjustment in liver disease.</p><p>Other intrinsic factors studied include gender, age, race, and body mass index (BMI). None of the observed changes with any of these factors was felt to be clinically meaningful by the Applicant.</p><p>Drug-drug interaction studies showed similar PK profiles for empagliflozin when given with or without metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, linagliptin, simvastatin, warfarin, verapamil, ramipril, hydrochlorothiazide, and torsemide. Small increases in overall clinical exposure were noted when empagliflozin was coadministered with gemfibrozil, rifampin, and probenecid. No clinically relevant effect was seen on PK profile for metformin, glimepiride, sitagliptin, linagliptin, simvastatin, warfarin, ramipril, digoxin, hydrochlorothiazide, torsemide, or oral contraceptives when coadministered with empagliflozin. Mixed results were seen for the PK profile of pioglitazone when coadministered with empagliflozin. One of two studies showed an increase in the overall exposure of pioglitazone and its metabolites when coadministered with empagliflozin 50 mg. The second study showed no clinically relevant effect of empagliflozin (10, 25, or 50 mg) coadministered with pioglitazone on the PK profile of pioglitazone and its metabolites.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_26">Table 4</ref> is a listing of all the clinical studies performed by the Applicant to support the NDA.

The appendices to the SCE and SCS (i.e. the integrated summary of efficacy (ISE) and integrated summary of safety (ISS)) were referenced as needed. Issues and concerns identified from the clinical summaries were addressed by in-depth review of the submitted study reports, narratives and datasets. The efficacy data from the pivotal phase 3 trials were reviewed individually and as a pool. Safety findings from the pooled pivotal phase 3 trials and from the larger pool of all patients with T2DM were reviewed.</p><p>All of the submitted narratives for deaths and nonfatal serious adverse events (SAEs) were reviewed.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Discussion of Individual Studies/Clinical Studies</head><p>The Applicant identifies four studies as pivotal studies: <ref type="bibr">1245.19, 1245.20, 1245</ref>.23 met , and 1245.23 met+SU . These studies were 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with change in HbA1c as the primary endpoint. Two doses were studied in these studies (10 mg and 25 mg). Study 1245.19 compared empagliflozin with placebo as add-on to pioglitazone (with or without metformin). Study 1245.20 compared empagliflozin with placebo as monotherapy. Study 1245.23 met compared empagliflozin with placebo as add-on to metformin. Study 1245.23 met+SU compared empagliflozin with placebo as add-on to metformin plus a sulfonylurea. While Studies 1245.23 met and 1245.23 met+SU were performed under one protocol and study number and the results were submitted as a single study report, the Applicant considers them independent, individual studies for the purpose of the NDA. Study 1245.31 is a long-term extension of these 4 studies and provides additional supportive, long-term information. Aside from the differences in background therapy, the inclusion/exclusion criteria were similar for the four pivotal phase 3 studies. -Uncontrolled hyperglycemia (FPG &gt; 240 mg/dL on two separate measurements) -Myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 3 months prior to informed consent -Liver disease (defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or alkaline phosphatase &gt; 3x upper limit of reference range (ULRR)) -eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min -Bariatric or other gastrointestinal surgeries that result in chronic malabsorption within two years prior to informed consent -Blood dyscrasias -History of cancer (except for basal cell carcinoma) and/or treatment for cancer within five years -Antiobesity drugs or any other treatment leading to unstable body weight -Systemic steroids at time of informed consent -Change in dosage of thyroid hormones within six weeks prior to informed consent -Any other uncontrolled endocrine disorder (except T2DM) -Alcohol or drug abuse in the three months prior to informed consent In addition to these studies, data from five supportive phase 3/phase 3-equivalent studies are submitted: 1245.25 (cardiovascular outcomes study, 10 mg and 25 mg), 1245.28 (empagliflozin vs. glimepiride, 25 mg only), 1245.33 (add-on to basal insulin, 10 mg and 25 mg), 1245.36 (empagliflozin in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, 10 mg and 25 mg), and 1245.48 (empagliflozin in patients with hypertension, 10 mg and 25 mg). Supportive data are also provided by two phase 2 studies (1245.9 -12 week double-blind, placebo controlled, monotherapy study (5 mg, 10 mg, and 25 mg), 1245.10 -12 week double-blind, placebo controlled, add-on to metformin study (1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg)) and their openlabel extension (1245.24, 10 mg and 25 mg).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Summary</head><p>The Applicant has demonstrated that empagliflozin has greater efficacy in reducing HbA1c compared to placebo at both the 10 mg dose and the 25 mg dose. In the pivotal phase 3 studies, the mean placebo-adjusted change in HbA1c ranged from -0.48% to -0.73% with empagliflozin 10 mg and from -0.59 to -0.84% with empagliflozin 25 mg. While there were only slight differences between the 10 mg and 25 mg dose on the reduction in HbA1c, there are sufficient supportive findings of efficacy to support approval of both doses. In particular, treatment with the 25 mg dose resulted in a greater percentage of patients achieving an HbA1c &lt; 7.0% compared to the 10 mg dose, and there was a reduced need for rescue medication with the 25 mg dose. Additional outcome measures assessed in the clinical studies included change in fasting plasma glucose, change in body weight, and change in blood pressure parameters. Greater reductions compared to placebo were seen for all of these endpoints with empagliflozin treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Indication</head><p>Empagliflozin is proposed for use as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with T2DM either as monotherapy or as add-on to other antidiabetic treatments. The standard indication for drugs to treat T2DM does not specifically indicate use as monotherapy or as add-on therapy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.1">Methods</head><p>The clinical studies supporting the NDA were grouped into two efficacy groupings by the Applicant <ref type="table" target="#tab_30">(Table 5</ref>). Efficacy Grouping 1 (EFF-1) is the pool of Studies 1245.19, 1245.20, and 1245.23 met up to 24 weeks. This grouping corresponds to the safety grouping SAF-2 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure  16</ref>). Exclusion of data from Study 1245.23 met+SU was done to allow for risk-benefit assessment of patients not taking sulfonylureas, as this population was expected to have a higher risk for  Primary efficacy analyses followed the intent-to-treat principle and were based on the full analysis set (FAS) which included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication and had a baseline HbA1c measurement. A per-protocol set (PPS) was defined at the study level, but in general comprised all patients from the FAS who did not have any important protocol violations. The main analyses of efficacy used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models and a last observation carried forward (LOCF) method for imputation of missing data. Baseline HbA1c was a covariate, while treatment, renal function, geographical region, and study number were fixed effects. For categorical responder analyses, missing data were imputed using the noncompleters considered failure (NCF) approach. Sensitivity analyses NDA-204629 Jardiance (empagliflozin) Primary Clinical Review William H. Chong 39 included evaluation of the PPS with LOCF, a full analysis set -observed cases (FAS (OC)) and full analysis set -observed cases, including values after rescue medication (FAS (OC-IR)) using the mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) approach.</p><p>This review will focus on the efficacy results of the four pivotal studies and the efficacy grouping, EFF-2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2">Demographics</head><p>In the efficacy groupings EFF-1 and EFF-2, there were a total of 1,811 and 2,477 patients, respectively, treated with randomized study medication <ref type="table" target="#tab_31">(Table 6</ref>). Baseline demographics were balanced in each individual pivotal study, as well as for the pooled efficacy groups <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 7)</ref>. Study 1245.20 also included an active comparator arm using sitagliptin. Baseline demographics for this group were similar to the empagliflozin-and placebotreated patients in this study (not shown. See <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table 11</ref>.2.1: 1 of the study report for Study 1245.20). Between the different pivotal studies, small differences in baseline demographics were observed. There were more patients with a longer duration of disease in the add-on studies (1245.19, 1245.23 met , and 1245.23 met+SU ). This was likely due to differences in the eligibility criteria for each study. There was a higher percentage of males in Study 1245.20 than in other studies. There was also a higher percentage of Asian patients in Study 1245.20 than in other studies. There were more White patients in Study 1245.23 met than in other studies.

At least one dose of randomized study treatment was given to 2,700 patients. In each of the pivotal studies and in the two efficacy groupings (EFF-1 and EFF-2), premature discontinuation was more common in the placebo-treated patients ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table  8</ref>). The most common reason for premature discontinuation was not continuing on to the extension study. The most common reason for not continuing on to the extension study was reported as "Other" <ref type="table">(Table 9</ref>). Discontinuation due to an AE was the next most common reason for premature discontinuation. This was more common in the placebo group (with the exception of Study 1245.23 met+SU where the 25 mg dose had a higher incidence of discontinuation due to AE). Between the two doses of empagliflozin, premature discontinuation due to an adverse event occurred with the Empa 25 group at an incidence greater or equal to that seen in the Empa 10 group for all of the individual studies and the efficacy groupings, EFF-1 and EFF-2. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment on Dose Dependence for Efficacy: Though there was a numerically greater reduction in HbA1c for the 25 mg dose compared to the 10 mg dose, the comparison of efficacy between the two doses demonstrated no statistical difference between them on the ability to reduce HbA1c. However, the 25 mg dose appears more effective in reducing HbA1c &lt; 7% if it was ≥ 7% at baseline, and there was a statistically significant greater reduction in fasting plasma glucose (though the reduction is of questionable clinical relevance given the HbA1c findings). Subjects from the 25 mg dose treatment arm also required less rescue medication. While the Applicant has proposed the 25 mg dose only, I feel that the 10 mg dose has demonstrated clinical effectiveness and should be</head><p>approved. There are some limitations with regard to the available data for the 10 mg dose, specifically the limited data for the 10 mg dose in the setting of moderate renal impairment. Given that there are some differences in the safety profiles of the 10 mg and 25 mg dose not favoring the 25 mg dose (discussed below); the lack of further HbA1c reduction with the 25 mg dose raises a question regarding the approvability of the 25 mg dose. However, I feel that the improvement in categorical response and decreased use of rescue medication with the 25 mg dose supports approval of the 25 mg dose as well.</p></div>

For older patients (i.e. &gt; 75 years old), there was an increase in volume depletion events and renal impairment. Hypoglycemia was not more frequent with empagliflozin compared to placebo when administered as monotherapy, or as add-on to metformin or pioglitazone. An increased incidence of hypoglycemic events was seen when empagliflozin was added to sulfonylurea therapy. These appear to be issues of tolerability rather than issues that would impede approval. The genital infections were treatable with standard therapies in the development program, and the changes in renal function were reversible with cessation of therapy.</p><p>Cardiovascular safety will be discussed separately from this summary due to inclusion of interim data from an ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trial, and the need to protect the integrity of that trial. A preplanned meta-analysis of major adverse cardiovascular events excluded an upper bound of 1.8 for the 95% confidence interval. This meta-analysis includes data from an interim analysis of a still-ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trial.</p><p>Two areas of questionable concern were identified during the review of empagliflozin. These are (1) drug-induced liver injury (DILI), and (2) malignancy events (specifically lung cancers and melanomas). For both of these, there was an imbalance in the number of empagliflozintreated patients compared to placebo/comparators. Review of additional details for the individual cases provides reassurance that these imbalances are unlikely to be the result of treatment with empagliflozin.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>92</head><p>In the phase 3 studies, "significant adverse events" were prespecified and defined. These events were:</p><p>1. Decreased renal function (creatinine ≥ 2x baseline and above ULRR) 2. Hepatic injury (AST and/or ALT ≥ 3x above ULRR, combined with bilirubin ≥ 2x above ULRR measured from the same sample) if not meeting the definition of "serious".</p><p>"Other significant AEs" as defined in ICH E3 include marked hematological and other laboratory abnormalities (if not meeting the definition of "serious"), and any event leading to an intervention (including withdrawal of study treatment, dose reduction, or significant additional concomitant therapy).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.3">Pooling of Data across Studies/Clinical Studies to Estimate and Compare Incidence</head><p>For analysis of safety data, the Applicant has grouped the clinical studies (Table 49, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 16</ref>). The rationale for these specific groupings is as follows:</p><p>1. SAF-1 allows for assessment of the safety of empagliflozin as monotherapy. 2. SAF-2 and SAF-3 allow for direct comparison of safety and efficacy groupings as they correspond to the efficacy groupings EFF-1 and EFF-2 respectively. 3. SAF-4 allows for the safety assessment of empagliflozin in patients with T2DM without confounding comorbidities. 4. SAF-5 comprises the largest pool of data and allows for subgroup analysis and identification of rare AEs. 5. SAF-6 allows for assessment of the AEs in healthy subjects.</p><p>Studies in patients with renal impairment (1245.12), hepatic impairment (1245.13), drug-drug interaction (DDI) with diuretics (1245.42), and DDI with rifampicin and probenecid (1245.83) were not included in any of the above groups due to either: (1) no appropriate group being available <ref type="bibr">(1245.12, 1245.13, 1245.42)</ref>, or (2) the study was completed too late for grouping (1245.83).</p><p>Safety grouping SAF-5 will be the focus of this review as it comprises the largest group of patients with T2DM and encompasses all other safety groupings that examine patients with T2DM. To facilitate comparison with the efficacy findings, SAF-3 will also be discussed.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>93</head><p>For these subject pools, the Applicant has defined subject sets for analysis. The first of these is the treated set (TS) which encompasses all subjects who received at least one dose of randomized study medication. Randomized treatment assignment was used to determine treatment group. Assigned treatment could change in Study 1245.38 or at enrollment in the extension study, 1245.24. In the case that subjects were randomized to a different treatment during one of these studies, the treatment grouping would change. This resulted in some subjects being listed under two different treatment groupings. This was only done for the analysis of adverse events. For disposition, demographics, baseline characteristics, and safety laboratory evaluations, only the first assignment was used.</p><p>The second set was the "treated set actual" (TS actual) in which the actual study medication at the time of the adverse event was used for treatment assignment. A subject could thus appear in more than one treatment group for adverse events if there was a change in treatment (either planned or accidental).</p><p>A final group was the open-label set (OLS). In Studies 1245.20, and 1245.23 there was an option for open-label treatment with empagliflozin 25 mg for patients who were ineligible for randomization due to the HbA1c being above 10.0%. This set will not be discussed in this review.</p><p>The primary analysis for safety was based on the TS. Missing safety data were not imputed. The OLS is not included in the "total randomized" or "all randomized" groups.</p></div>

Of these patients, 3,311 of these were treated with empagliflozin 10 mg, 4,563 of these were treated with empagliflozin 25 mg, and 4,697 of these were treated with comparators (placebo, metformin, sitagliptin, or glimepiride).</p><p>Focusing on SAF-5, the total number of patients is provided below ( Exposure to study medication is also provided by the Applicant <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">(Table 51</ref>, <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 52</ref>). The number of patients exposed for SAF-5 is greater than the number of patients presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_30">Table  50</ref> which is based on first randomized treatment assignment because the exposure numbers include those patients with a change in treatment assignment as allowed by protocol for Studies 1245.24 and 1245.38.

There were an additional nine fatal events during screening/run-in, fourteen fatal events in the post-treatment period 1 , and five fatal events in the post-study period 2 . Excluding the screening/run-in deaths, there are a total of 93 events occurring after initiation of randomized study drug.

The percentage of deaths in patients from the Empa 10, Empa 25, and All Empa grouping remained lower than either the placebo group or all comparators group. To protect the integrity of the ongoing cardiovascular safety study <ref type="bibr">(Study 1245.25)</ref>, deaths that occurred in that study will not be discussed in this section but will be discussed in Section 7.3.5.1.1.

The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were from the customized MedDRA query (CMQ) for urinary tract infections. Potential cardiovascular events leading to discontinuation are discussed in Section 7.3.5.1.3. The PT "Weight decreased" was also a more frequent cause for discontinuation in the empagliflozin-treated patients (particularly in the Empa 25 group) vs. comparator-treated patients.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment: POEMS syndrome is characterized by the constellation of polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, and skin changes. Aside from the reported worsening neuropathy, there is no other information provided which would suggest the diagnosis of POEMS.

This meta-analysis included data from completed randomized, double-blind studies with a treatment duration above twelve weeks, and interim data from the ongoing randomized, double-blind studies with preplanned interim analyses <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 81</ref>). This resulted in a total of 10,036 treated patients for analysis. Of the 10,036 treated patients, 6,206 received empagliflozin. Two sets of patients were defined for analysis. The treated set (TS) was defined as the primary analysis set and includes all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The on-treatment set (OS) included all patients who received study drug for at least 30 days (not necessarily consecutively). Analysis included events that occurred up to four weeks after the last dose of study drug.</p><p>Baseline use of aspirin, lipid-lowering agents, and antihypertensive drugs was more common in the empagliflozin-treated patients than in the comparator-treated patients (particularly the active comparator-treated patients) <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 82)</ref>. Similarly, the active comparator group had a lower frequency of relevant medical diagnoses at screening <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 83</ref>). This is likely due to the lack of an active comparator arm in Study 1245.25 which had patients with high risk for MACE and presumably more likely to be on aspirin, lipid-lowering drugs, and antihypertensive drugs, as well as a higher likelihood of having a relevant medical diagnosis. Though it is not explicitly stated in the protocol for Study 1245.25 or in the CV meta-analysis, randomization would presumably result in balance for these baseline factors between the arms in the ongoing CVOT. </p></div>

The evaluation for hepatic injury was performed using the "Liver related investigations, signs and symptoms" SMQ (SMQ code 20000008), "Cholestasis and jaundice of hepatic origin" SMQ (SMQ code 20000009), "Hepatitis, non-infectious" SMQ (SMQ code 20000010), "Hepatic failure, fibrosis and cirrhosis and other liver damage-related conditions" SMQ (SMQ code 20000013), and by review of the laboratory values.</p><p>No imbalance was seen in SAF-5 for reported adverse events of hepatic injury using the CMQ <ref type="table" target="#tab_26">(Table 94</ref>). The PT "Hyperbilirubinaemia" was reported with an increased incidence in the empagliflozin-treated patients compared to the placebo-treated patients. There was an imbalance in the number of patients with laboratory tests showing elevated liver enzymes, with more empagliflozin-treated patients than comparator-treated patients having elevated liver enzymes (eleven patients during treatment with empagliflozin vs. one during treatment with comparator (glimepiride); Cases of suspected DILI underwent independent adjudication by a committee consisting of four experts. Each event of concern was reviewed and voted on by two members. A third member reviewed and voted when another adjudicator was needed. Thirty-six cases that met prespecified criteria were reviewed, and 21 cases were adjudicated as unlikely, eight as possible, one as probable, and six as indeterminate. No irreversible hepatic failure requiring liver transplant was identified. Though five patients met the biochemical criteria for Hy's law, the Applicant and the adjudication committee felt that the alternative explanations could plausibly explain these findings.</p><p>Review of the supplied narratives for these cases is reassuring that the liver laboratory test abnormalities are unlike to be due to empagliflozin treatment. In particular, the alternative explanations offered by the Applicant for the patients with biochemical findings consistent with Hy's law appear plausible. A summary of the empagliflozin patients treated with empagliflozin and with biochemical findings consistent with Hy's law, or with transaminase elevations ≥ 10x ULRR follow:</p></div>

He reported nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite at that time. Testing for hepatitis B and salmonella typhi was negative, and he was clinically diagnosed with hepatitis A. Ultrasound showed no evidence of biliary disease. On day 89, liver tests rose further, and study drug was stopped at that time. One week later (day 96), study drug was restarted. The event was considered resolved on day 166. The patient completed the study, and enrolled in the extension study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment: Though testing for infectious hepatitis was incomplete, this seems to be a plausible explanation as the patient is from a region where infectious hepatitis is endemic.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>187</head><p>Reviewer Comment: While this case is of particular concern as it resulted in liver failure and <ref type="figure">death, it seems unlikely to be a result of treatment with empagliflozin. The long duration of  treatment prior to the event is inconsistent with acute drug-induced liver injury, and the  greater elevation in AST than in ALT is consistent with the Applicant's proposed alternative  etiology of alcohol.</ref> Patient 1245-0033-004003 (Empagliflozin 25 mg): Transaminase ≥ 10x ULRR An 87 year old male with a past medical history of T2DM with neuropathy, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome was found to have elevations in liver enzymes on day 378 since starting study drug. Prior to this finding, he had been diagnosed with pneumonia on day 342 and started on antibiotics on day 344. The antibiotics were stopped on day 362. Evaluation of the liver enzyme elevations was negative for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis E, and Epstein-Barr. Study drug was stopped on day 382. All other medications were stopped on day 384. Ultrasound performed on day 389 showed no pathologic findings, and liver biopsy was consistent with drugrelated hepatitis. Liver enzymes were noted to be normal on day 431. <ref type="figure">: Though the biopsy suggests drug-related hepatitis, there are several  potential culprits. The antibiotics used to treat the pneumonia seem to be the most likely  offender based on the timing. There was a long exposure to study drug before the event, and  the antibiotics were the most recent addition to the patient's medication regimen.</ref> </p></div>

He reportedly had started a new strength training regimen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment: The markedly elevated creatine kinase supports the possibility that the AST and ALT elevations originated from muscle injury.

There was a small numerical imbalance in the percentage of patients being treated with empagliflozin who had ALT ≥ 3x ULRR with T. Bili ≥ 2x ULRR and Alk Phos &lt; 2x ULRR. While these small imbalances are suggestive, there is no convincing evidence of an increased likelihood of drug-induced liver injury with empagliflozin treatment.

Work-up for abnormal liver laboratory tests were negative for Epstein-Barr infection, viral hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and cholecystolithiasis (by ultrasound). No elevation in bilirubin was ever documented. Despite the absence of a typical drug-induced liver injury pattern, the event was reported as a drug-induced hepatic disorder due to improvement in liver laboratory tests with discontinuation of empagliflozin.

The most frequent PT was "Traumatic fracture". Review of the available narratives does not indicate that any of these events were clearly the result of hypotension, syncope, or hypoglycemia. While a few PTs were seen with a slightly greater incidence in the empagliflozin-treated patient vs. comparator, no clear imbalance in fractures was seen. Grouping fractures into upper extremity and lower extremity fractures also did not demonstrate an increased risk for either grouping with empagliflozin treatment.

Individual terms seen with a higher incidence in the empagliflozin-treated patients include "Syncope", "Orthostatic hypotension", and "Dehydration". While renal failure can be seen as a result of volume depletion, PTs related to renal failure are not included in this CMQ. They are discussed separately in 7.3.5.6. The use of diuretic medications at baseline resulted in an increase in volume depletion events for both empagliflozin and placebo <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">(Table 101</ref>). The incidence in the empagliflozin-treated patients was slightly higher than in placebo-treated patients. When added to loop diuretics, there was a more noticeable increased incidence of these events with empagliflozin treatment compared to placebo. </p></div>

Dehydration due to significant glucosuria was considered to be the cause for these events, though concomitant treatment with hydrocodone and methylprednisolone for neck pain may have contributed as well. The second case occurred in a patient (1245-0049-076554) being treated with empagliflozin 10 mg. On day 84 of treatment, collapse with loss of consciousness occurred. The last dose of study drug was the same day. Prior to this event, the patient had reported a 10 kg weight loss which was attributed to study drug. The investigator assessed the initial event as probably related to the weight loss. After lying on the floor for three days (reason not provided), the patient was found by neighbors and taken to the hospital by ambulance.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>210</head><p>It is noted that nine patients had the reported event of "Epidermal growth factor receptor decreased" <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 107</ref>). Measurement of epidermal growth factor receptor was not part of any of the study protocols, and I have difficulty determining a reason why this would be measured for any of these patients. I suspect that this PT was miscoded, and should have been coded as "Glomerular filtration rate decreased", which is part of the "Acute renal failure" SMQ. Incorporating these patients into the numbers reported above does not significantly change the above findings <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 108</ref>).</p><p>Based on the serum creatinine criteria defined by the Applicant, there was no increased incidence of empagliflozin-treated patients developing decreased renal function <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">(Table 109</ref>).</p><p>Certain subgroups appeared to be at greater risk for decreased renal function events. Older patients (i.e. ≥ 75 years of age) appeared to develop decreased renal function more frequently than with placebo, particularly with the 25 mg dose <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">(Table 110)</ref>. Female patients and Hispanic/Latino patients also appeared to more frequently develop decreased renal function, though there is no plausible explanation for this observation. Subjects with lower baseline eGFR by MDRD also appeared to have slightly increased risk for developing decreased renal function. None of these differences was statistically significant. The small numbers of patients with more severe renal impairment, particularly at the 10 mg dose, limit the ability to make more definitive statements regarding the role of baseline eGFR in identifying patients at risk for developing decreased renal function with empagliflozin treatment.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>215</head><p>In addition to examining serum creatinine, changes in eGFR as calculated by the MDRD equation were analyzed. Decreases in eGFR were greater with empagliflozin treatment, both numerically and by percent change <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">(Table 111</ref>). The change in eGFR to from baseline to the last value on treatment (LVOT) was greater with the 25 mg dose than with the 10 mg dose, which in turn had a greater change than placebo. This suggests that the changes in eGFR are dependent on dose. Recovery from these changes was examined by analysis of follow-up data from Studies 1245. <ref type="bibr">33, 1245.36, and 1245.48</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 112, Table 113</ref>,and <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 114</ref>). As was seen with the overall safety grouping SAF-5, there was a greater decrease in eGFR from baseline to LVOT with 25 mg than with 10 mg, which in turn had a greater decrease than with placebo (numerically and by percent change).

This change appears to be reversible with discontinuation of empagliflozin therapy. While a decrease in renal function in a population already at risk for renal dysfunction is clinically concerning, this apparent reversibility is reassuring that there is no direct renal toxicity from empagliflozin. Examination of subgroups suggests that there is a numerically increased incidence of renal failure adverse events for patients with age ≥ 75 years old (incidence increases from 1.26% from the overall safety population to 2.21%) and for eGFR from 30 to &lt; 60 with the 25 mg dose (incidence increases from 1.26% from the overall safety population to 4.44%). Given this finding, caution should be exercised in using the 25 mg dose in these subgroups.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.5.6.1">Decreased Renal Function -Four Month Safety Update</head><p>In the 4-month safety update, two cases concerning for decreased renal function are included in the SUSARs.</p><p>The first case was in a patient (1245-0025-) being treated with empagliflozin 25 mg. Gradual decline in eGFR was noted following initiation of treatment with empagliflozin. At screening, eGFR was 59 ml/min/1.73 m 2 . Twenty-nine days after initiating study drug, eGFR was noted to be 48 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and an event of renal insufficiency was reported. Three hundred thirty-two days after randomization, the patient was hospitalized with urinary tract NDA-204629 Jardiance (empagliflozin) Primary Clinical Review William H. Chong 220 infection and worsening renal insufficiency. The calculated eGFR at that time was 31 ml/min/1.73 m 2 . Study drug was stopped at that time. After treatment of the urinary tract infection, laboratory tests showed the eGFR to be 47 ml/min/1.73 m 2 , and empagliflozin therapy was restarted on day 349. On day 365, eGFR was 50 ml/min/1.73 m 2 .</p><p>The second case was in a patient (1245-0025 ) being treated with empagliflozin 25 mg. Five hundred sixty days after randomization, a 2.2x increase from baseline creatinine was reported. No treatment was reported, and renal function remained stable at this level. The event was reported as recovered with sequelae (i.e. new diagnosis of chronic renal insufficiency). Obstructive nephrolithiasis was reported on day 632. Study drug was stopped that same day. With the obstructive nephrolithiasis, acute decrease in renal function was seen as well as development of sepsis from urinary tract infection. Both of these resolved following treatment with antibiotics, decompression, and intravenous (IV) fluids.</p><p>From review of the adverse event listing for the studies that support the NDA <ref type="table">(Table C.</ref>1.2: 1 in the 4MSU), there are an additional ten events (0.09%) that could be considered decreased renal function events. The incidence from these studies does not exceed that seen with placebo for SAF-5. Treatment remains blinded. No additional safety concerns are raised by this additional information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.5.7">Hypoglycemic Events</head><p>Hypoglycemic events were assessed based on information recorded in the case report forms. Events did not need to be coded to the PT "Hypoglycemia" to be considered a hypoglycemic event, and investigators were instructed to record additional information on events considered to be a hypoglycemic event. Additional information collected for hypoglycemic events included the plasma glucose, symptoms, and whether external assistance was needed.</p><p>A confirmed hypoglycemic event was defined by the Applicant as an event with typical hypoglycemic symptoms and an associated plasma glucose ≤ 70 mg/dL, or requiring assistance of another person. An asymptomatic hypoglycemic event was defined by the Applicant as plasma glucose between 54 mg/dL and 70 mg/dL without symptoms of hypoglycemia, and was recorded separately from the adverse events. Comparing the incidence of hypoglycemic events in SAF-5 did not demonstrate an imbalance between the empagliflozin-treated patients and the comparator-treated patients for number of events, number of severe events, minimum glucose value, time to first episode, or number of events per patient <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">(Table 115</ref>). The Applicant has categorized hypoglycemic events by the number of episodes per patient, intensity of the worst episode, plasma glucose range (i.e. &lt; 70 mg/dL or &lt; 54 mg/dL), presence or absence of symptoms, time of onset, and whether the event led to premature discontinuation. Hypoglycemic events were also analyzed by age categories, gender, race, ethnicity, and baseline renal function, and there was no apparent increase in the incidence of hypoglycemic events with empagliflozin treatment compared to placebo when considering these factors <ref type="bibr">(not shown,</ref><ref type="bibr">see Tables 5.14.5.5,</ref><ref type="bibr">5.14.5.6,</ref><ref type="bibr">5.14.5.7,</ref><ref type="bibr">5.14.5.8,</ref><ref type="bibr">5.14.5.9,</ref><ref type="bibr">5.14.5.10,</ref><ref type="bibr">5.14.5.11,</ref><ref type="bibr">5.14.5.12,</ref><ref type="bibr">5.14.5.17,</ref><ref type="bibr">and 5.14.5.18</ref> of the Integrated Summary of Safety).</p><p>For the safety grouping SAF-3, the incidence of hypoglycemic events was slightly higher with empagliflozin than with placebo <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">(Table 116</ref>). There were no severe hypoglycemic events in any treatment arm. The majority of events were mild in intensity, and none required hospitalization.  Given that concomitant use of other antidiabetic medications would be predicted to impact the incidence of hypoglycemia, the Applicant has also evaluated hypoglycemic events by baseline background antidiabetic medication <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 117</ref>). The incidence of hypoglycemic events increased when the background therapy included sulfonylureas or insulin, and the addition of empagliflozin appeared to increase the frequency of hypoglycemic events when added to metformin + sulfonylurea background vs. placebo. As there was no evidence of an increased incidence in the patients treated with metformin only, one can infer that it is the addition of empagliflozin to a sulfonylurea that results in the increased risk for hypoglycemia. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.5.7.1">Hypoglycemic Events -Four Month Safety Update</head><p>No additional information on hypoglycemic events is reported in the 4-month safety update.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.5.8">Malignancy Events</head><p>The Applicant explored malignancy events using a CMQ which included the "Malignant and unspecified tumors" SMQ (SMQ code 20000091) and the "Malignancy related conditions" SMQ (SMQ code 20000092), excluding the PT "Acanthosis nigricans". Malignancy events were analyzed for all malignancy events, and for events occurring after six months for patients treated for greater than six months. Given that malignancies typically have a long latency period for development, examining the malignancy events occurring after six months of treatment in patients treated for greater than six months may give a more accurate perspective of the risk for malignancy events associated with empagliflozin use. A slight increase in the overall incidence of all malignancy events and in the incidence of malignancy events occurring after six months of treatment was noted <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 118</ref>). For the safety grouping SAF-3, there was only a small number of malignancy events occurring after six months of treatment (0.2% for Empa 10; 0.6% for Empa 25; 0.2% for placebo; 0.4% for sitagliptin) with no single Preferred Term was reported more than once. The focus of this section will be on SAF-5 where the larger number of patients and events allows for a more credible comparison. While there was only a slight difference in the overall incidence of malignancy events between groups, there were notable imbalances for specific types of malignancies. Using MedDRA High Level Terms (HLTs), there were more events in the "Skin melanomas (excl ocular)" and "Respiratory tract and pleural neoplasm malignant cell type unspecified NEC" HLT for the empagliflozin-treated patients compared to the comparator-treated patients (six vs. zero for "Skin melanomas (excl ocular)", five vs. zero for "Respiratory tract and pleural neoplasm malignancy cell type unspecified NEC") <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">(Table 119</ref>).</p><p>Other HLTs for which there were no cases in the all comparator group were "Bile duct neoplasm malignant", "Oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal and tonsillar neoplasms malignant and unspecified", "Bladder neoplasms malignant", and "Thyroid neoplasm malignant". For each of these terms, there were only two cases in the All Empa group compared to none in the all comparator group, making it more difficult to exclude chance as a cause for the imbalance. There is no clear mechanistic explanation for the observed imbalance in lung neoplasms or melanomas. The Applicant suggests that the increased incidence of these malignancy events is due to factors other than exposure to empagliflozin. Further discussion of the lung neoplasm and melanoma cases follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lung neoplasms:</head><p>Review of the submitted AE.xpt files identifies two additional cases in which there was an onset of a lung cancer adverse event after six months from randomization that were not included in the Applicant's summary. The first case (patient 1245-0033-004331) appears to have been excluded as the defined TS and treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) period was for up to seven days after last dose of study medication. Additionally, the patient was not exposed to study drug for greater than six months, which the Applicant used as a criteria for identifying cases. This patient had discontinuation at day 167 (just shy of six months), and the lung cancer event occurred at day 193. The second case (patient 1245-0023-034564) fell into a separate HLT ("Non-small cell neoplasms malignant of the respiratory tract cell type specified"). Inclusion of these cases brings the total number of cases to seven. Reviewing the supplied narratives for these cases provides some additional information. One patient (patient 1245-0038-809006) appears to be misclassified. Though coded as a case of metastatic lung cancer, review of the narrative reveals that it to be a case of colon cancer with metastases to the lung. Another patient (Patient 1245-0023-034564) had a baseline history of squamous cell lung cancer treated with surgical resection five years before randomization to empagliflozin. The adverse event was a recurrence of prior disease 371 days after randomization.</p><p>From review of the supplied narratives and from additional information provided by the Applicant on August 16, 2013 in response to a request for information, all of the patients (excluding Patient 1245-0038-006859) had baseline risk factors for the development of lung cancer ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 121</ref>). All of the patients were either current or prior smokers. One case (Patient 1245-0023-034564) had a prior history of lung cancer. One case (Patient 1245-0020-020704) had a history of asbestos exposure and a family history of lung cancer. Additionally, there was no consistent single cellular type across all of these patients. This also speaks against the lung cancers being a result of empagliflozin treatment.  <ref type="bibr">-204629, SD-18, eCTD-0016)</ref> Assuming that this additional history provides an alternative explanation that is sufficient to exclude empagliflozin as the causative factor, there remain no patients in the empagliflozintreated arms resulting in no imbalance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Melanomas:</head><p>For melanoma, there were six patients with events occurring greater than six months after randomization <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 122</ref>). From review of the supplied narratives and from additional information provided by the Applicant on August 16, 2013 in response to a request for information, the majority of these patients had baseline risk factors for the development of melanoma <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 123)</ref>.  <ref type="bibr">(NDA-204629, SD-18, eCTD-0016)</ref> Assuming that this additional history provides an alternative explanation that is sufficient to exclude empagliflozin as the causative factor, there remain two patients in the empagliflozintreated arms compared to zero in the comparator-treated arms. From these amended numbers it is difficult to conclude that empagliflozin treatment resulted in the development of melanoma. Additionally, there are no data (either clinical or preclinical) to suggest that there is increased phototoxicity associated with empagliflozin use. As discussed above for lung neoplasm, the small number of events taken in conjunction with a lack of plausible mechanism does not support a causative role for empagliflozin in the development of melanomas.</p><p>The Office of Hematology and Oncology Products were consulted regarding the imbalance in lung cancers and melanomas. In the consult response by Dr. Jennie Chang, she notes that the cases of lung cancer occurred in high-risk individuals. The incidence of 150 cases per 100,000 patient-years is higher than the 61.4 cases per 100,000 patient-years in the general population but less than the 600 cases per 100,000 patient-years expected in a high-risk population. For melanoma, Dr. Chang again notes that the cases of melanoma occurred in high-risk individuals. The incidence of 120 cases per 100,000 patient-years is higher than the 21.1 cases per 100,000 patient-years for the general population. The incidence in high-risk individuals is not known. She concludes that that it is unclear whether these events are truly associated with empagliflozin and makes recommendations regarding additional postmarketing surveillance and nonclinical studies ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 24</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>.8.1 Malignancies -Four Month Safety Update</head><p>In the 4-month safety update, additional cases of malignancy events are reported. Two additional case of lung cancer are reported, and two additional cases of melanoma are reported. Treatment remains blinded for these patients, but the small number of additional cases for these malignancies does not raise any additional safety concerns.</p><p>Other malignancies reported in more than two patients from this update include prostate cancer (n=10; 0.09%), renal carcinoma (n=7; 0.06%), basal cell carcinoma (n=6; 0.05%), bladder cancer (n=4; 0.04%), and breast cancer (n=3; 0.03%) 1 . Treatment remains blinded for these cases. The overall incidence for each of these is low and not markedly different from the reported incidence for placebo in SAF-5 (0.09% for prostate "Prostatic neoplasms malignant" HLT; "0.06% for "Renal neoplasms malignant" HLT; 0.06% for "Basal cell carcinoma" PT; 0.00% for "Bladder neoplasms malignant" HLT; 0.03% for "Breast and nipple neoplasms malignant" HLT) 2 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>232</head><p>For SAF-3, the SOCs of "Skin and subcutaneous disorders", "Renal and urinary disorders", "Gastrointestinal disorders", "Nervous system disorders", Reproductive system and breast disorders", and "Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders" were reported more frequently in the empagliflozin-treated patients than in the placebo-treated patients <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 127)</ref>. Preferred Terms reported with a greater frequency in the empagliflozin-treated patients were "Hypoglycaemia", "Pollakiuria", "Toothache", "Muscle spasms", "Hypercholesterolaemia", Vulvovaginal pruritus", "Thirst", "Hypertriglyceridaemia", "Paraesthesia", "Polyuria", and "Weight decreased".</p><p>Given the mechanism of action for empagliflozin, the increased frequency of some of these terms (e.g. "Thirst", "Polyuria", "Pollakiuria", "Hypoglycemia") in the empagliflozin patients could be plausibly attributed to empagliflozin treatment.    Excluding those patients at high risk for CV events (i.e. the patients in Study 1245.25) from SAF-5 yielded results similar to what was seen with the entire SAF-5 population. The SOCs "Renal and urinary disorder", and "Reproductive system and breast disorder" were reported with greater frequency in the empagliflozin-treated patients (either 10 mg or 25 mg dose) than in the comparator-treated patients <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 128</ref>). In addition to these SOCs, the SOC "Infections and infestations" was reported with greater frequency in the empagliflozin-treated patients than in comparator-treated patients. The PTs "Thirst", "Pollakiuria", "Polyuria", and "Vulvovaginal pruritus" were again reported with greater frequency in the empagliflozin-treated patients than in the comparator-treated patients <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 128</ref>). In the SOC "Infections and infestations", the increased incidence of this SOC in the empagliflozin-treated patients appears to be a results of several PTs, all relating to upper airway infections (i.e. "Nasopharyngitis", "Sinusitis", and "Pharyngitis").</p><p>For the completed studies in SAF-5, the findings are again similar to the entire SAF-5 grouping.</p><p>The events in the SOCs of "Infections and infestations", "Renal and urinary disorders" SOC, and "Reproductive system and breast disorder" were reported with a higher incidence in the empagliflozin-treated patients (either 10 mg or 25 mg dose) compared to the comparator-treated patients <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 129</ref>). The increased incidence in the "Infections and infestations" SOC again appears to be due to upper airway infections (PTs "Nasopharyngitis", "Sinusitis", and "Pharyngitis"). The PT "Vulvovaginal pruritus" is not reported by ≥ 1% of empagliflozintreated patients, but the other terms ("Thirst", "Pollakiuria", and "Polyuria") are again noted to be reported with a greater frequency in the empagliflozin-treated patients.  In the proposed label, the Applicant presents the adverse reaction/clinical studies experience based on the pivotal studies <ref type="bibr">(1245.19, 1245.20, 1245</ref>.23 met , and 1245.23 met+SU ) at 24 weeks and the add-on to basal insulin study (1245.33) at 18 weeks rather than from the larger safety grouping SAF-5. While this grouping is smaller and covers a shorter exposure than SAF-5, the findings are consistent with that observed for the larger safety grouping. Looking at the aggregate of the treatment-emergent adverse events for this group of studies, the increased frequency of events in the "Renal and urinary disorder" and "Reproductive system and breast disorder" SOC with empagliflozin treatment is again apparent <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">(Table 130</ref>). Individual PTs where there is an increase in frequency with empagliflozin treatment are "Pollakiuria", "Polyuria", "Thirst", "Vulvovaginal pruritus", "Hypoglycaemia", "Urinary tract infection", and "Dry mouth". Laboratory test data were analyzed based on the first treatment assignment. A "treated set" (TS) was defined as all patients with at least one dose of randomized study medication. A "treated set actual" was used for analysis of adverse events assessed as drug-related with the actual study medication taken at the time of the adverse event defining the treatment assignment.</p><p>Several differences in laboratory findings were noted in the empagliflozin development program and will be discussed further.</p></div>

Additional endpoints were time to first MI (fatal and nonfatal) and first stroke (fatal and nonfatal).All events were adjudicated by an independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC) composed of five cardiologists and five neurologists. The committee reviewed all reported fatal events, and any events suspected to be a stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial ischemia, hospitalization for unstable angina or heart failure, or stent thrombosis and revascularization procedure. Two members reviewed and voted on each case with a third member reviewing and voting on cases if there was disagreement.The main analysis included all CV events that occurred during the planned observational period and included events with an onset after study drug discontinuation. Events prior to the first intake of study drug were not included. Hazard ratios were based on Cox regression model for time to first event with treatment and study as stratification factors. Additional analyses were performed as sensitivity analyses (e.g. risk ratio based on Poisson regression model, odds-ratio based on exact test for a 2x2 contingency table, risk ratio based on Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, and time to event using Kaplan-Meier estimates).</figDesc><table><row><cell>Completed Studies</cell><cell>Description</cell></row><row><cell>1245.19</cell><cell>Efficacy and safety as add-on to pioglitazone +/-metformin compared to placebo</cell></row><row><cell>1245.20</cell><cell>Efficacy and safety as monotherapy compared to placebo and compared to sitagliptin</cell></row><row><cell>1245.23</cell><cell>Efficacy and safety as add-on to metformin and as add-on to metformin+sulfonylurea</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>compared to placebo</cell></row><row><cell>1245.36</cell><cell>Efficacy and safety as add-on to any background therapy compared to placebo in patients</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>with renal impairment</cell></row><row><cell>1245.33</cell><cell>Efficacy and safety as add-on to basal insulin with or without concomitant metformin +/-</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>sulfonylurea compared to placebo</cell></row><row><cell>Studies with interim data</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>1245.25</cell><cell>CV safety compared to placebo in patients with T2DM and increased CV risk</cell></row><row><cell>-cut-off date: June 22, 2012</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>1245.28</cell><cell>Efficacy and safety as add-on to metformin compared to glimepiride</cell></row><row><cell>-cut-off date: July 31, 2012</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>1245.31</cell><cell>Extension of Studies 1245.19, 1245.20, and 1245.23</cell></row><row><cell>-cut-off date: May 29, 2012</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="2">CV = cardiovascular; T2DM = type 2 diabetes mellitus</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Source: Tables 6.2.1: 1 and 6.2.1: 2 (Interim cardiovascular safety meta-analysis)</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

Diagnosis was made based on ECG changes, and she was hospitalized for the event. Further information is not available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment: This is an early CV event.</head><p>Patient 1245-0009-009883 (empagliflozin 5 mg): Myocardial infarction A 68 year old male with past medical history of hypertension experienced an event of acute myocardial infarction on day 43 of study drug treatment. He presented to the emergency room with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. He was hospitalized and angioplasty was performed. He was discharged on day 48, but was readmitted on day 50 with similar symptoms. Work-up at that time did not identify another myocardial infarction. Last dose of study medication was day 42.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment: This is an early CV event.</head><p>Patient 1245-0010-005811 (empagliflozin 25 mg): Coronary artery disease A 70 year old male with past medical history of hypertension and coronary artery disease (for approximately twelve years) experienced worsening of coronary artery disease on day nine. Exertional pain was reported leading to the diagnosis. On day 52 he was hospitalized for cardiac catheterization with stent placement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment: This is an early CV event.</head><p>Patient 1245-0010-006063 (empagliflozin 5 mg): MI A 68 year old male with past medical history of dyslipidemia and hypertension experienced the event of myocardial infarction on day 81 of study treatment.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: This is an early CV event. <ref type="bibr">Reference</ref>  A 66 year old female experienced an event of possible TIA 61 days after starting study treatment. Study treatment had been completed on day 28 (as planned per protocol). Decreased hematocrit had been noted at end-of-study visit. At follow-up on day 61, this had returned to baseline. On the way home, she experienced loss of consciousness with fall. No hypoglycemia was reported. Neurology work-up included cerebrovascular angiography showing arteriosclerotic change but no stenosis. She was started on daily aspirin therapy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment: Though this is an early cerebrovascular event, given the occurrence of the event &gt; 30 days after last dose of study drug this event is unlikely to be related to study treatment.</head><p>Patient 1245-0019-010820 (empagliflozin 25 mg): Myocardial ischemia A 48 year old female with past medical history of gastritis and intermittent atypical chest pain experienced an event of myocardial ischemia on day three of study treatment. She reported chest pains similar to what she previously experienced. Stress test was concerning for myocardial ischemia. Additional testing did not identify any cardiac disease (normal angiography, normal echocardiogram). Angiography was complicated by hematoma and infection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment: This does not appear to be a case of myocardial ischemia/CV disease as angiography did not show coronary artery disease.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient 1245-0019-010941 (empagliflozin 25 mg): Cerebral infarct</head><p>A 58 year old female with past medical history of hypertension experienced a cerebral infarct on day 27 of study treatment. She developed slurred speech, and facial droop. She was brought to the hospital. MRI showed acute infarct of the left pons with focal stenosis of the basilar artery.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment: This is an early stroke event.</head><p>Patient 1245-0020-020064 (empagliflozin 10 mg): Stroke A 61 year old male with a past medical history of stroke, hypertension, and dyslipidemia experienced an event of stroke on day 165 of study treatment. He presented with aphasia, hemianopsia, and nystagmus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a recent infarct. Patient 1245-0023-032200 (empagliflozin 10 mg): Lacunar infarction A 52 year old female with past medical history of hypertension and dyslipidemia experienced a lacunar infarct on day 50 of study treatment. She reported dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. Detailed information is not available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment: This is an early stroke event.</head><p>Patient 1245-0024-004135 (empagliflozin 100 mg): Ischemic stroke A 68 year old male with past medical history of hypertension and metabolic syndrome experienced an ischemic stroke on day 177. He experienced aphasia and right-sided paralysis. No action was taken with regard to the study medication. He had initially been on blinded therapy with empagliflozin 100 mg, but at the time of the events was on open-label therapy (unknown dose).</p></div>

He had reported loss of consciousness leading to hospitalization. An MRI was performed and reported as normal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment: This is concerning for an early cerebrovascular event.</head></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment: Included in this narrative is discussion of an episode of dizziness requiring hospitalization on day 368. This led to diagnosis of cerebral infarction. This event does not appear to have been reported.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4.2.4">Serum Uric Acid</head><p>Serum uric acid values decreased from baseline in all empagliflozin-treated groups. This may indicate uricosuria due to treatment with empagliflozin, signaling a potential for causing renal insufficiency/impairment <ref type="table">(Table 142</ref>). Though the percentage of patients shifting from WRR to below LLRR was only slightly higher in the empagliflozin-treated patients, there was a more marked difference in the percentage of patients with serum uric acid above ULRR at baseline that shifted to WRR <ref type="table">(Table 143</ref>). These findings are supportive of each other, but the clinical significance of these changes is unclear. Notably, a propensity for empagliflozin-treated patients to develop decreases in eGFR was seen. These changes in eGFR were reversible with discontinuation of empagliflozin treatment. See 7.3.5.6 for discussion of renal insufficiency/impairment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment on Dose Dependency for Safety:</head><p>There is a plausible mechanism for some of the observed differences with the 10 mg vs. the 25 mg dose. This leads me to believe that some of these findings of dose dependency are real. As such, availability of the 10 mg dose is desirable, particularly for older patients and for patients with moderate renal impairment. Tolerability may also be improved with the lower dose, as some adverse events that could affect tolerability and compliance (e.g. dry mouth) were more frequent with the higher dose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.5.2">Time Dependency for Adverse Events</head><p>Discussion of time dependency for CV events can be found in 7.3.5.1. Examination of the adverse events of special interest at 30 days, 60 days, 120 days, and 180 days after initiation of therapy for SAF-5 demonstrated findings similar to the overall findings for adverse events for SAF-5 <ref type="table">(Table 148</ref>). At all of these time points, urinary tract infections occurred slightly more frequently in the empagliflozin-treated patients than in placebo, and genital infections were more frequent in the empagliflozin-treated patients than in placebo. While in the overall safety population there was no increased incidence of decreased renal function with empagliflozin treatment (either by adverse event reports or serum creatinine changes), an imbalance not favoring empagliflozin is seen at each of these time points. This suggests that there are early changes in renal function with empagliflozin therapy that converge with placebo over time (see 0).  <ref type="bibr">5.5,</ref><ref type="bibr">5.10.5.5,</ref><ref type="bibr">5.11.5.5,</ref><ref type="bibr">5.12.5.6,</ref><ref type="bibr">5.13.5.6,</ref><ref type="bibr">5.14.5.12,</ref><ref type="bibr">5.15.5.5,</ref><ref type="bibr">and 5.16.5.5 (Integrated Summary of Safety)</ref>  <ref type="figure">Black patients made up a small percentage of the patients in empagliflozin development  program. This raises question about the generalizability of the findings (both safety and  efficacy)</ref> from the overall development program for this racial group. Additional study in this racial group may be warranted. In addition to the overall evaluation of safety across studies in the development program, Study 1245.36 was a phase 3 study designed to examine the safety and efficacy of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and renal impairment. Subjects were stratified by renal function as above, and were treated with empagliflozin as add-on to baseline therapy. The 10 mg dose of empagliflozin was studied only in mild renal impairment, while the 25 mg dose was studied in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment on Safety by Race/Ethnicity:</head><p>In terms of incidence of any adverse events, there was similarity between all treatment groups in this study for patients with mild renal impairment <ref type="table">(Table 155</ref>). Serious adverse events were more frequent with placebo than with empagliflozin, though the 25 mg dose resulted in a higher percentage of patients reporting an SAE compared to the 10 mg dose. Nothing can be said about the 10 mg dose in moderate or severe renal impairment.</p><p>Please refer to 7.3.5.7.1. There was a small imbalance in lung cancers and melanomas between the empagliflozin-treated patients and the comparator-treated patients. The absence of a plausible mechanism and the small number of cases without known risk factors limits the confidence with which conclusions can be made, but there is no convincing evidence of carcinogenicity with empagliflozin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.6.2">Human Reproduction and Pregnancy Data</head><p>Based on the nonclinical data, empagliflozin is not expected to impact fertility, implantation, or fetal development. Inhibition of rat pup weight gain was observed when doses ≥ 10 mg/kg/day of empagliflozin were administered to the mothers. This was reversible, and suspected to be due to exposure through milk.</p><p>No randomized data on use in pregnant or nursing women were collected as they were excluded from any study in the development program. Women of child-bearing potential had pregnancy testing and were counseled to use an acceptable form of contraception. Nevertheless, 8 patients became pregnant while being treated with study medication. Study medication was stopped in all cases, and the patients were followed to birth or termination. Four of the 8 patients were taking empagliflozin at the time of discovery of the pregnancy.</p><p>NDA-204629 Jardiance (empagliflozin) Primary Clinical Review William H.

Addition of the 10 mg dosage with the recommended starting dose being 10 mg once daily. The label will need to be modified throughout to include data for the 10 mg dose. 2. Dosage can be increased to 25 mg 3. Cautious use in elderly patients and in patients with moderate renal impairment. The 25 mg dose not recommended in these patients. 4. Addition of language discussing increased risk of volume depletion when used concomitantly with other diuretics, particularly loop diuretics 5. Removal of data 6. Removal of data patients 7. Removal of 8. Removal of 9. Edits to language to harmonize the label with the canagliflozin label Detailed labeling recommendations will be discussed in dedicated labeling meetings.  <ref type="figure">-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</ref>--This is a representation of an electronic record that was signed electronically and this page is the manifestation of the electronic signature. <ref type="figure">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</ref>  <ref type="figure">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</ref> </p></div>			</div>
