<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Executive Summary Product Introduction</head><p>On March 31, 2016, Advanced Accelerator Applications, S.A. (AAA) submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) under 505(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Lutathera (lutetium Lu 177 dotatate) solution for intravenous use, a new molecular entity and radiolabeled somatostatin analogue (SSA) contained in a 30 mL single-use glass vial. A complete response (CR) letter was issued to AAA on <ref type="bibr">December 19, 2016</ref>, listing deficiencies with the data submitted to support the application, and deficiencies in manufacturing sites identified during inspection. The current Type 2 NDA re-submission was received on July 26, 2017. The resubmission reasonably responds to all issues indicated in the CR letter, and correction of all inspection findings have been made with no recommendation for re-inspection deemed necessary. The drug formulation has a concentration of 370 MBq/mL, and is intended to be administered at a cumulative dose of 29.6 GBq divided into four separate administrations eight weeks apart. The proposed indication is treatment of somatostatin receptor positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) including foregut, midgut, and hindgut neuroendocrine tumors in adults.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions on the Substantial Evidence of Effectiveness</head><p>The recommendations for approval of Lutathera for the treatment of somatostatin receptor positive GEP-NETs including foregut, midgut, and hindgut neuroendocrine tumors in adults under 21 CFR 314 Subpart D are based on the results of two clinical trials. The trial providing primary support was an international, open-label trial of 229 patients in which statistically significant, robust, and clinically meaningful improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) were demonstrated for patients with histologically confirmed, advanced/inoperable or metastatic, somatostatin receptor (SSTR) positive midgut GEP-NETs that had progressed while on octreotide LAR who were treated with Lutathera. Support for the indication for the treatment of patients with GEP-NETs other than those arising in the midgut comes from a subset analysis of 360 patients in an investigator sponsored, open-label, single-arm, singleinstitution study of 1214 patients with SSTR positive neuroendocrine (NEC) tumors for whom improvement in overall response rates and response durations were both clinically meaningful and consistent with those for midgut NETs. In addition, the biology of this disease and the mechanism of action for Lutathera provide increased confidence that the benefits in PFS, overall response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DoR) observed in the clinical trials are accurate. This population of patients represents an unmet medical need, as available treatment options offer few true benefits. Lutathera has demonstrated consistent, statistically significant, and clinically meaningful improvements in PFS, ORRs, and DoRs for patients with GEP-NETs, and has met its burden of proof for demonstrating both safety and effectiveness under the prevailing statutory and regulatory standards.</p><p>Reference ID: 4211167 <ref type="bibr">(4)</ref> NDA/BLA Multidisciplinary Review and Evaluation NDA 207800 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate (Lutathera) <ref type="bibr">13</ref> Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(b) (4) (b)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit-Risk Assessment</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit-Risk Summary and Assessment</head><p>The effectiveness of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate for adult patients with GEP-NETs is supported by data from two international, open-label trials demonstrating consistent, statistically significant, and clinically meaningful improvements in progression free survival and overall response rates for patients with GEP-NETs who were treated with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate. Health related Quality of Life (QoL) was assessed using the EOTC QLQ-30 and QLQ G.I.NET21 questionnaires in the NETTER-1 trial submitted in support of the application. The data were incomplete and flawed, preventing any inferences being drawn from the analyses of these data; therefore, the data were not considered in decision making during review of the application. NETTER-1 enrolled 229 patients with histologically confirmed, advanced/inoperable or metastatic, SSTR positive midgut carcinoid tumors that had progressed while on octreotide LAR. Patients in NETTER-1 were randomized to lutetium Lu 177 dotatate (n=116) or octreotide LAR (113). Patients received either lutetium Lu 177 dotatate <ref type="bibr">(7.4</ref> GBq [200 mCi] every 8 weeks for up to 4 administrations; maximum cumulative dose of 29.6 GBq) with octreotide LAR (30 mg by intramuscular injection every 4 weeks) or octreotide LAR monotherapy (60 mg by intramuscular injection every 4 weeks). Randomization was stratified by OctreoScan tumor uptake score (Grade 2, 3 or 4) and the length of time that patients had been on the most recent constant dose of octreotide prior to randomization (≤ 6 or &gt; 6 months). The primary endpoint was PFS based on an independent review assessment (IRC); and the trial was designed with 90% power at a 2-sided alpha level of 5%. ORR and overall survival (OS) were major secondary endpoint measurements that were tested in hierarchical order to adjust for multiplicity.</p><p>The statistical reviewer identified several flaws inherent in the NETTER-1 trial design. The trial used coin toss randomization for the first 28 patients and permuted block randomization for the remainder; the applicant's PFS and OS derivation used an imputed date, which does not provide a reliable estimate; there was an asymmetric delay in the first dose in the lutetium Lu 177 dotatate arm resulting in asymmetric time to tumor assessment from randomization; and the statistical analysis plan PFS analysis was intended to be performed when 74 PFS evaluable events were observed, with the same efficacy cut-off date, the application resubmission contained 91 PFS events, and FDA's analysis was based on 105 PFS events.</p><p>A statistically significant and clinically meaningful treatment effect on PFS was observed for patients treated with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate Reference ID: 4211167 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) compared to those treated with octreotide LAR. The estimated median PFS was not reached for patients in the lutetium Lu 177 dotatate arm compared to 8.5 months (95% CI: 5. <ref type="bibr">8, 9.1)</ref> in the octreotide LAR arm; the un-stratified HR was 0.21 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.32); p-value &lt;0.0001. Patients who received lutetium Lu 177 dotatate exhibited a statistically significant improvement in ORR as assessed by IRC compared to those treated with octreotide LAR. The ORR was 12.9% (95% CI: 7%, 19%) and 3.5% (95% CI: 0.1%, 7%) for lutetium Lu 177 dotatate and octreotide LAR, respectively, and the Fisher's exact test p-value is 0.0148. The estimated median OS for an updated analysis requested by FDA was not reached in the lutetium Lu 177 dotatate arm and 27.4 months (95% CI: 22.2, not evaluable) in the octreotide LAR arm, with a stratified HR of 0.52 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.84), and p-value of 0.0068.</p><p>The PFS analysis results for NETTER-1 with a HR=0.21 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.32); p-value &lt;0.0001, together with the ORR of 12.9 in the lutetium Lu 177 dotatate arm and 3.5% in the octreotide arm, and a Fisher's exact p-value of 0.0068 represent statistically significant improvements for patients treated with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate and are consistent with the protocol pre-specified criteria. Regardless of the limitations in the study design described above and the data collection issues with the original application, the PFS result is both statistically significant and clinically meaningful for patients with this disease. This was confirmed by sensitivity analyses demonstrating an HR range from 0.15-0.46, which is supportive of the findings from this trial.</p><p>Additional support for the indicated population for Lutathera are based on the effects observed on ORR and DoR for patients with NETs other than those arising in the midgut. The ERASMUS Medical Center trial (ERASMUS) was an investigator-sponsored, open-label, single-arm, singleinstitution, expanded access study of 1214 patients with SSTR positive neuroendocrine (NEC) tumors conducted in The Netherlands from January 2000 through December 2012. Sixty-seven percent of enrolled patients were from the Netherlands, and the remaining 33% were referred from outside of the Netherlands. The study population was heterogeneous with respect to primary tumor site. Most patients had GEP-NETs of the foregut, midgut, hindgut, digestive tract, bronchus, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET). Other NETs were also included in the trial, specifically medullary thyroid cancer, pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, neuroblastoma, and Merkel cell carcinoma. Non-NET SSRT positive tumors melanoma, non-differentiated thyroid cancers, non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, lymphoma, and malignant meningioma were also treated. In ERASMUS, lutetium Lu 177 dotatate 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) was administered every 6 to 13 weeks for up to 4 doses concurrently with the recommended amino acid solution. There was no pre-specified statistical analysis plan. The major efficacy outcome was investigator-assessed ORR. The response assessment criteria changed during the trial, with patients treated later being evaluated by RECIST, which is accepted for regulatory purposes.</p><p>To assess the impact of differences in response assessments in the trial, a sensitivity analysis was performed stratifying by date which correlates to responses assessed by investigators using SWOG criteria and converted algorithmically to RECIST criteria (patients before <ref type="bibr">March 15, 2007)</ref> and responses assessed by investigators using RECIST (patients on or after 3/15/2007). Of 1214 patients enrolled in the trial, 360</p><p>Reference ID: 4211167 NDA/BLA Multidisciplinary Review and Evaluation NDA 207800 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate (Lutathera) <ref type="bibr">15</ref> Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) (30%) had GEP-NETs and were included in the subset analysis. The mean age was 61 years, 52% were male, 61% had a baseline Karnofsky performance status of ≥ 90, 61% had progressed within 12 months of treatment, and 15% had received prior chemotherapy. More than 90% of these patients received a concomitant somatostatin analogue.</p><p>The analysis of the two populations of patients demonstrated consistently higher estimates of ORR in the population assessed using SWOG criteria and converted to RECIST algorithmically. Limiting the analysis to patients evaluated on or after <ref type="bibr">March 15, 2007</ref>, provided a more conservative estimate of benefit in this trial. There were 58 responders in the subgroup (CR: 3; PR: 55). The estimated response rate was 16% (95%CI: 12%, 20%). The median duration of response was 35 months (range: 0, 70+ months; 95% CI: 17.0, 38.0 months). Although from a subset of patients treated, these data provide statistically conservative estimates that were verifiable and are clinically meaningful for patients with GEP-NET. The results provide additional support for the indicated population that are consistent with the observed benefit in other populations of patients with the disease (i.e., in NETTER-1), the biology of the disease itself, the mechanism of action of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate, and the limited treatment options available for these patients.</p><p>The safety profile for lutetium Lu 177 dotatate in patients with GEP-NETS is characterized by exposure data from approximately 922 patients who received at least one dose of the drug and were treated in the two trials submitted to support safety: NETTER-1, and ERASMUS. The FDA safety review focused primarily on the patients treated in NETTER-1, with some additional analyses involving the Dutch patients from the ERASMUS trial, because data collection and follow-up data for these patients in the ERASMUS study appeared to be more complete.</p><p>Drug exposure in NETTER-1 was a total of ≥ 600 mCi of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate in 79.3% of patients treated, and 26% of patients received cumulative doses of ≥ 800 mCi. Seventy-six percent of patients received all four planned doses. Dose reductions were reported for 6% of patients and 13% of patients discontinued the drug. The median duration of follow-up for the lutetium Lu 177 dotatate and octreotide LAR arms was 24 and 20 months, respectively. The most common adverse reactions observed in patients treated with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate were nausea (65%), vomiting (53%), fatigue (38%), diarrhea (26%), abdominal pain (26%), and decreased appetite (21%). The most common Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate were lymphopenia (44%), increased GGT (20%) vomiting (7%), nausea and elevated AST (5% each), increased ALT, hyperglycemia, and hypokalemia (4% each).</p><p>Safety data from the ERASMUS trial included 811 patients; 65% received a total cumulative dose of ≥ 800 mCi, and 81% received a cumulative dose ≥ 600 mCi of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate. With a median follow-up time of more than 4 years, the most serious chronic toxicities reported were myelodysplastic syndrome (2%), renal failure (2%), cardiac failure (2%), acute leukemia (1%), myocardial infarction (1%), and neuroendocrine hormonal crisis (1%). These tumors are principally divided into those that are well-differentiated and poorlydifferentiated, with the distinction made based on the degree of cell differentiation, tumor architecture, and tumor grade. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies GEP-NETs into low-grade (G1), intermediate grade (G2), and high grade (G3) categories, based upon mitotic count, assessment for necrosis, and proliferative index or Ki-67. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The European Neuroendocrine Tumour Society (ENETS) stratifies tumors by grade and stage, <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4</ref> and both organizations combine grading with staging using the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) system. GEP-NETs are also described by the tissue of origin with tumors of the lung, thymus, stomach, duodenum, and pancreas considered foregut tumors; tumors of the ileum, cecum and proximal colon are midgut tumors; and tumors of the distal colon and rectum are hindgut tumors.</p><p>GEP-NETs may be further characterized as functional or non-functional, depending on whether they secrete peptide hormones that result in clinical symptoms. Functional GEP-NETs are generally well-differentiated, and these tumors are codified to reflect the hypersecreted hormone (e.g. insulinoma, gastrinoma). The most commonly produced hormone is serotonin, which results in "carcinoid syndrome" that is characterized by flushing and diarrhea. The clinical symptoms associated with functional tumors frequently lead to their diagnosis at an earlier stage compared with non-functional tumors that often present with symptoms related to mass effect or metastatic disease. The majority of well-differentiated GEP-NETs express somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) and can be imaged using a radiolabeled form of the somatostatin analog octreotide (e.g. 111-In pentetreotide). Treatment of functional GEP-NETs requires management of clinical symptoms in addition to anti-cancer therapy.</p><p>The natural history of GEP-NET varies considerably and appears to be affected by the primary site of disease, degree of differentiation, expression of SSTRs, and presence of metastases at NDA/BLA Multidisciplinary Review and Evaluation NDA 207800 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate (Lutathera) 24 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) diagnosis. Tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas have similar histologic appearances, but pancreatic NETs (pNETs) tend to have a more aggressive course, albeit with higher responses to systemic therapy. The approach to initial treatment of GEP-NET consists of wide surgical resection for limited or locally advanced disease, if feasible, and treatment of hormone-related symptoms. For asymptomatic patients with slow progression, observation with routine surveillance imaging is an option, while somatostatin analogs (SSAs) such as octreotide are used for patients with hormone-related symptoms. Although SSAs were primarily used to manage the hormonal symptoms related to NETs, in vitro studies demonstrated the potential for SSAs to exert anti-proliferative activity and clinical studies have demonstrated prolonged PFS in patients with NETs treated with octreotide and lanreotide.</p><p>The prognosis for patients with metastatic well-differentiated GEP-NETs is highly variable. Based on retrospective analyses of large databases, the median OS for patients with metastatic pancreatic NETs has been reported to range from 2-5.8 years 1,5 while the median OS for small bowel NET has been reported as 7.9 years. 6</p></div>

Systemic therapy options for well-differentiated, metastatic GEP-NETs include SSAs (e.g., octreotide, lanreotide), targeted therapies, and chemotherapy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Somatostatin analogs (SSAs):</head><p>Although SSAs are primarily used to manage the hormonal symptoms related to NETs, in vitro studies demonstrated the potential for SSAs to exert anti-proliferative activity and clinical studies have demonstrated prolonged PFS in patients with NETs treated with octreotide and lanreotide. SSAs exert their effects through binding to SSTRs and the presence of these receptors, determined using radionuclide scintigraphy, is generally predictive of response to these agents. Octreotide may be administered as a short acting formulation or as a longer active depot formulation. Octreotide is approved for the symptomatic treatment of patients with GEP-NETs. Lanreotide is another long-acting depot formulation that is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with unresectable, well-or moderately-differentiated, locally advanced or metastatic GEP-NETs, to improve progression-free survival.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chemotherapy:</head><p>Traditional chemotherapeutic agents include streptozocin in combination with 5-fluorouracil or doxorubicin. Temozolomide, capecitabine, and oxaliplatin alone or in combination therapy have also demonstrated anti-tumor activity. Streptozocin is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic islet cell cancer, and has been the backbone of combination treatment regimens with 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin; however, toxicity related to renal dysfunction has limited its use. Sunitinib is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of progressive, well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease. Everolimus is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of progressive pNET and progressive, well-differentiated, non-functional NET of gastrointestinal or lung origin that are unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Summary of Presubmission/Submission Regulatory Activity</head><p>The regulatory history as provided by Dr. Joohee Sul in the review of the original submission is reproduced here for continuity and updated to reflect events occurring on and after December 19, 2016.</p><p>• June 14, 2007: A pre-IND meeting was held with BioSynthema Inc. and FDA under IND 77219, to discuss the development program for 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate for patients with somatostatin receptor positive NETs.</p><p>• January 2009: 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate was designated as an orphan drug for the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs).</p><p>• March 8, 2011: A pre-IND parallel scientific advice meeting was held with FDA and EMA to discuss the acceptability of a proposed trial comparing the ORR observed in patients with inoperable midgut carcinoid tumors who experienced progressive disease while being treated with octreotide LAR randomized to 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate with those randomized to Sandostatin LAR Depot. FDA stated that while the subpopulation of midgut carcinoid tumors was an acceptable population for study, given the biological and clinical heterogeneity of GEP-NETs, it would be unlikely that an indication for the treatment of somatostatin receptor positive GEP-NETs would be granted based upon data derived from the proposed trial.</p><p>• April 23, 2012: The IND-enabling study (NETTER-1) was submitted to IND 77219.</p><p>• September 3, 2014: FDA acknowledged change in the sponsorship of IND 77219 from Biosynthema to AAA.</p><p>• October 22, 2014: AAA informed FDA of the DSMB recommendation to stop enrolment and cross over all patients to the Lutathera arm due to observed PFS benefit. AAA followed FDA and EMA advice to continue the trial per protocol.</p><p>• o A potential broader indication for patients with GEP-NET would require demonstration of a clinically meaningful anti-tumor effect (i.e. ORR by RECIST) as determined by independent review that is of sufficient magnitude and duration to be likely to predict clinical benefit and demonstrate an advance over available therapy in an adequate number of patients with progressive and inoperable bronchial NET or pancreatic NET treated with 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate at the dose and schedule employed in the NETTER-1 study, in one or more adequate and well-controlled trials. o The adequacy of the data from the EMC study to support the broader indication cannot be determined until the data is reviewed at the time of the NDA submission. o Possible approaches to developing an expanded access program were discussed.</p><p>• November 24, 2015: A pre-NDA meeting was scheduled. The pre-meeting package did not include completed analysis of safety data from NETTER-1; therefore, it was determined that there was insufficient information to reach agreement on the contents of an NDA under the PDUFA V program. The following key issues were discussed at the meeting:</p><p>o FDA reiterated that a potential indication for patients with GEP-NET will require demonstration of a clinically meaningful anti-tumor effect as described above. o FDA requested additional information on the results of the EMC trial. o FDA did not object to AAA's proposal to open an expanded access trial at NETTER-1 study sites and to allow patients in the NETTER-1 study who progress during treatment with Sandostatin LAR 60 mg to receive 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate. o FDA discouraged AAA from submitting the interim analysis of OS as the final analysis in the NDA and encouraged AAA to conduct additional analyses at later time points when a greater number of events have occurred. FDA emphasized that for the OS results to be included in the label, an effect on OS must meet the criteria for substantial evidence of efficacy.</p><p>• March 14, 2016: A pre-NDA meeting was held with FDA to discuss the submission of the NDA. The following key issues were addressed:</p><p>o FDA reiterated ongoing concerns regarding the utility of the data presented from the EMC and reiterated that a potential indication for patients with GEP-NET would require demonstration of a clinically meaningful ORR and DOR by RECIST as determined in one or more trials that are well designed, well executed and internally consistent. o Additional advice was provided concerning the content of the clinical pharmacology data o Additional advice was provided concerning the formatting of datasets.</p><p>• April 28, 2016: The NDA rolling submission was completed.</p><p>• A complete review of the data submitted in this NDA was found to be materially incomplete, inaccurate, untraceable, and inconsistent. As a result, it was not possible to confirm the effectiveness or safety of Lutathera for the proposed indication and a complete response letter (CR) was issued to the applicant on December 19, 2016.</p><p>• February 10, 2017: A type A teleconference was held with FDA to discuss the specific items presented in the CR letter, to detail the planned response, provide an overview of the response timing, and discuss the Expanded Access Program.</p><p>• July 26, 2017: The NDA was re-submitted.

In rats, intravenous administration of 175 Lutetium-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate at doses ≥ 1250 µg/kg had no effects on neurobehavioral endpoints (motor activity, behavior, co-ordination, somatic sensory/motor reflex responses and autonomic responses such as piloerection, pupil size, lachrymation, and salivation), or effects on overt cardiovascular and gastrointestinal function or body temperature in rats. Further support for the cardiovascular safety of the cold compound included its lack of effect on ECG parameters in the repeat dose toxicology study in dogs at single doses up to 3.2 mg/kg and an IC50 of &gt; 100 μM in the in vitro hERG assay, though mild dose-independent effects (≤ 22% increases) on systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure with concomitant decreases in heart rate did occur at doses as low as 40 μg/kg. At the highest dose of 20 mg/kg, 175 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate acted as a respiratory stimulant (increased respiratory rate, peak inspiratory and peak expiratory flows, inspiration and expiration times and minute volume). The no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 175 Lutetium-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate on respiratory parameters in conscious rats was 1250 μg/kg, when administered by the intravenous route.</p><p>The assessment of the potential for 175 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate to inhibit or induce human CYP450 enzymes showed that the compound does not act as an inhibitor or an inducer of the tested enzymes in the concentration range tested. <ref type="bibr">175</ref> Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate did not show any potential for P-gp specific interaction, either as a substrate or as an inhibitor. In general toxicology studies, the exposure to the test items increased in a dose-proportional manner without any accumulation in terms of exposure and peak concentration.</p><p>The applicant did not conduct carcinogenicity studies and these studies are not required to support the marketing application for a drug intended to treat advanced cancer. The cold product, 175 Lutetium-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate, was non-mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay and negative in mouse lymphoma cells in vitro. As 177 Lutetium-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate is a radioactive product, it is considered genotoxic. Consistent with the ICH S9 Guidance, because 177 Lutetium-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate is a genotoxic drug, no reproductive toxicology studies were conducted or required to support the registration of the drug. The risk of radiopharmaceuticals to a developing fetus is well-established in the scientific literature. The nonclinical team recommends a warning for the potential for embryo-fetal toxicity.</p></div>

Adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Reubi et al., 2000</ref> The applicant determined the IC50 for competitive binding of for several somatostatin analogs for somatostatin receptors (unspecified) using cell membranes from CA20948 pancreatic tumor cells (Study #20000801). The DOTA-TYR 3 -Octreotate construct inhibited binding to the cell membranes at IC50s below those determined for some other somatostatin analogs, including the approved somatostatin OctreoScan product. The applicant investigated the internalization of labelled-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate using somatostatin receptor (SST2R) expressing rat pancreatic acinar tumor cells (AR42J) (Study 20000420). Cells were maintained in F-12K medium and incubated at 37°C in triplicate with approximately 0.5 nM (0.1 to 0.25 μCi) of radiolabeled peptide for 4 hours, after which cellular uptake was terminated by removing medium from the cells and washing wells with 2 ml of PBS. The combined wash and media was counted to determine free activity at 4 hours. Fresh media was added to the cells and incubation was continued. At 16 hours, the wash cycle was repeated and the remaining cells were transferred into PBS for determination of retained activity. Free and internalized radioactivity levels were determined using a Packard Cobra Gamma counter (Picker International, USA). Pancreatic acinar tumor cells showed similar uptake for both compounds.</p><p>NDA/BLA Multidisciplinary Review and Evaluation NDA 207800 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate (Lutathera) 33 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews)   Compared to single dose administration at the same dose level, an increased number of animals receiving 3 doses of 177 Lu-DOTA-Y 3 -Octreotate had sustained tumor regression. Tumor growth in rats that received a 1 mg/kg blocking dose of cold peptide in addition to a single 2.5 mCi dose was, however, identical to the growth observed in untreated animals, showing that the radiotherapeutic effect was receptor mediated ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>). Despite increases in tumor-free survival compared to that seen at lower doses, treatment of animals with multiple doses of 177 Lu-DOTA-Y 3 -Octreotate at the high dose of 5 mCi did result in long term toxicity, with most animals in this group developing renal disease and dying beginning 9 months post-treatment. Renal lesions (nodules and large neoplasms) were the only observed neoplasms (macroscopic inspection) in these animals, indicating that the kidney is the critical organ for toxicity. No attempt was made to reduce kidney uptake using protecting agents (free amino acids) in this study ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref>).    Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate in pooled human liver microsomes can act as a mild direct inhibitor of CYP2C9 (32.9% at 10 μM).

The selection of the therapeutic dosing regimen for 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate was based on dosimetry data from a dose escalation study (Erasmus) which resulted in a cumulative radiation dose that remained near but below the defined radiation toxicity threshold to the kidney (23 Gy) and bone marrow (2 Gy). No exposure-response analysis for either efficacy or safety could be performed because PK samples were collected in only 8% (19/249) of patients in the NETTER-1 study. Based on the lack of relationship between creatinine clearance and hematological toxicities in the NETTER-1 study, no dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The use of lysine/arginine amino acid solution as a renal protectant is supported by the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution sub-study in the Erasmus study. Co-administration of amino acids reduced the median radiation dose to the kidneys by 47% (range: 34%-59%) and increased the mean beta phase blood clearance of 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate by 36% (CV: 21%).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Endpoints</head><p>The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of tumor progression using RECIST 1.1 criteria as assessed by the IRC or death from any cause.</p><p>Key secondary efficacy endpoints were: overall response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of all randomized patients with the best overall response of partial response (PR) or complete response (CR), and overall survival (OS), defined as the time from randomization to the date of death from any cause, or to the last contact at the date of data cut-off, during the entire study period (treatment phase and follow-up phase).</p><p>Quality of Life (QoL) was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EOTC QLQ-G.I.NET21 questionnaires which were filled in by the patient prior to receiving the CT/MRI imaging results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis Plan</head><p>Based on the FDA's Complete Response letter to the original NDA submission, the applicant revised the statistical analysis plan (SAP) to V3. The SAP subsection reflects the SAP V3, ADRG, ADRG addendums, and CSR V2.0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Size Considerations</head><p>Assuming that the median PFS was 14 months in the octreotide arm and 30 months in the Lutathera arm, a total of 74 centrally confirmed PFS events per IRC assessment were needed to detect a hazard ratio of 0.47 with 90% power at a 2-sided alpha level of 5%.</p><p>The trial was also designed to test OS. Assuming the median OS was 32 months in the octreotide LAR arm and 50 months in the Lutathera arm, a total of 158 death events were needed to detect a hazard ratio of 0.64 with 80% power at a 1-sided alpha level of 2.5%. An interim analysis was planned at the time of PFS analysis. The O'Brien-Fleming (OBF) boundary method was used with respective alpha allocation of 0.000085 for the OS interim analysis. Based on a lack of number of projected OS events at the planned interim analysis, the meaning of 0.000085 is unclear. The actual end-of-study would be conducted at 158 death events or after 5 years from the randomization date of the last randomized patient, whichever occurs first.</p><p>Upon further clarification, the applicant conducted neither unplanned PFS nor OS interim analysis. At the request of the FDA, one additional updated analysis of OS, with data cut-off of June 30, 2016, was also included in this NDA resubmission with no alpha allocation penalty applied as agreed to with FDA.</p><p>Based on the actual planned and updated OS analysis, FDA calculated the alpha allocation using the OBF boundary method via the EAST 6.6.1 software ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 10</ref>).

The alpha for the final OS analysis is 0.049. Major secondary endpoints include OS and ORR. A hierarchical procedure was proposed to adjust for multiplicity in testing the secondary endpoints in the order of ORR and OS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis Sets</head><p>The following analysis sets were defined:</p><p>• The primary efficacy analysis population was the intent-to-treat (ITT) study population, which was categorized by the treatment arm to which they were assigned at randomization, regardless of the actual treatment received.

For analyses, patients were categorized by the actual treatment received.</p><p>The ITT was used for all analyses of efficacy, demographics, and baseline disease characteristics. The PPS was used for the sensitivity efficacy analyses. The SAF was used for all safety analyses.</p></div>

Twenty-three patients were selected for the PK sub-study and were not randomized. Twenty-two patients in the PK substudy were treated. In the randomized cohort, two remaining patients were screened but were randomized after the efficacy cut-off date and were not included in the efficacy analysis.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol Violations/Deviations</head><p>Overall, 59 major protocol violations were reported in 48 (22%) (Lutathera: 23 [21%]); octreotide LAR 25 [22%]) patients. Eight additional randomized patients received no treatment, resulting in 56 (24%) patients on the ITT having major protocol violations. The breakdown of major protocol violations by study arm is shown below: Source: AAA-III-01(NETTER-1) CSR V2; Version Date: 5July2017), <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 10</ref>-2, page 89</p><p>The number of patients with Inclusion/exclusion criteria not met was comparable between arms. The number of patients assessed as having an incorrect study procedure was higher in the octreotide arm. This was largely attributable to a higher number of patients reported to have poor quality assessments in the octreotide arm (8% vs 2%).</p><p>While the overall rate of major protocol violations in the NETTER-1 trial appears high, more problematic in terms of the efficacy analysis was the discrepancy between study arms in the number of patients with a delay between the baseline tumor assessment and the first study treatment. While up to 12 weeks between baseline screening and the date of first treatment was allowed per protocol, 14% of patients on the Lutathera arm and only 1% of patients on the octreotide arm had a delay of 30 days or more between the baseline screen and the date of first treatment. The potential impact of the delay in initial treatment on the analysis of PFS is further discussed under the efficacy result for PFS subsection.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographic Characteristics</head><p>A total of 229 patients were randomized in a 1:1 allocation (Lutathera: 116; octreotide: 113). The two trial arms were generally comparable in age, sex, race, region of enrollment, and baseline Karnofsky performance status.</p><p>NDA/BLA Multidisciplinary Review and Evaluation NDA 207800 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate (Lutathera) 74 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews)  <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 15</ref> summarizes baseline disease characteristics in the ITT population based on the efficacy analysis data cut-off. Patients in the two trial arms were generally similar with respect to baseline disease characteristics. Seventy-four percent had primary tumor in the Ileum. Most had well differentiated tumors (ENET Grade 1). Eighty-six percent had a tumor burden reported as limited. Nearly 96% of patients were reported to have metastatic disease which included metastatic disease in the liver. Based on reports of concomitant symptoms, the study groups were comparable in the number of patients with secretory tumors.</p><p>NDA/BLA Multidisciplinary Review and Evaluation NDA 207800 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate (Lutathera) 76 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) therapy, or chemotherapy (37% vs 27%). This treatment arm included protein kinase inhibitors. The implication of this finding is unclear but may suggest that patients in the Lutathera arm were more heavily pretreated. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stratification Factors</head><p>The two trial arms appeared similar in terms of the pre-specified stratification factors: time on a constant dose of octreotide and the highest OctreoScan tumor uptake score (details in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table  17</ref>).  The neuroendocrine marker profiles were generally similar between study arms at baseline (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 18</ref>).  from randomization in the two arms of the NETTER-1 trial was performed to evaluate the impact of an imbalance in the time to scheduled tumor assessment on the PFS analysis. Regarding the local/investigator tumor evaluation up to the first progression of disease, the time to scan from randomization was (nominally) statistically significantly different between the two study arms at the first 8 tumor assessment visits <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">(Table 20)</ref>. However, an analysis of the time to scan from study treatment start, found no (nominally) statistically significant difference between the two study arms at all assessment visit times <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">(Table 21</ref>).  Time to tumor assessment analyses presented in the above show that the asymmetric tumor assessment from the randomization date is due to the time-lag in the first post randomization tumor assessment resulting from a delay in the initiation of treatment in the Lutathera arm. The asymmetric tumor assessment from the randomization date is inherited from protocol modification to follow FDA's ITT principle. In general, pre-planned primary PFS analysis followed the FDA's Guidance for Industry: Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer Drugs and Biologics. However, the statistical reviewer noted the following review issues:</p><p>• The applicant used a 210-day gap as the threshold to calculate the flag of two continuous missing tumor assessments in the primary PFS analysis. FDA recommended that AAA use 175 [(12 * 2+1) *7] days instead. A 175-day gap as the threshold to calculate the flag of two continuous missing tumor assessments is one of the applicant's sensitivity analyses.</p><p>• There was asymmetric delayed 1st treatment post randomization between two treatment arms as well as asymmetric tumor assessments from randomization <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">(Table  20)</ref>.</p><p>• SAP V3 states that "baseline CT scan/MRI must not be older than 4 weeks before the projected randomization date. In order to provide a consistent CT/MRI scan time-point between the two arms of the study it may be necessary for the site to repeat the baseline CT/MRI scan immediately before randomization if the CT/MRI time-point is greater than 4 weeks before randomization to provide more recent and protocolcompliant lesion data." Based on the submitted SAS program and data, there were 3 patients where the post randomization date was used as their baseline tumor assessment date and 90 (39%) patients where the baseline CT scan/MRI was obtained more than 28 days prior to the randomization date. Of note, the imaging reading center had re-evaluated the tumor assessments. The IRC-adjudicated visit specific tumor response results were reported in the SDTM RS domain, the review could not trace back to the target lesion PD derivation, which should be based on at least 30% increase in the sum of largest lesion diameters from the pre-randomization baseline tumor assessment.</p><p>• The SAP also stated that "A radiological assessment is considered as an adequate assessment if the RECIST response (as per IRC) is CR, PR, SD or PD. A response of NE or missing will not be considered as an adequate assessment, and the visit will be considered missing for the analysis, as presented in the table above." However, NE was part of tumor response derivation as stated in the RECIST 1.1.</p><p>• As described in the ADTTE2 SAS program, the PFS censoring rule related to the last known alive date used imputed dates and used information after the efficacy data cutoff. Specifically, concomitant medication date, disposition, death date, and progress start date used imputed information. The last known alive date for the entire ITT population was derived from actual complete date, imputed complete dates, or efficacy cut date. This data manipulation occurred before applying the censoring rules. Following FDA's conventional censoring rule, the reviewer re-derived PFS data. Per FDA's sensitivity analysis, the un-stratified log-rank test P value was also reported to be less Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) than 0.0001. The median PFS was not reached for the Lutathera arm and 5.4 months (95% CI: 3.3, 17.9) for the octreotide arm. The corresponding un-stratified HR was reported as 0.15 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.28) in the Lutathera arm compared to the octreotide arm. The discordance between FDA's analysis and applicant's is due to the high censoring rate. Hence, FDA considers the applicant's primary PFS analysis as an exploratory analysis.</p><p>Due to above review issues, FDA assessed PFS events if a patient had disease progression or death regardless of whether the patient had missing scheduled visits, treatment discontinuation for toxicity, or new anticancer treatment started without progression. This analysis was consistent with the approach described in FDA's Guidance for Industry: Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Drugs and Biologics Guidance for Industry (although the guidance is for NSCLC disease, the principle is the same); furthermore, the involved dates are not imputed or replaced. FDA's primary PFS analysis is one of applicant's sensitivity analysis, which is reported in the ADTTE2 domain in the variable PFS4.    <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 23</ref> presents the ORR and DoR analyses based on the IRC assessments in the ITT population. The Lutathera arm demonstrated an improvement in ORR compared with octreotide arm. The Fisher's exact test P value was 0.0148. The ORRs were 13% (95% CI: 6.8%, 19.0%), and 4% (95% CI: 0.1%, 6.9%) in the Lutathera arm and octreotide arm, respectively. The DoR was not reached for the Lutathera arm and was 1.9 months (95% CI: 1.9, NE) for the octreotide arm.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 24</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref> presents the applicant's OS analysis results with a total of 48 deaths at the pre-planned OS interim analysis and 71 deaths based on FDA's requested updated OS analysis. Compared to the OBF-utilized 2-sided alpha allocation of 0.00008, and 0.002 for the interim and updated OS analysis, respectively, neither analysis demonstrated a statistical significant improvement in OS. FDA noted that the applicant used imputed dates to derive OS.</p><p>In the updated OS analysis, two patients who were randomized after the efficacy cut-off were included in the analysis population.      Patients were treated using an institutional protocol derived from the study of other high-dose radiolabeled peptides conducted at EMC using a different commercial product. ERASMUS included no formal prespecified statistical analysis plan. The protocol for ERASMUS included in the NDA submission is described as "a protocol describing retrospectively a study with prospectively collected data that was performed between January 2000 and March 2007," which was conducted "in agreement with the declaration of Helsinki." The protocol in the NDA submission is dated November 18, 2008. Prospective collection of data on case report forms (CRFs) was limited. Data from the CRFs and patient files were prospectively entered in a master Excel database by the principal investigator for statistical analysis for publication. Follow-up data on the non-Dutch patients was less complete than on the Dutch patients. AAA employed an independent CRO to retrospectively verify the ERASMUS study source data and generate a SAS database for statistical analysis. Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) Two separate analyses were conducted on the ERASMUS data: The following specific concerns about the ERASMUS trial have previously been noted:</p><p>• There was no formal clinical protocol or prespecified statistical analysis plan; a protocol which summarized the procedures followed along with a statistical analysis plan was retrospectively generated and provided with the NDA submission. • Baseline tumor assessments were obtained for only 578/1214 (48%) EMC study patients. • Patients were not required to have disease progression following the most recent prior therapy for NET. • There was no central review of histology or of OctreoScan uptake at baseline • There was no central review of response, and except for a small subset of Dutch patients (n=38), a retrospective central review was not attempted. • There was a high loss to follow-up among non-Dutch participants and a differential reporting of serious adverse events between Dutch and non-Dutch participants, resulting in a high degree of censoring and under-reporting of safety events among non-Dutch participants. • Prospective data collection was limited and was supplemented by retrospective medical records review and data verification in the Dutch subset of patients only. • Follow-up assessments measured by CT or MRI were obtained less regularly and less frequently than in the NETTER-1 trial (at 6 weeks, 3-4, 6-8, 9-12 and 12-16 months after the last administered dose of 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate and every 6 months thereafter until disease progression, death, or loss to follow-up). </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Analysis Sets</head><p>Safety Population (SAF): The SAF consists of all patients who entered the trial and who received at least one dose of Lutathera. This population will be used for all safety parameters and efficacy analyses. The SAF is the primary analysis population in the provided protocol and SAP (Section 7.5.1) which is consistent for regulatory consideration for the single arm clinical trial. FAS excluded 67% of patients without baseline tumor assessment is the sensitivity analysis population.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ORR</head><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was investigator-assessed objective tumor response rate (CR or PR) using RECIST 1.1. For all the ORR analyses, patients without a valid post-baseline scan were defined as non-responders. Tumors were measured using CT or MRI. Baseline tumor assessments could be obtained within 6 months prior to the start of treatment. Response assessments were done at 6 weeks, 3-4, 6-8, 9-12, and 12-16 months following the last treatment, and then every 6 months thereafter or until disease progression.</p><p>Patients included in the first data analysis (615 patients enrolled prior to <ref type="bibr">March 15, 2007)</ref> were evaluated using Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) assessment criteria. Patients enrolled after <ref type="bibr">March 15, 2007 (n=599)</ref> were assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria.</p><p>The primary difference between the SWOG and RECIST tumor grading systems was the manner in which target lesions were identified and non-target tumor lesions were handled. In RECIST, a maximum of 2 target lesions are identified per organ and 5 target lesions in total are used. In SWOG, up to 5 target lesions per organ are allowed; a maximum of 3 target lesions per organ are allowed if the patient has more than 20 measurable lesions. In that case, all other lesions in Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) that organ site are listed as a single evaluable lesion. To perform the conversion to RECIST, the longest diameter of each target lesion was extracted from the SWOG bi-dimensional measurements and the sum of the longest diameter of each target lesion was calculated based on the extracted longest diameters at each visit. In SWOG assessments where 3 target lesions per organ were selected at baseline, the longest diameter of all target lesions was used. The algorithm accounted for the appearance of new lesions. Non-target lesions were only indirectly assessed as they contributed to the assessment of non-measurable or evaluable disease in the determination of objective status.</p><p>For those patients enrolled after <ref type="bibr">March 15, 2007</ref>, who were assessed for response using RECIST criteria, the same computer algorithm was applied to the sum of the longest diameter of the target lesions to determine the response status in the database.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DoR</head><p>DoR is defined as the time from initially meeting the criteria for response (CR or PR) until the time of progression by RECIST 1.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Analysis Methods</head><p>For categorical variable, (e.g., ORR), descriptive analyses including proportion and binomial exact confidence intervals (95% CI) were planned.</p><p>Descriptive statistics for continuous variables (e.g., DoR), would be number of non-missing value, quartiles, arithmetic mean, standard deviation (sd), minimum, median, and maximum.

Out of 98 potential patients, only 38 had scans retrievable for independent review of ORR ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 18</ref>). • GEP-NET: A subset of 433 patients (360 Dutch; 73 Non-Dutch).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographic Characteristics</head><p>Demographic characteristics of the FAS and SAF analysis sets are shown below. Overall, 54% of patients in ERASMUS were male, the median age was 58 years, 67% were Dutch and 63% had a Karnofsky performance status above 90. Except for the percentage of Dutch patients which was higher in the FAS study population, the FAS and SAF analysis sets were generally similar with respect to these basic demographic characteristics.  Overall, 70% of patients enrolled in ERASMUS had gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine (GEP-NET) or bronchial neuroendocrine tumors. Fifty-eight percent were assessed to have progressive disease at the time of enrollment. Eighty-three percent had an OctreoScan uptake score of 3-4. Nineteen percent had had prior chemotherapy as treatment for their tumors. The FAS was generally similar to the SAF with respect to these baseline disease characteristics. Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Results -DoR and ORR</head><p>In ERASMUS, 247 responses (CR: 20; PR= 227) were reported among 1214 enrolled patients in the SAF population. The estimated response rate was 20% (95%CI: 18%, 23%). The median duration of response was 19.4 months (range: 0, 95 months; 95% CI: 16.6, 23.7 months). The response rate in the subset of patients with GEP-NET or bronchial neuroendocrine tumors was 198/811 (23%; 95% CI: 20.4, 26.1 months). The median duration of response was 20.1 months (range: 0, 95 months; 95% CI: 16.7, 24.4 months). The response rate in the subset of patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) appeared at least as good as for all patients with GEP-NETs and bronchial neuroendocrine tumors, and the responses among patients with PNETs were durable. These analyses were conducted on the SAF population which included all treated patients. The 403 (33%) patients with no baseline studies and patients with no followup assessments were considered non-responders (generally consistent with the approach FDA has taken on other applications).</p><p>To assess the impact of the high percentage of patients missing baseline assessments, a sensitivity analysis was conducted comparing estimates of ORR based on the SAF dataset which includes all enrolled patients, with and without baseline scans, to estimates of ORR in the FAS which is limited to patients with baseline scans. As expected, ORR is consistently lower when the SAF population is used. However, since it is not possible to ascertain whether exclusion of these patients without scans resulted in a systematic bias in the estimate, this reviewer recommends the analysis using the SAF population rather than the FAS, which yields a more conservative estimate of ORR <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">(Table 31)</ref>.</p><p>To assess the impact of enrollment timeframe, a sensitivity analysis was conducted that stratified patients by date of enrollment (analysis population 1: enrolled prior to <ref type="bibr">March 15, 2007</ref> vs. analysis population 2: enrolled on or after <ref type="bibr">March 15, 2007)</ref>. This analysis demonstrates consistently higher estimates of ORR in the population enrolled during the earlier timeframe. Before <ref type="bibr">March 15, 2007</ref>, responses were graded by investigators using SWOG criteria and converted algorithmically to RECIST criteria; on or after March 15, 2007, responses were assessed by investigators using RECIST (analysis population 2). Thus, limiting the analysis to patients enrolled on or after <ref type="bibr">March 15, 2007</ref>, provides a more conservative estimate. A total of 387 patients with GEP-NET and bronchial carcinoid tumors were enrolled in ERASMUS after <ref type="bibr">March 15, 2007</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 17</ref>). There were 60 responders in this subgroup (CR: 3; PR: 57). The estimated response rate was 16% (95%CI: 12%, 20%). The median duration of response was 35 months (range: 0, 70+ months; 95% CI: 17.0, 38.0 months). As FDA stated in the pre-BLA meeting held on March 14, 2016, FDA does not view time to event analyses (TTP, PFS, and OS) to be interpretable in the context of the single arm Erasmus trial.</p><p>With quality of life endpoints, the limited ascertainment of baseline assessments, the high drop-out rate for subsequent ascertainments, and the open-label nature of the trial limits the inference that can be drawn from the analyses of these data.</p><p>FDA clinical/statistical reviewers did not independently review the data.</p><p>Therefore, FDA's confirmation of study endpoints in ERASMUS was restricted to ORR and DoR.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Analyses Conducted on the Individual Trial</head><p>In an attempt to compare the ORR observed in ERASMUS with the ORR in NETTER-1, AAA presented an exploratory analysis using a subset of ERASMUS patients diagnosed with midgut NET with baseline scans available for review who were reported to have had progression following their most recent treatment prior to study enrollment ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 18</ref>). The analysis was limited to the Dutch subset to maximize the possibility of retrieving scans for independent review. Out of a subset of 51 patients with potentially retrievable scans, only 38 were retrievable. These were independently reviewed using RECIST 1.1 criteria. The result of this exploratory analysis is shown below in <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 32</ref>.</p><p>In the limited and highly selected subset of ERASMUS patients with progressive midgut NETs available for independent review, the response rate appears to be in the range of that observed in the NETTER-1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.1">Safety Review Approach</head><p>The Lutathera safety database was composed of data from three sources: NETTER-1, ERASMUS, and the expanded access/compassionate use database <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 19</ref>).</p><p>NETTER-1 provided a prospective and pre-specified safety monitoring plan for patients with locally advanced or metastatic, progressive, somatostatin receptor positive midgut neuroendocrine tumors. Patients were randomized to receive Lutathera plus standard dose octreotide LAR (30 mg q month) (n=111) or high-dose octreotide LAR (60 mg q 4 weeks) (n=112) which served as the comparator arm in this open-label trial. Twenty-two additional nonrandomized patients enrolled in the NETTER-1 dosimetry sub-study were treated and followed in the same manner as were patients randomized to the Lutathera arm. Review of NETTER-1 focused on the differential analysis of deaths, serious adverse events, and adverse events of special interest occurring on study and through the duration of the follow-up period. The small number of patients enrolled on the Lutathera arm of NETTER-1 limits the potential for detection of rare adverse events. The median duration of follow-up for this study of 19 months may allow for detection of some delayed safety signals.</p><p>The Erasmus Medical Center Study (ERASMUS) was a large single institution, international, investigator initiated, open-label, single arm treatment trial. Patients were treated with Lutathera in a manner similar to that in the NETTER-1 trial. In ERASMUS, serious adverse events were not formally recorded in a case report form or reported to a dedicated Safety Officer on an ongoing basis. Therefore, AAA employed an independent Clinical Research Organization (CRO) to conduct a retrospective review of source data verification from the medical charts of all patients enrolled in the study. As part of this retrospective process, all potential SAEs were identified and listed in an Excel file. Additionally, a list of hematological and biochemical laboratory data with NCI CTCAE grade 3 and 4 toxicities was prepared by the CRO and integrated into the SAE listing. Other SAEs were not graded. The causality of all SAEs was retrospectively determined by the PI. All SAEs thought possibly or probably related to study drug treatment were graded as serious adverse reactions (SARs). Narratives were written for all SARs and narratives were written for all SAEs where death occurred within 30 days from Lutathera treatment. Differential rates of serious adverse events between the Dutch and non-Dutch patients in ERASMUS and the high rate of non-Dutch patients lost to follow-up suggested under reporting in this trial. The approach taken with ERASMUS was to review data from this trial to identify sentinel, rare adverse events and adverse events of special interest not identified in NETTER-1, acknowledging that estimates derived from this trial may underestimate the true risk. Finally, AAA provided data on a large and diverse population of patients treated under expanded access and compassionate use programs. The follow-up time available on these patients was limited and reporting focused on serious adverse events. Review on this patient population focused on screening for sentinel acute and short term serious adverse events not identified in the NETTER-1 trial.</p><p>The review will focus on results from the NETTER-1 trial with salient observations from ERASMUS and the expanded access/compassionate use databases incorporated in the review where relevant.</p><p>NDA/BLA Multidisciplinary Review and Evaluation NDA 207800 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate (Lutathera) 116 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) dose administered to patients in NETTER-1 was 25.6 GBq (range: 6.5-31.8 GBq) <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">(Table 35</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relevant characteristics of the safety population:</head><p>The demographic and baseline tumor characteristics of the safety analysis population (SAF) and the full analysis set (FAS) of the NETTER-1 were similar. Please refer to the analysis of the FAS described in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 14</ref>, <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 15</ref>, <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 16</ref>, <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 17</ref>, and <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 18</ref> in Section 8.1.1.

In ERASMUS, the SAF was generally similar to the FAS with the following exceptions:</p><p>• There were fewer Dutch patients in the SAF (67% vs 85%).</p><p>• The percent of patients with high Karnofsky Performance Score (≥ 90) was higher (70% vs 63%).

Patients in ERASMUS were more diverse with respect to the primary tumor site, tended to be slightly younger with a better performance status, had more extensive disease, and were more pre-treated than were patients in NETTER-1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adequacy of the safety database:</head><p>The safety database of NETTER-1 is small, including only 111 patients; however, follow-up assessments were generally completed at protocol defined intervals and the duration of followup was judged to be sufficient to allow for signal detection of anticipated delayed toxicities, primarily renal toxicity and hematologic toxicity.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 20: NETTER-1: Patients in Follow-up Over Time</head><p>While a large number of patients were potentially available for safety assessment in ERASMUS, only serious adverse events were reported in the safety database and no active follow-up of the non-Dutch patients was conducted at the Erasmus Medical Center. Furthermore, only data from the Dutch subset was verified against source documents in the retrospective review. Thus, for estimation of the risk of serious adverse events, the Dutch subset of ERASMUS is likely to more accurately reflect the true risk. Reports in the non-Dutch subset, while informative, are likely to under estimate the true risk due to under reporting. Erasmus, however, provides an opportunity to assess risks at dose ranges above the proposed indicated dose. The median follow-up time for the Dutch Subset was 35 months (SD: 26.7).</p><p>Overall, the safety database for Lutathera was considered adequate in size to assess the safety profile for common adverse events occurring during treatment. The duration of follow-up is likely to be adequate to provide a signal for delayed adverse events but not likely to allow for estimation of the magnitude of the risk.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Categorization of Adverse Events</head><p>In the NETTER-1, adverse events were graded according to the CTCAE, v 4.03. Verbatim terms were captured and classified across the MedDRA hierarchy using Version 18.0. In ERASMUS, verbatim event terms for serious adverse events were collected and mapped across the MedDRA hierarchy (version: 18.0). Adverse events were originally graded by investigators using the World Health Organization (WHO) toxicity grading criteria (The Chemotherapy Source Book 1992: Williams and Wilkens). Because of this discrepancy, and the retrospective nature of adverse event data collection, adverse event grades were not provided in the ERASMUS database with the exception of available laboratory data which was graded using CTCAE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Routine Clinical Tests</head><p>In NETTER-1, routine laboratory tests, including serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, serum total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, hemoglobin, platelet count, total leukocyte count, and absolute neutrophil count were assessed at minimum at baseline, within 2 weeks before and 4 ± 1 weeks after each treatment and then monthly through week 72. Patients were then assessed every 6 months thereafter through the end of the 5-year follow-up phase ( <ref type="table">Table 8</ref>). Since patients on the Lutathera arm could be treated with dosing delays following the initial dose, there was a discrepancy in the timing of routine laboratory assessments since few patients on the high-dose octreotide arm experienced dosing delays ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_29">Table 9</ref>).</p><p>In ERASMUS, routine laboratory tests were obtained for hematology, blood chemistry, and uranalysis.

In the Dutch NDA/BLA Multidisciplinary Review and Evaluation NDA 207800 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate (Lutathera) 121 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) subset, sixteen deaths (2%) occurred on treatment or within 30 days following the last treatment within the Dutch subset.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Serious Adverse Events</head><p>In the initial version of the NETTER-1 clinical protocol (AAA-III-01/Version 1.0) and through all amendments, a serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as:</p><p>Any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:</p><p>• Results in death;</p><p>• Is life-threatening; Note: "life-threatening" refers to an event in which the patient is at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe; • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; • Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect;</p><p>• Requires in-patient hospitalization or leads to prolongation of hospitalization, except for elective pre-planned hospitalizations.</p><p>Serious adverse events occurred in 37 (33%) of patients randomized to receive Lutathera and in 30 (27%) patients randomized to receive high-dose octreotide. <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">Table 39</ref> below lists serious adverse events occurring with an incidence of two percent or higher in the Lutathera arm and occurring more frequently in the Lutathera arm than in the control arm.  After review of the clinical narratives associated with the SAEs occurring in excess in Lutatheratreated patients, only two were assessed to be likely related to Lutathera and to be of clinical significance. One patient developed protracted G4 lymphopenia which may have been a predisposing factor to pneumocystis jirovicii pneumonia and one patient developed acute renal failure attributed to Lutathera-related nephrotoxicity and pre-renal azotemia.</p><p>Only serious adverse events (SAEs) were captured in the ERASMUS safety database. Events were captured using a retrospective medical record review to identify events judged to be potentially serious in nature and possibly or probably related to study drug. An analysis of the per-patient incidence of SAEs was conducted for the entire safety population and for the Dutch subset in which reporting was thought to be more complete. Although the per-patient incidence of SAEs was slightly higher in the Dutch sub-set compared to the total SAF, the pattern of SAEs reported was similar to the SAF.</p><p>The most commonly reported SAEs in ERASMUS were pancytopenia (10%), diarrhea (6%), abdominal pain (6%), anemia (5%); nausea, vomiting, and pyrexia (4% each); thrombocytopenia, constipation, pneumonia, dehydration, and dyspnea (3% each).  In ERASMUS, patients who were thought to have benefited from Lutathera treatment but who relapsed could receive additional treatment cycles at the discretion of the investigator. A total of 216 patients in ERASMUS received Lutathera doses in excess of the proposed indicated treatment dose. In an attempt to assess the toxicity associated with higher dose exposures, patients in ERASMUS who received doses in excess of 29.6 GBq (&gt;800 mCi) were compared to those receiving up to the maximum recommended dose of 29.6 GBq (800 mCi). The results are shown below in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 41</ref>. The incidence of hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicities appears to be higher in patient treated at doses above 29.6 GBq. However, interpretation of these findings is confounded by the fact that patients who progressed and required additional treatment likely had complications due to end stage disease.  Narratives of serious adverse events were reviewed to identify rare and/or unusual events assessed by the reviewer to be of potential clinical significance. In addition to the identified NDA/BLA Multidisciplinary Review and Evaluation NDA 207800 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate (Lutathera) 125 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) adverse events of special interest (AESI) discussed below in Section 8.2.5, two other types of events which were not identified in an assessment of common events were noteworthy. These included neuroendocrine release syndrome and hepatic toxicity. A discussion of these events is included in Section 8.2.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dropouts and/or Discontinuations Due to Adverse Effects</head><p>In NETTER-1, 7 (6%) patients experienced a treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) which required a dose reduction, all due to thrombocytopenia, and 14 (13%) patients discontinued Lutathera due to a TEAE. Three patients discontinued Lutathera due to hematologic toxicity, 5 patients due to a renal-related event, 2 related to disease progression, 2 due to underlying disease or a disease-related procedural complication, and 2 for events not clearly related to Lutathera. On the high-dose octreotide arm, 12 (11%) patients experienced a TEAE resulting in study discontinuation.</p></div>

The observed increase in all grade toxicity could also result from a differential follow-up of Lutathera treated patients in this open-label trial. Increased creatinine/renal failure, which occurred with a between arm difference of &gt; 10%, was an adverse event of special interest and is further examined in Section 8.2.5 (page 129).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hematotoxicity</head><p>Hematologic toxicity was anticipated based on the estimated cumulative radiation absorbed dose to the red marrow (Gy: mean=1.0; SD=0.8) for 4 treatment cycles of Lutathera in Netter-1.</p><p>In NETTER-1, lymphopenia (all grades) was the most frequent hematologic toxicity, present in 90% of Lutathera treated patients. In at least one SAE, lymphopenia may have contributed to susceptibility to an opportunistic infection (pneumocystis jirovicii pneumonia). Grade 3-4 lymphopenia was seen in 44% of Lutathera treated patients. Anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia were also common, occurring in 81%, 55%, 53%, and 26% of Lutathera treated patients, respectively (all grades).

This patient had a prior diagnosis of breast cancer, and although prior treatment with alkylator therapy and/or radiation therapy was not documented, such therapy may have represented antecedent risk factors. Three patients (3%) were identified with a possible diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The date of diagnosis ranged from 8 to 15 months following the initial Lutathera dose. In one case, the patient had a history of breast cancer with alkylator therapy administered 20 years prior to the diagnosis of MDS. In the other two cases, patients had underlying hematologic changes.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neuroendocrine hormonal crises</head><p>Neuroendocrine hormonal crises manifesting with flushing, intractable diarrhea, bronchospasm and hypotension was reported in 8 (1%) patients in the Dutch subset of ERASMUS. Hypotension as a PT was reported in 1%. The onset of symptoms typically occurred while on or within 24-48 hours after Lutathera administration. In 5 cases, symptoms were severe and required administration of intravenous octreotide and steroids. No cases of neuroendocrine hormonal crises were reported in NETTER-1; however, it is possible that less severe episodes of neuroendocrine hormonal crises were undetected. Monitoring of vital signs in the periinfusional time-period was not submitted in a manner that allowed analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Radiation-induced hepatotoxicity</head><p>Since Lutathera is primarily excreted by the kidneys rather than through hepatic metabolism, drug induced liver disease would not be expected. Two cases, both on the Lutathera arm met the laboratory criteria only for Hy's Law (BE01-005 at weeks 4 and 6; FR06-007 at week 24); however, both patients had confounding factors (i.e., biliary stint dysfunction; ascites and disease progression with a history of chronic liver disease). The pattern of liver test elevation seen in NETTER-1 was non-specific. The medical reviewer hypothesizes that liver damage may be related to radiation exposure to the liver and may be related to the hepatic tumor burden. However, since there was no quantitative or qualitative assessment of liver involvement in NETTER-1, this hypothesis could not be further explored. Hepatotoxicity with 177-Lu has not been previously reported.</p><p>In ERASMUS, the following events were of interest:</p><p>• 1045 -A 50-year-old Asian female with neuroendocrine tumor of unknown origin with hepatic metastases received 1 infusion of 7.5 GBq Lutathera and presented approximately 6 weeks later with pancytopenia, decreased fibrinogen, and prothrombin time &gt; 120 sec with a slightly prolonged PTT. Gross hepatomegaly and elevated liver function was reported. Disseminated intravascular coagulation was diagnosed. Two weeks later, the patient had a subdural hematoma requiring craniotomy for clot evacuation. At that time, liver function was improving and there were no signs of DIC. One month later, a CT scan showed massive liver in a 65-year-old female with a neuroendocrine tumor in the terminal ileum metastatic to liver and lymph nodes was hospitalized for cholestasis approximately 6 weeks following the initial Lutathera administration. An echo of the liver showed intrahepatic congestion secondary to edema or necrosis of hepatic metastases. The patient was also suffering from abdominal complaints which were thought to be related to high-dose octreotide. The dose was decreased and the patient improved and was discharged. Approximately 1 month later, the patient was again admitted due to cholestasis due to distal choledochal stenosis and a stent was placed.</p><p>• 946 -A 66-year-old female with peritoneal carcinoid with liver metastases and carcinoid syndrome developed increasing abdominal pain in the liver area 3 days after the first Lutathera dose. • 182 -A 29-year-old female with atypical carcinoid with liver and peritoneal metastases developed a diffuse pattern of Grade 3 hepatic enzyme elevation one month following the initial Lutathera dose:</p><p>The available information is not adequate to fully characterize the risk to patients due to radiation-related hepatotoxicity.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.3">Statistical Issues</head><p>Although the design and analysis of Trial NETTER-1 had limitations, ultimately, the large effect size observed in the trial was enough to overcome those limitations. After Complete Response to the original NDA submission on Dec 2017, the applicant resubmitted this NDA in CDISC format and conducted efficacy analysis more rigorously following FDA agreed upon SAP V3. However, some statistically related issues were inherited from the design and data collection.</p><p>The major statistical issues are: 1) this study used coin toss randomization method for the first 28 patients and permuted block randomization method for the rest of ITT population; 2) applicant's PFS and OS derivation used imputed dates which will not provide a reliable estimate; 3) Asymmetric delay of the first dose in the Lutathera arm caused asymmetric time to tumor assessment from randomization; 4) Per protocol, the PFS would be performed when the planned 74 PFS evaluable events was observed. At the same efficacy cut-off date, the resubmission has 91 PFS events; FDA's analysis has 105 PFS events. 0.52 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.84) with a nominal p-value of 0.0068 which is larger than the OBF stopping boundary 0.002. The median OS in the experimental arm is not reached.</p><p>FDA has previously expressed reservations concerning the limitations of the ERASMUS trial and the adequacy of this trial to support expansion of the proposed indication to include GEP-NET tumors:</p><p>• There was no formal clinical protocol or prespecified statistical analysis plan.</p><p>• Baseline tumor assessments were obtained for only 811/1214 (67%) patients.</p><p>• Patients were not required to have disease progression following the most recent prior therapy for NET. • There was no central review of histology or of OctreoScan uptake at baseline or response • Prospective data collection was limited and was supplemented by retrospective medical records review and data verification in the Dutch subset of patients only. • Follow-up assessments measured by CT or MRI were obtained less regularly and less frequently than in the NETTER-1 trial. • Two different response criteria were used during the study.</p><p>The above limitations concerning ERASMUS suggest that despite its size, the conclusions drawn from this trial concerning the efficacy and safety of Lutathera must be interpreted with caution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.4">Conclusions and Recommendations</head><p>Efficacy: Randomization was stratified by OctreoScan tumor uptake score (Grade 2, 3 or 4) and the length of time that patients had been on the most recent constant dose of octreotide prior to randomization (≤ 6 or &gt; 6 months) through coin toss method for the first 28 patients and a permuted block minimization method for the rest 201 patients. The primary endpoint of NETTER-1 was PFS per IRC assessment and was designed with 90% power at a 2-sided alpha level of 5%. ORR and OS were major secondary measurements and test in the hierarchical order as appeared to adjust for multiplicity of the secondary endpoints. Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews)</p><p>The trial randomized 229 patients (116 to Lutathera and 113 to octreotide). Treatment with Lutathera resulted in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant treatment effect in PFS compared to treatment with octreotide LAR. The median PFS was not reached in the Lutathera arm compared to 8.5 months (95% CI: 5.8, 9.1) in the octreotide LAR arm; un-stratified HR 0.21 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.32); p-value &lt;0.0001. Treatment with Lutathera also resulted in a statistically significant improvement in ORR as assessed by the IRC compared to treatment with octreotide LAR. The ORR was 12.9% (95% CI: 7%, 19%) in the Lutathera arm and 3.5% (95% CI: 0.1%, 7%) in the octreotide LAR arm; Fisher's exact test p-value is 0.0148. The median OS for the updated analysis was not reached in the in Lutathera arm and 27.4 months (95% CI: 22.2, not evaluable) in the octreotide LAR arm, stratified HR 0.52 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.84), p-value 0.0068.</p><p>Despite the limitations in trial design and data collection in NETTER-1, a substantial, statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in both PFS and ORR were observed in this trial for Lutathera-treated patients who had histologically confirmed, advanced/inoperable or metastatic, somatostatin receptor (SSTR) positive midgut carcinoid tumors and had progressed while on octreotide LAR. Therefore, we recommend the approval of Lutathera for the treatment of patients with histologically confirmed, somatostatin receptor (SSTR) positive midgut tumors .</p><p>ERASMUS was an investigator-sponsored, open-label, single-arm, single-institution study of 1214 patients with somatostatin receptor (SSTR) positive neuroendocrine (NET) and other SSTR positive tumors. The study population was heterogeneous. The study population included 855patients with GEP-NETs and bronchial carcinoid tumors</p><p>In ERASMUS, patients were treated with a regimen similar to that used in NETTER-1 using an institutional protocol derived from the study of other high dose radiolabeled peptides. There was no formal protocol or prespecified statistical analysis plan. The primary study endpoint was investigator assessed overall response rate. There were many design issues with this study. There was no central review and confirmation of pathology, SSTR uptake at baseline or response. No baseline tumor assessments were obtained on 33% of the treated population. The flaws in the design and implementation of ERASMUS make it impossible to precisely define a response rate for patients with GEP-NETs and bronchial carcinoid tumors. However, the most conservative estimates suggest some benefit with durable responses demonstrated (and were generally consistent with effects observed in NETTER-1).</p><p>Reference ID: 4211167</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4)</formula><p>NDA/BLA Multidisciplinary Review and Evaluation NDA 207800 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate (Lutathera) 143 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety:</head><p>An assessment of the safety of Lutathera was based on an assessment of patients treated with Lutathera with octreotide LAR (30 mg IM q4 weeks) (n=111) or octreotide LAR (60 mg IM q4 weeks) (n=112) in NETTER-1. The two treatment arms were similar with respect to major demographic, tumor, and prognostic characteristics. Among patients receiving Lutathera with octreotide LAR, 79% received a cumulative dose of greater than 22.2 GBq (&gt; 600 mCi) and 76% of patients received all four planned doses. Six percent (6%) of patients required a dose reduction and 13% of patients discontinued Lutathera. Five patients discontinued due to renalrelated events, 3 patients discontinued due to hematological toxicities, and 6 discontinued for disease-or procedure-related reasons, or other reasons. The median duration of follow-up was 24 months for patients receiving Lutathera with octreotide LAR and 20 months for patients receiving octreotide LAR alone.</p><p>The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions occurring with a greater frequency (≥ 2%) among patients treated with Lutathera with octreotide LAR than octreotide LAR alone include: lymphopenia (44%), increased GGT (20%) vomiting (7%), nausea and elevated AST (5% each), increased ALT, hyperglycemia, and hypokalemia (4% each).  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="17.">Division Director (Clinical)</head><p>I recommend approval of NDA 207800, as amended, pending final agreement on labeling and post-marketing requirements.</p><p>Approval of this application is based on the results of the randomized NETTER-1 trial with support provided by the single-arm ERASMUS study. As described above, NETTER-1 was an international, open-label trial that randomly allocated 229 patients with histologically confirmed, advanced/inoperable or metastatic, somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-positive midgut carcinoid tumors that had progressed while on long-acting octreotide. The primary endpoint of NETTER-1 was PFS per IRC assessment. Two hundred and twenty-nine patients were randomized: 116 to Lutathera and 113 to the [high dose] long-acting octreotide arm. The ERASMUS study represented a single center's experience with Lutathera in the Netherlands. Lutathera in ERASMUS was initially administered in the compassionate use setting under a general umbrella peptide radiotherapy protocol and therefore was not a traditional trial with a pre-defined sample size and analysis plan. Monitoring was variable because some patients traveled to the Netherlands for treatment and then returned to their home countries outside of the Netherlands.</p><p>In NETTER-1, treatment with Lutathera resulted in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant treatment effect on PFS compared to treatment with long-acting octreotide. The median PFS was not reached in the Lutathera arm compared to 8.5 months (95% CI: 5.8, 9.1) in the long-acting octreotide arm; unstratified HR 0.21 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.32); p-value &lt; 0.0001. Although a statistically significant improvement in OS was not demonstrated (did not cross the conservative statistical boundary set for the interim analysis), the OS analysis was immature and alpha is available to test for a final OS analysis (to be tested post-approval and submitted as part of a post-approval commitment). The median OS for the updated analysis submitted within the NDA was not reached in the Lutathera arm and 27.4 months (95% CI: 22.2, not evaluable) in the long-acting octreotide arm, stratified HR 0.52 favoring the Lutathera arm (95% CI: 0.32, 0.84), nominal p-value = 0.0068.</p><p>The clinical and statistical review described certain limitations of the NETTER-1 trial. Nevertheless, approval based on this trial should be granted because of the large treatment effect that overcame these limitations. Given the large effect size (both in terms of statistical significance and in terms of the clinical relevance of the long delay in progression of the underling malignancy), a second trial should not be required to replicate this effect. Such a requirement would unnecessarily delay this effective treatment for patients with advanced or inoperable SSTR-positive neuroendocrine tumors (many of these patients also have symptomatic disease). Furthermore, the preliminary OS results appear favorable; however, the ultimate effect should be assessed as part of the pre-specified OS analysis plan.</p><p>Approval for the broader GEP-NET population is supported by the results of the NETTER-1 trial, underlying biology (indication is limited to patients with SSTR-positive tumors), and results from NDA/BLA Multidisciplinary Review and Evaluation NDA 207800 Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate (Lutathera) 160 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Condition</head><p>Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a relatively rare, clinically diverse group of epithelial malignancies that originate most commonly from the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas [gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs)]. In the U.S., an analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data indicates a rise in the age-adjusted incidence of NETs from 1.9 to 5.25 cases per 100,000 people between 1973 and 2004 1 . These tumors can arise in the setting of inherited genetic syndromes such as multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 1 and 2; however, most occur sporadically and are generally classified by site of origin, stage, ability to cause clinical symptoms and tumor differentiation.</p><p>These tumors are principally divided into those that are well-differentiated and poorlydifferentiated, with the distinction made based on the degree of cell differentiation, tumor architecture, and tumor grade. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies GEP-NETs into low-grade (G1), intermediate grade (G2), and high grade (G3) categories, based upon mitotic count, assessment for necrosis, and proliferative index or Ki-67 2 . The European Neuroendocrine Tumour Society (ENETS) stratifies tumors by grade and stage, <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4</ref> and both organizations combine grading with staging using the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) system. GEP-NETs are also described by the tissue of origin with tumors of the lung, thymus, stomach, duodenum and pancreas considered foregut tumors; tumors of the ileum, cecum and proximal colon are midgut tumors, and tumors of the distal colon and rectum are hindgut tumors.</p><p>GEP-NETs may be further characterized as functional or non-functional, depending on whether or not they secrete peptide hormones that result in clinical symptoms. Functional GEP-NETs are generally well-differentiated, and these tumors are codified to reflect the hypersecreted hormone (e.g. insulinoma, gastrinoma). The most commonly produced hormone is serotonin, which results in "carcinoid syndrome" that is characterized by flushing and diarrhea. The clinical symptoms associated with functional tumors frequently lead to their diagnosis at an earlier stage compared with non-functional tumors that often present with symptoms related to mass effect or metastatic disease. The majority of well-differentiated GEP-NETs express somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) and can be imaged using a radiolabeled form of the somatostatin analog octreotide (e.g. 111-In pentetreotide). Treatment of functional GEP-NETs requires management of clinical symptoms in addition to anti-cancer therapy.</p><p>The natural history of GEP-NET varies considerably and appears to be affected by the primary site of disease, degree of differentiation, expression of SSTRs and presence of metastases at diagnosis. Tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas have similar histologic appearances, but pancreatic NETs (pNET) tend to have a more aggressive course, albeit with higher responses to systemic therapy. The approach to initial treatment of GEP-NET consists of wide surgical resection for limited or locally advanced disease, if feasible, and treatment of NDA 208700 Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation Lutathera ( 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate) <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">20</ref> Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) hormone-related symptoms. For asymptomatic patients with slow progression, observation with routine surveillance imaging is an option, while somatostatin analogs (SSAs) such as octreotide are used for patients with hormone-related symptoms. Although SSAs were primarily used to manage the hormonal symptoms related to NETs, in vitro studies demonstrated the potential for SSAs to exert anti-proliferative activity and clinical studies have demonstrated prolonged PFS in patients with NETs treated with octreotide and lanreotide.</p><p>The prognosis for patients with metastatic well-differentiated GEP-NETs is highly variable. Based on retrospective analyses of large databases, the median OS for patients with metastatic pancreatic NETs has been reported to range from 2-5.8 years 1,5 while the median OS for small bowel NET has been reported as 7.9 years 6 .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Somatostatin Analogs (SSAs):</head><p>Although SSAs are primarily used to manage the hormonal symptoms related to NETs, in vitro studies demonstrated the potential for SSAs to exert anti-proliferative activity and clinical studies have demonstrated prolonged PFS in patients with NETs treated with octreotide and lanreotide. SSAs exert their effects through binding to SSTRs and the presence of these receptors, determined using radionuclide scintigraphy, is generally predictive of response to these agents. Octreotide may be administered as a short acting formulation or longer active depot formulation. Octreotide is approved for the symptomatic treatment of patients with GEP-NETs. Lanreotide is another long-acting depot formulation that is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with unresectable, well-or moderately-differentiated, locally advanced or metastatic GEP-NETs, to improve progression-free survival.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of Presubmission/Submission Regulatory Activity</head><p>• March 8, 2011: A pre-IND parallel scientific advice meeting was held with FDA and EMA to discuss the acceptability of a proposed trial comparing the ORR observed in patients with inoperable midgut carcinoid tumors who experienced progressive disease while being treated with octreotide LAR randomized to 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate with those randomized to Sandostatin LAR Depot. FDA stated that while the subpopulation of midgut carcinoid tumors was an acceptable population for study, given the biological and clinical heterogeneity of GEP-NETs, it would be unlikely that an indication for the treatment of somatostatin receptor positive GEP-NETs would be granted based upon data derived from the proposed trial.</p><p>• April 23, 2012: The IND-enabling study (NETTER-1) was submitted to IND 77219.</p><p>• September 3, 2014: FDA acknowledged change in the sponsorship of IND 77219 from Biosynthema to AAA.</p><p>• October 22, 2014: AAA informed FDA of the DSMB recommendation to stop enrolment and cross over all patients to the Lutathera arm due to observed PFS benefit.

The following key issues were discussed at this meeting:</p><p>o A potential broader indication for patients with GEP-NET would require demonstration of a clinically meaningful anti-tumor effect (i.e. ORR by RECIST) as determined by independent review that is of sufficient magnitude and duration to be likely to predict clinical benefit and demonstrate an advance over available therapy in an adequate number of patients with progressive and inoperable bronchial NET or pancreatic NET treated with 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate at the dose and schedule employed in the NETTER-1 study, in one or more adequate and well-controlled trials. o The adequacy of the data from the EMC study to support the broader indication cannot be determined until the data is reviewed at the time of the NDA submission. o Possible approaches to developing an expanded access program were discussed.</p><p>• November 24, 2015: A pre-NDA meeting was scheduled. The pre-meeting package did not include completed analysis of safety data from NETTER-1; therefore, it was determined there was insufficient information to reach agreement on the content of an NDA under the PDUFA V program. The following key issues were discussed at the meeting:</p><p>o FDA reiterated that a potential indication for patients with GEP-NET will require demonstration of a clinically meaningful anti-tumor effect as described above. o FDA requested additional information on the results of the EMC trial. o FDA did not object to AAA's proposal to open an expanded access trial at NETTER-1 study sites and to allow patients in the NETTER-1 study who progress during treatment with Sandostatin LAR 60 mg to receive 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate. o FDA discouraged AAA from submitting the interim analysis of OS as the final analysis in the NDA and encouraged AAA to conduct additional analyses at later time points when a greater number of events have occurred. FDA emphasized that for the OS results to be included in the label, an effect on OS must meet the criteria for substantial evidence of efficacy.</p><p>• March 14, 2016: A pre-NDA meeting was held with FDA to discuss the submission of the NDA.</p><p>• April 28, 2016: The NDA rolling submission was completed.

Limited nonclinical studies were conducted with 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate. Instead, many nonclinical studies were conducted using 175 Lu-DOTA 0 -TYR 3 -Octreotate. As the only difference between the 177 Lu and 175 Lu is the radiolabel, the use of the cold construct is applicable for evaluating the non-radioactivity-mediated toxicity of the intended clinical product. In addition, the Applicant submitted pharmacology studies using 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate to help support the activity of the drug in the intended patient population.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">(b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4)</formula><p>Somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) is commonly over-expressed in neuroendocrine tumors. In vitro binding data showed that DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate has high affinity for somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) compared to somatostatin receptors 1, 3, 4, and 5, blocking binding of somatostatin to SSTR2 with an IC 50 of 0.98 nM. The Applicant also demonstrated cellular internalization of the construct following binding using an SSTR2-expressing pancreatic tumor cell line. In a series of in vivo studies examining the anti-tumor activity of 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate in pancreatic tumor implanted male Lewis rats, the Applicant demonstrated that repeated treatment with the construct resulted in SSTR2-dependent tumor regression at radioactive doses ≥ 2.5 mCi (approximately 92 MBq), but that long-term survival of effectively treated animals was impacted by renal damage characterized by increased creatinine and urinary protein levels as well as histopathological lesions. Administration of lysine along with 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate offered a limited degree of kidney protection in these studies. Longer dosing intervals also resulted in an improvement in renal damage scores.</p><p>Safety pharmacology and toxicology studies submitted to support the safety of 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate were reviewed in depth by Dr. Ronald Honchel under NDA 208547. In vivo animal studies demonstrated high uptake of the radiolabeled peptide in the pancreas (high SSTR2 expressing organ). This finding correlated with observations of pancreatic acinar apoptosis at doses ≥ 5 mg/kg of 175 Lu-DOTA 0 -TYR3-Octreoate in repeat dose toxicology studies in rats. Pancreatic acinar cell atrophy also occurred in repeat dose toxicology studies in dogs at doses ≥ 500 mg/kg. There were no other significant test-article related findings in the general toxicology studies of 175 Lutetium-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate given by intravenous injection in either species. High levels of 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate were also present in both the bone and kidney. Distribution to the kidney, the main excretory organ for the peptide, was consistent with findings of long term renal damage in tumor implantation experiments. Renal damage is a common acute and long term toxicity associated with administration of 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate clinically as well. Hematological toxicity is also a major clinical toxicity.</p><p>NDA 208700 Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation Lutathera ( 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate)</p></div>

Further support for the cardiovascular safety of the cold compound included its lack of effect on ECG parameters in the repeat dose toxicology study in dogs at single doses up to 3.2 mg/kg and an IC 50 of &gt; 100 μM in the in vitro hERG assay, though mild dose-independent effects (≤ 22% increases) on systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure with concomitant decreases in heart rate did occur at doses as low as 40 μg/kg. At the highest dose of 20 mg/kg 175 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate acted as a respiratory stimulant (increased respiratory rate, peak inspiratory and peak expiratory flows, inspiration and expiration times and minute volume).

The cold product, 175 Lutetium-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate, was non-mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay and negative in mouse lymphoma cells in vitro. As 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate is a radioactive product, it is considered to be genotoxic. Consistent with the ICH S9 Guidance, because 177 Lutetium-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate is a genotoxic drug, no reproductive toxicology studies were conducted or required to support the registration of the drug. The risk of radiopharmaceuticals to a developing fetus is well-established in the scientific literature.

The DOTA-TYR 3 -Octreotate construct inhibited binding to the cell membranes at IC 50 s below those determined for some other somatostatin analogs, including the approved somatostatin OctreoScan product. The Applicant investigated the internalization of labelled-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate using somatostatin receptor (SST2R) expressing rat pancreatic ascinar tumor cells (AR42J) (Study 20000420). Cells were maintained in F-12K medium and incubated at 37°C in triplicate with approximately 0.5 nM (0.1 to 0.25 μCi) of radiolabeled peptide for 4 hours, after which cellular uptake was terminated by removing medium from the cells and washing wells with 2 ml of PBS. The combined wash and media was counted to determine free activity at 4 hours. Fresh media was added to the cells and incubation was continued. At 16 hours the wash cycle was repeated and the remaining cells were scrapped into PBS for determination of retained activity.

The original method failed to show selectivity, accuracy, precision, and recovery as it did not include the following information: standards with known amount of analyte, determination of the upper and lower limits of quantitation, replicate measures, assessment of sample stability, and incurred sample reanalysis.</p><p>An additional HPLC method validation report is provided to support the identification of urine metabolites of 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate. The HPLC method validation report is deficient due to the lack of internal standard while processing and analyzing the samples. This issue was communicated to the applicant during pre-NDA meeting on October 25, 2016. The Applicant acknowledged the concerns of the FDA and agreed to improve the HPLC method by including a cold reference standard of Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreoate and minimizing variability in the chromatographic retention of 177 Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreoate. The applicant stated that they will use the improved assay method to analyze the urine samples from the 8 remaining patients and asked the FDA if this data would be sufficient to fulfill the commitment made during the Type C meeting on August 27, 2015. In the NDA submission, the Applicant provided only a System Suitability Test (SST) on samples obtained for the last three patients (US11-025, US11-031 and US11-029). The SST only included cold reference sample before and after the run for each patient and did not include spiked internal standard as requested.</p><p>The methods for whole body and organ radiation dosimetry of 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate are reported in Dosimetry reports for both Erasmus and Netter-1 studies. Radiation dosimetry was used to determine the dose to critical organs (e.g., kidney and bone marrow). In addition, full body (planar) and 3D SPECT scans were performed on the day of the 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate administration.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Is the proposed dosing regimen appropriate for the general patient population for which the indication is being sought?</head><p>The dosing regimen for 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate was based on safety and dosimetry data from a single dose escalation part in the Erasmus Phase 1/2 study which resulted in a cumulative dose that remained below the defined radiation toxicity threshold to the kidney (23 Gy) and bone marrow (2 Gy).</p><p>Due to the study data deficiencies, the FDA is not able to determine the appropriateness of the proposed dosing regimen from a clinical pharmacology perspective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Is an alternative dosing regimen or management strategy required for subpopulations based on intrinsic patient factors?</head><p>No alterative dosing regimen is proposed in the application. Per the Applicant, no correlations were found when comparing the following:</p><p>• Radiation dose absorbed to the bone marrow and neither acute or long term hematological toxicities. • Long-term bone marrow toxicity normalized to dose (administered radioactivity) vs body weight or body surface area (BSA). • Kidney dose and long-term kidney toxicity by creatinine clearance loss.</p><p>• Long-term radiation induced kidney toxicity normalized to dose (administered radioactivity) vs body weight or BSA.</p><p>Due to the study data deficiencies, the FDA is not able to determine if an altered dosing regimen or management strategy is required for patients with renal impairment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Are there clinically relevant food-drug or drug-drug interactions, and what is the appropriate management strategy?</head><p>The Applicant reported that no significant inhibitory or induction effect on human CYP450 enzymes and P-gp specific interactions were seen suggesting that there is little potential for 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate to mediate clinically relevant drug-drug interactions. Concomitant infusion of amino acids 30 minutes before the start of infusion of 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate and continuation at a constant rate for at least hours is required for renal protection.</p><p>These conclusions could not be verified, due to the study data deficiencies, the FDA is not able to determine the potential for drug-drug interactions or the contribution of amino acids in the disposition of 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_121">Table 7</ref> lists the clinical trials included in this NDA submission.</p><p>The primary evidence to support the clinical safety and efficacy of 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate in patients with SSTR positive midgut GEP-NETs is from Trial AAA-III-01, hereafter referred to as NETTER-1.</p><p>A sub-study of NETTER-1 was conducted in 20 patients who received 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate at selected sites to evaluate dosimetry, PK and 24-hour holter cardiac monitoring. These patients were not randomized and the patients enrolled in the substudy were not considered in the primary or in the secondary analysis of the main study groups. A nonrandomized cohort of patients receiving investigational treatments ( 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate) was temporarily activated at all sites participating in the sub-study until a total of twenty (20) patients were enrolled. All patients included in the sub-study were treated as per the investigational treatment arm (4 infusions of 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate +30 mg Octreotide LAR). During this period, the sites not participating in the sub-study continued to enroll patients using the randomization protocol of the main study.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data and Analysis Quality</head><p>During this NDA review, significant issues were uncovered regarding the quality and integrity of the submitted data. A brief timeline of events is provided below:</p><p>• June 17, 2016: Applicant orientation meeting held, including application "walk-through."</p><p>• June 9 -July 18, 2016: Multiple information requests (IRs) were sent to AAA from the clinical, statistical, clinical pharmacology and OSI review teams. The IRs were mainly related to missing and inconsistent data in the datasets, missing statistical programs required for FDA to verify data derivation from raw data to run analyses, and inadequate define files. Due to these deficiencies, FDA was not able to confirm the safety and efficacy data submitted in the CSR.</p><p>• June 30, 2016: During a teleconference, FDA informed AAA that the clinical and statistical review teams were not able to generate or confirm the tables and data provided in the NETTER-1 CSR based on the datasets submitted. In addition, AAA stated the data in the CSR were generated by the CRO based on legacy data and differed from the CDISC data that was submitted to FDA for review. AAA stated they were not able to convert the data to be CDISC compliant, and instead mapped the legacy raw and derived datasets into CDISC SDTM/ADaM for submission to FDA. It was not clear what programs AAA used to convert the raw data. FDA informed AAA that it is not acceptable that the data used to derive tables and information in the CSR differ from the data submitted to FDA.</p><p>• August 2, 2016: A post mid-cycle teleconference was held and AAA was informed that the clinical, statistical and clinical pharmacology review teams have determined the application is materially incomplete in that the datasets provided are inaccurate, incomplete, and inconsistent. Thus, FDA cannot verify the information provided in the • August 25, 2016: AAA submitted "test" datasets for FDA to review. FDA was not able to open the datasets in JMP and informed AAA that this appeared to be related to the file name used. AAA re-submitted "test" datasets in a revised format that was deemed acceptable.</p><p>• October 10, 2016: AAA submitted the datasets as agreed upon during the August 2, 2016, teleconference; however, FDA reviewers were not able to access the datasets and continued to have problems with the data format and missing data.</p><p>In summary , the quality of the original data submission and more than 10 data resubmissions were not adequate for FDA reviewers to review the application after more than 15 formal data quality-related information requests were sent to the applicant to request additional data, documentations, programs, and results, and face-to-face meeting, teleconference, and email communications with AAA. The reviewers observed key data related issues as detailed below: • The study data contained in the electronic submissions failed to be in a format that FDA can process, review, and archive (FDA Guidance for Industry Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format-Standardized Study Data). Currently, FDA can process, review, and archive electronic submissions of clinical and nonclinical study data that use the standards specified in the FDA's Data Standards Catalog.</p><p>a.

Progressive disease based on RECIST Criteria, Version 1.1 while receiving an uninterrupted fixed dose of Octreotide LAR (20-30 mg/3-4 weeks). Disease progression must be centrally confirmed. In order to make the assessment, two CT (or MRI) scans are required; the oldest scan must not be older than 3 years from the date of randomization and the most recent scan must not be older than 4 weeks from the date of randomization.

Acceptable if the oldest scan is obtained within 12 weeks of the patient receiving a fixed dose regimen of Octreotide LAR (20-30 mg/3-4 weeks); b. Acceptable for either scan to be obtained before or during the time a patient receiving a fixed dose of Octreotide LAR has switched to an equivalent dose of short acting Octreotide for up to 6 weeks in order to obtain an OctreoScan, provided the patient returns to the Octreotide LAR fixed dose after the OctreoScan has been obtained. 6. Confirmed presence of somatostatin receptors on all target lesions documented by CT/MRI scans, based on positive OctreoScan imaging within 24 weeks prior to randomization in the study (to be centrally confirmed). The OctreoScan should be one that was performed while the patient was on a fixed dose of Sandostatin LAR.

Per amended actual censoring rules for primary PFS analysis, under SN21 (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_121">Table 7</ref>), AAA did not follow SAP pre-specified censoring rules. In the future NDA submission, AAA should provide the following information as listed below in the primary PFS analysis:</p><p>• AAA used a 210-day gap as the threshold to calculate the flag of two continuous missing tumor assessments. FDA recommends that AAA use 175 [(12*2+1)*7] days instead. Using a 210-day threshold, only four patients were reported to be censored due to 2 continuous missing assessments. Due to the data deficiencies, FDA could not identify the actual number of patients who were censored in the range of 175-210 days. • A sensitivity analysis with the observation censored on the date of last adequate tumor assessment for patients: o Who are alive, on study, and progression-free at the time of the analysis; o Who are given/change anti-cancer therapy other than the study treatment prior to observing progression, and NDA 208700 Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation Lutathera ( 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate) 59 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) o Who discontinue (due to personal preference or toxicity), withdraw, or are lost to follow-up. • AAA should use consistent algorithm to calculate time to event duration. Conventionally, FDA calculates time to event date as (event date -randomization date + 1).</p><p>FDA could not evaluate the derivation of PFS data. Hence, FDA is uncertain about the definition for centrally confirmed PFS per IRC assessment. Per RECIST 1.1, disease progression does not need to be confirmed. Step down adjusted Cox's proportional hazards model was planned in the SAP. In the CSR, AAA also reported below PFS sensitivity analyses: o Per INV assessment in the ITT and PPS. o Per IRC assessment in the PPS. o Assigning the event time to the next scheduled image time. o Ignoring early censoring because of new anti-cancer treatments started before progressive disease or death. o Ignoring early censoring because of more than 2 missing consecutive visits. o Ignoring both early censoring because of more than 2 missing consecutive visits and early censoring because of new anti-cancer treatments started before progressive disease or death.</p><p>NDA 208700 Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation Lutathera ( 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate) 60 Version date: February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) ORR The analysis for ORR would be treatment arms compared using the Fisher exact test.</p></div>

FDA clinical, statistical, and clinical pharmacology reviewers were unable to confirm or assess the clinical effects of 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate because the datasets were not sufficiently executable for review and because certain datasets contained missing variables, data (e.g., unique subject ID numbers, tumor measurements, laboratory values, exposure data) or inconsistencies. Certain data elements also did not correspond to values in the CRFs or contained apparent errors (e.g., laboratory test values); therefore, the datasets cannot be considered accurate and complete as described in 21 CFR 11.10(b). As such, the complete response letter will be sent based on the reason described in 21 CFR 314.125(b)(4): There is insufficient information about the drug to determine whether the product is safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its proposed labeling.</p><p>Furthermore, I concur with the review teams' recommendation to issue a complete response letter for 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate based on objectionable conditions observed during inspections of manufacturing facilities in Italy and the Netherlands. The complete response action is based on the reason described in 21 CFR 314.125(b)(1): The methods to be used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of the drug substance or the drug product are inadequate to preserve its identity, strength, quality, purity, stability, and bioavailability. 21 CFR 314.110 states that if FDA determines, after an application is filed or an abbreviated application is received, that the data submitted are inadequate to support approval, the Agency might issue a complete response letter without first conducting required inspections and/or reviewing proposed product labeling. FDA review staff did not complete review of product labeling because the data could not be confirmed; however, FDA completed required inspections necessary to take action on this application.</p><p>If the Applicant's results are confirmed following resubmission, I believe that this application is potentially approvable if FDA reviewers concur that a statistically significant and clinically meaningful effect on progression free survival has been demonstrated and this effect is supported by an overall favorable risk-benefit determination.</p><p>AAA publically stated (http://www.adacap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016-11-28-PR-AAA-3Q16-Financials-ENG-FINAL.pdf) that they are planning to extend the expanded access program in the United States in order to facilitate access to 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate prior to resolving the deficiencies in the complete response letter.

Most patients had gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NET)-foregut, midgut and hindgut carcinoids of the digestive tract, the bronchus, and all types of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNET). However, other NETs were also included (medullary thyroid cancer, pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, neuroblastoma and Merkel cell carcinoma). Additionally, non-NET SSRT positive tumors (melanoma, non-differentiated thyroid cancers, non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, lymphoma, and malignant meningioma) were also included.</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">Sample Size (Censored/ Events)</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Lutathera +</cell><cell>Octreotide LAR</cell><cell>Un-stratified HR</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Octreotide LAR (30 mg)</cell><cell>(60 mg)</cell><cell>(95% CI)</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>N=116</cell><cell>N=113</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Overall</cell><cell></cell><cell>89/27</cell><cell>35/78</cell><cell>0.21 (0.13, 0.32)</cell></row><row><cell>Age:</cell><cell>&lt;=65</cell><cell>47/ 14</cell><cell>21/ 35</cell><cell>0.23 (0.12, 0.42)</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>&gt;65</cell><cell>42/ 13</cell><cell>14/ 43</cell><cell>0.20 (0.11, 0.37)</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Gender: Female</cell><cell>43/ 10</cell><cell>19/ 41</cell><cell>0.16 (0.08, 0.33)</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Male</cell><cell>46/ 17</cell><cell>16/ 37</cell><cell>0.24 (0.13, 0.43)</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

The Modified Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) criteria was used in the assessment of patients enrolled prior toMarch 15,  2007. After this date, patients were assessed using RECIST criteria. To provide parity with the NETTER-1 trial, based on recorded lesion diameters, assessments were retrospectively reclassified to RECIST 1.1 criteria using a SAS program which calculated the sum of the longest diameter of each target lesion and accounted for the development of new lesions.There were study design limitations in the version of the statistical analysis plan dated November 18, 2008. FDA's concerns were discussed with AAA during the Pre-IND and Pre-NDA meetings. A revised SAP dated November 30, 2015, for ERASMUS was submitted in the NDA resubmission. This review reported the results/analyses per the SAP in cases where discordance existed between the protocol and SAP; the SAP reflected the applicant's most recent analysis strategy. Because time-to-event analyses and patient reported outcomes are not interpretable in single arm trials, the focus of the FDA efficacy assessment was the primary endpoint of response rate and duration of response. Evaluate the progression free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP) and Overall survival (OS) in patients with SSTR positive tumors. • Assess the effect of treatment with 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate on Quality of Life (QoL) as measured with the EORTC QLQC30 questionnaire and in patients enrolled in 2012 and later, the EORTC QLQC30 as well as the EOTC-QLQ-GI.NET21 questionnaire.

Patients in whom short-acting somatostatin analogues could not be interrupted for 12 hours before and 12 hours after administration of 177 Lu-DOTA Patients in the initial biodistribution and dosimetry study and in the ascending dose study may have received less than the full dose due to lower initial starting doses. 2. Patients who experienced dose limiting toxicity (DLT) may have received a dose reduction and/or discontinuation. 3. Patients may not have received the full fourth dose if the kidney dosimetry data based on planar images obtained after the first administration of 7.4 GBq 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate indicated that the patient would exceed the 23 Gy kidney threshold dose limit. 4.

FDA Data Standards Catalog states that FDA only accepts XPT, PDF, XML exchange format. The submitted database in SAS7bdata format was inadequate and is not ready for XPT transformation. The SAS7bdat data should follow the requirements as listed below to be able to transform to XPORT files: i. Dataset greater than 5 GB in size should be split in the smaller dataset no larger than 5 GB. ii. To reduce file size, the allotted length for each variable should be set to the maximum length of variable used across entire submission. iii. One data per transport file with the same name (e.g. ae.sas7bdat and ae.xpt). iv. Maximum length in characters for data and variable name is 8. v. Maximum length in characters for data and variable label is 40. i. Use American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) text codes.Furthermore, Ms. Joy Li from FDA's Computational Science Center point out that the encoding system used by AAA to generate the datasets (utf-8 Unicode) results in reading errors; therefore, utilize the default SAS coding system,wlatin1 (i.e. western world encoding). vi. Exclude punctuation, dashed, space, non-alphanumerical symbols, and special characters. vii. Exclude user-defined SAS format library. Instead, AAA may provide this information in the Controlled Terminologies.c. Each patient should be assigned to a single unique subject identifier (USUBJID) across the entire submission. Subject Identifier (SUBJID) should be different if screened more than once in a trial (e.g. SUBJID 002 in SITEID IT06 was moved to another site. Due to duplicate SUBJID 002 in multiple sites without reported USUBJID, FDA could not trace this patient's record).• FDA has determined that the study data submitted could not provide sufficient information to understand the accuracy of the data (i.e., traceability of the AAA's analysis results back to the annotated CRF (aCRF). Traceability permits an understanding of the relationships between the analysis results (tables, listings and figures (TLFs) in the CSR, analysis datasets, tabulation datasets, and source data (See FDA's Study Data Technical Conformance Guide: Technical Specifications Document). a. In the original submission, the data used to generate the CSR and TLFs differ from the data submitted to FDA for review (as reported in the T-con on June 30, 2015). b. Under the most recent submission in SN 33 dated on October 13, 2016, the datasets submitted contain errors and are incomplete. The entire study data submission renders the application unreviewable, administratively incomplete, and inconsistent with regulatory requirements. AAA should ensure that the raw data used to generate these datasets have been audited for completeness, missing data points and errors, up to the time of database lock. GB in size.iii. The lengths for data and variable name, data and variable label in the submitted sas7dbat files exceeded max length requirement to be ready for XPT transformation. iv. Provided many system generated variables which were not used for analysis purpose. v. Provided many data with user defined SAS format library, which caused difficulty to understand submitted study data. vi. Provided 201 out of 229 randomized patient's scheme with many missing values in essential variables. It appears that the stratification factors were documented per CRF instead of IVRS database. vii. Modified legacy raw dataset post clinical data cut-off. For example, the DM information was last modified on November 14, 2015. The most recent tumor evaluation was modified on September 23, 2016. viii. Tumor assessments were provided in multiple datasets with many missing values in essential variables and lack of adequate documentations. FDA has difficulty understanding submitted tumor assessment related datasets. ix.In the PFS primary analysis dataset, age, race, gender, stratification factors, and important disease characteristics variables were not included. Further data February 1, 2016 for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) manipulation is needed to conduct mandatory subgroup analyses by age, race, and gender. x.Many mistakes were identified in the submitted data. For example, some lab tests are out of range. Furthermore, some lab test value did not have measurement unit to help FDA to understand the meaning of the value.aCRF xi. AAA failed to map variables on the aCRF to the corresponding variables in the datasets.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.">Postmarketing Requirements and Commitment</head><p>The following post marketing requirements (PMRs) under 505(o) are recommended:</p><p>Submit cumulative, integrated safety analyses after 5 and after 10 years of follow-up of patients from an adequate number of clinical trials to identify and characterize the risk of renal failure with Lutathera; include incidence rates, time to onset, predisposing factors, and outcomes. These safety evaluations should be adequate to inform labeling of patient populations at highest risk and to provide evidence-based dose modifications and monitoring recommendations.</p></div>

Submit cumulative, integrated safety analyses after 5 and after 10 years of follow-up of patients from an adequate number of clinical trials to identify and characterize the risks of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute leukemia with Lutathera; include incidence rates, time to onset, predisposing factors, and outcomes.

The OS analysis of NETTER-1 was considered immature (see Efficacy Section above) and therefore the review team is recommending that AAA provide the final results of the OS analysis. Furthermore, if the pre-specified analysis is statistically significant, the potential exists for the sponsor to make a labeling claim for OS.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Size Considerations</head><p>The primary endpoint was PFS as assessed by IRC according to RECIST 1.1 and was centrally confirmed. Assuming that the median PFS was 14 months in the control arm and 30 months in the experimental arm, a total of 74 centrally confirmed PFS events per IRC assessment were needed to detect a hazard ratio of 0.47 with 90% power at a 2-sided alpha level of 5%.</p><p>The trial was also designed to test OS. Assuming that the median OS was 32 months in the control arm and 50 months in the experimental arm, a total of 158 death events were needed to detect a hazard ratio of 0.64 with 80% power at a 1-sided alpha level of 2.5%. An interim analysis was planned at the final PFS analysis. Per SAP V1, the OBF boundary method was used with respective alpha allocation of 0.0085% for the OS interim analysis. Based on a lack of number of projected OS events at the interim analysis, the meaning of 0.0085% is unclear.</p><p>Major secondary endpoints include OS and ORR. A hierarchical procedure was proposed to adjust for multiplicity in testing the secondary endpoints in the order of ORR and OS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis sets</head><p>The primary efficacy analysis population was the ITT population, which included all randomized patients who received any amount of study drug. Patients would be categorized by the treatment arm to which they were assigned at randomization, regardless of the actual treatment received. The ITT population was named as Full Analysis Set in the SAP and protocol.</p><p>The PPS included all randomized patients, who had no major protocol violations.</p><p>The SAF included all randomized patients who received any amount of study drug. Analysis of safety data would be performed according to the actual treatment a patient has received.</p><p>The ITT was used for all analyses of efficacy, demographics and baseline characteristics. The PPS was used for the sensitivity efficacy analyses. The safety set was used for all safety analyses.</p><p>NDA 208700 Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation Lutathera ( 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate)</p></div>

Eighty-seven (87) patients who were screen failures and an additional twenty-five (25 patients) who consented to the sub-study were excluded from the Full Analysis Set (FAS). FDA reviewers were not able to confirm patient disposition as described by the Applicant in the CSR, due to the data deficiencies described above.</p></div>
