<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Executive Summary Section dorzolamide 2% to timolol GFS in response to this written request. The primary objective of the written request and submitted trial was to obtain data on the safety and clinical response of dorzolamide 2% in the pediatric population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Efficacy</head><p>The clinical response data contained in this supplement demonstrates that dorzolamide 2% effectively lowers IOP in the pediatric population. IOP is lowered approximately 7-9mmHg in this population with a baseline IOP of approximately 30 mmHg.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Safety</head><p>Dorzolamide 2% is safe for use in the pediatric population below the age of 6 years old. Overall, less than 2.5% of patients in the dorzolamide 2% treatment group discontinued from the study due to an adverse event. The safety profile of dorzolamide is similar to that seen in adults. The types of adverse events seen are those commonly expected with topical ophthalmic medications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Dosing</head><p>Dosing for this pediatric trial was based on the currently labeled dosing frequency for adult patients. No further dose ranging was warranted. The currently labeled dosing level and frequency is safe in the pediatric population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Special Populations</head><p>The sponsor has adequately addressed the safety and clinical response of this drug product in two age cohorts The two age cohorts analyzed were: "patients &lt; 2 years old" and "patients ≥ 2 years but &lt;6 years old". The effects of gender, race, age and iris color were analyzed during the review of the original NDA. Gender effects were not analyzed in this pediatric supplement because the study population is not large enough to perform this analysis and no effects were found in the original NDA submission. There is no additional data needed in other populations for this drug product. Safety and efficacy have been adequately characterized in the target populations. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Review</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Introduction and Background</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. State of Armamentarium for Indication(s)</head><p>Dorzolamide HCL was approved in 1994 as the first topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor for the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with ocular hypertension or glaucoma. To date the safety and effectiveness of this product has not been established in the pediatric population.</p><p>Currently, the only approved drug for the treatment of elevated IOP in the pediatric population is brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution. This drug product is labeled for pediatric patients over the age of 2 years old.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Important Milestones in Product Development</head><p>Milestones leading up to this pediatric efficacy supplement submission:</p><p>12/9/94 -Original NDA approved 6/24/99 -Original pediatric written request issued by the Agency 5/19/00 -Amended written request issued to revise the age group enrollment criteria.</p><p>Clinical Review Section 2/12/02 -Amended written request issued to revise the timeframe for submission of pediatric studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Other Relevant Information</head><p>As of July 7, 2003, dorzolamide HCL has received marketing approval for the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma in approximately 69 countries. This product has not been withdrawn from the market in any country as of this date.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Important Issues with Pharmacologically Related Agents</head><p>There are no safety concerns associated with other topical ophthalmic agents in this pharmacologic class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. Clinically Relevant Findings From Chemistry, Animal Pharmacology and Toxicology, Microbiology, Biopharmaceutics, Statistics and/or Other Consultant Reviews</head><p>There were no new consultant reviews required for this efficacy supplement. Full reviews for all disciplines were completed during the review of the original NDA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. Human Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Pharmacokinetics</head><p>A full pharmacokinetics review was completed for this product in the original NDA review. No new pharmacokinetic data is contained in this pediatric supplement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Pharmacodynamics</head><p>No new pharmacodynamic data is contained in this pediatric supplement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. Description of Clinical Data and Sources</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Overall Data</head><p>This pediatric supplement includes one study (P1001C1) that was conducted at 22 U.S. sites and 13 international sites. This material is contained in NDA 20 408/SE5-033 Volume 1. The materials were submitted in hard copy and electronic formats. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Tables Listing the Clinical Trials</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Postmarketing Experience</head><p>The existing postmarketing data available in the adult population has been reviewed by the division. The events reported are consistent with the events reported in the clinical study included in this efficacy supplement.</p><p>The sponsor searched their own Worldwide Adverse Experience System (WAES) database for reports of adverse experiences with dorzolamide hydrochloride in patients aged &lt;6 years of age. A total of 8 reports were identified. There were 3 reports of local nonserious adverse experiences; skin irritation, ocular burning and corneal clouding. The corneal clouding resolved with the discontinuation of dorzolamide and did not reappear when dorzolamide was restarted.</p><p>Two (2) reports described serious adverse experiences that persisted after dorzolamide was discontinued (metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis).</p><p>Two (2) cases of presumed dorzolamide overdose were received. One patient developed somnolence that resolved within hours. In another patient, rash, red eye, and dehydration occurred after 8 days of treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Literature Review</head><p>The sponsor has reviewed the medical literature for adverse events in patients under the age of six. One report of lethargy, hypotension, and hypothermia in a 4 week old patient was published in the medical literature. The patient was taking dorzolamide, betaxolol and brimonidine drops. This report attributed the adverse events to the use of brimonidine tartrate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. Clinical Review Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. How the Review was Conducted</head><p>The primary objective of this review was to determine the safety profile of dorzolamide HCL in the pediatric population. Clinical response data was also analyzed; however, the division believes that efficacy for this drug product can be reliably extrapolated from the adult population. Safety was assessed by evaluating the adverse event profile, discontinuation data and the drug specific safety concerns addressed in the pediatric written request. This included vital signs, pulse, blood pressure, alertness, intraocular pressure, visual acuity, dilated ophthalmoscopy and corneal diameter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Overview of Materials Consulted in Review</head><p>This review was based on the review of a single trial (P100C1) submitted by the sponsor in both paper and electronic format.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Overview of Methods Used to Evaluate Data Quality and Integrity</head><p>DSI audits were not conducted for this efficacy supplement. The data was reviewed internally for consistency with other safety and efficacy data available for this drug product.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Were Trials Conducted in Accordance with Accepted Ethical Standards</head><p>There is no evidence to indicate that this trial was not conducted in accordance with accepted ethical standards. The sponsor attests that the study was conducted in conformance with applicable country or local requirements regarding ethical committee review, informed consent, and other statutes or regulations regarding the protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects participating in biomedical research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Review Section</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Evaluation of Financial Disclosure</head><p>The sponsor has certified that they have not entered into any financial arrangement with the clinical investigators of this trial whereby the value of compensation to the investigator could be affected by the outcome of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. Integrated Review of Efficacy</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Brief Statement of Conclusions</head><p>The clinical response data contained in this supplement demonstrates that dorzolamide 2% effectively lowers IOP in the pediatric population. IOP is lowered approximately 7-9mmHg in this population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. General Approach to Review of the Efficacy of the Drug</head><p>The purpose of this submission was to determine the safety profile of dorzolamide HCL in the pediatric population. It is the division's view that efficacy for this product can be reliably extrapolated from the existing adult database; therefore, this trial was not designed to establish efficacy. Clinical response data was collected and is presented below along with the study design. The primary safety endpoint for each treatment group will be the proportion of patients who discontinue therapy due to a drug-related adverse experience prior to completing 3 months of therapy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Detailed Review of Trials by Indication</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary</head><p>To characterize the IOP-lowering effect of dorzolamide 2% t.i.d., and the need for additional therapy in patients &lt;6 years of age with elevated IOP or glaucoma. To characterize the effect of dorzolamide 2% t.i.d. on total CO2 in patients &lt;6 years of age with elevated IOP or glaucoma. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comments:</head><p>The agency prefers patients to be randomized with at least ten patients per arm per center in multicenter trials so that interaction between centers can be evaluated.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Methods and Specific Findings of Safety Review</head><p>The primary objective of study P100C1 was to document an acceptable safety profile for initial therapy with dorzolamide 2% taken for up to 3 months in patients 1 week to &lt;2 years and in patients ≥ 2 years but &lt; 6 years of age. The primary measure of safety for each group was the proportion of patients who discontinued therapy due to a drug-related adverse experience prior to completing 3 months of therapy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary Safety Variable</head><p>In the age cohort &lt;2 years, 1 patient (1.79%) of 56 initially randomized to the dorzolamide 2% treatment group discontinued study therapy due to a drug-related adverse event. None of the 27 patients initially randomized to the timolol GFS 0.25% treatment group discontinued study therapy due to a drug-related adverse experience.</p><p>The drug related adverse event was experienced by a patient (AN 2049) in the dorzolamide 2% group who switched to open-label concomitant therapy (dorzolamide/timolol) on study day 8 because of inadequate IOP control. A drugrelated serious adverse experience of bradycardia was observed on study day 24. Timolol administration was discontinued for the patient on the same day that the bradycardia was noted, but the patient was continued on dorzolamide 2% monotherapy. The bradycardia resolved after 8 days, and the subject continued on dorzolamide 2% monotherapy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discontinuations Due to Adverse Experiences (Age Cohort &lt; 2 years)</head><p>Dorzolamide 2% </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Review Section</head><p>In the age cohort ≥2 years but &lt;6 years, 2 patients (3.03%) of 66 initially randomized to the dorzolamide 2% treatment group discontinued study therapy due to a drug-related adverse experience. Both of these patients discontinued due to at least one of the following adverse experiences: eye pain, ocular injection, burning/stinging eye, or eye itching associated with dorzolamide 2% monotherapy treatment. One (2.86%) of the 35 patients initially randomized to the timolol GFS 0.25% treatment group discontinued study therapy due to the drug-related adverse experience of ocular injection. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discontinuations</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's comments:</head><p>Overall, less than 2.5% of patients in the dorzolamide 2% treatment group discontinued from the study due to an adverse event compared to the discontinuation rate in the timolol GFS group of 6.5%.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comments:</head><p>There is a higher rate of adverse reactions in the dorzolamide 2% treatment group during monotherapy. This is no longer present during the concomitant therapy phase. The rates appear to be equivalent. There is a four-fold higher rate of diarrhea in the dorzolamide 2% treatment group during the monotherapy phase. This difference is no longer present during concomitant treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Monotherapy Phase</head><p>The most common clinical adverse experiences in both treatment groups were fever, cough, and upper respiratory infections. A greater proportion of patients who were randomized to dorzolamide 2% had a digestive system adverse experience compared with the timolol GFS 0.25% group (23.2% versus 7.4%). Specifically, more patients randomized to dorzolamide 2% reported diarrhea (17.9% versus 3.7%). A greater proportion of patients who were randomized to timolol GFS 0.25% had eye discharge (11.1% versus 5.4%) and eye irritation (7.4% versus 0%) compared with the dorzolamide 2% group.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comments:</head><p>There were no clinically significant changes in pulse, blood pressure or respiratory rate in either of the treatment groups for both age cohorts. There was an increase in pulse rate noted in the timolol monotherapy treatment group for age cohort &lt; 2. This is counterintuitive based on the mechanism of action of beta-blockers. This event, however, was not clinically significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Corneal Diameter</head><p>Corneal diameter measurements were obtained at baseline and at Week 12. If the patient discontinued the study prior to Week 12, the corneal diameter was to be measured at the discontinuation visit. The mean and standard deviation at baseline and Week 12, as well as the change and percent change from baseline to Week 12, are presented for the corneal diameter of the study eye. Nominal p-values were calculated on mean change and mean percent change from baseline within treatment groups based on the paired t-test. Results were determined for those who completed the study while on monotherapy, and overall. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comments:</head><p>There were no clinically significant changes in corneal diameter in either treatment group for both of the age cohorts. The mean baseline and end of study corneal diameters in this study are outside of normal limits. The values are borderline for megalocornea which is consistent with this disease process.</p></div>

The last monotherapy visit served as the point of reference (baseline) for the concomitant/combination therapy phase analysis.</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell cols="3">Clinical Review Section</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="9">Number (%) of Patients With Emergent or Worsening Ocular Symptoms (Incidence &gt; 0 % in One or More Treatment Groups) (Age Cohort ≥ 2 Years but &lt; 6 Years) Masked Monotherapy Phase Open-label Concomitant Therapy Phase Dorzolamide 2%/Timolol GFS 0.5% (N=30) Mean Change (SD) Measurement Treatment Mean (SD) (Unit) N Baseline Treatment Change % Change Systolic BP (mm Hg) Dorzolamide 2% 53 102.5 (21.16) 101.4 (17.83) -1.1 (21.26) 2.2 (24.72) Timolol GFS 26 108.8 (20.30) 109.2 (19.55) 0.3 (15.42) 1.3 (12.74) Mean Change (SD) Measurement (Unit) Treatment Mean (SD) N Baseline Treatment Change % Change Systolic BP (mm Hg) Dorzolamide 2% 64 109.6 (17.76) 110.3 (14.33) 0.7 (17.81) 2.8 (19.79) Timolol GFS 35 107.4 (14.28) 104.5 (14.50) -2.9 (13.32) -1.9 (12.46) dorzolamide 2% monotherapyMean Change (SD) in Total CO 2 (mmol/L) to the Last Observation in Treatment 0.25% 0.5% Phase (Age Cohort &lt;2 years) Dorzolamide 2% Diastolic BP (mm Hg) 53 62.4 (16.00) 60.8 (15.27) -1.6 (19.63) 3.0 (37.15) Diastolic BP (mmHg) Dorzolamide 2% 64 67.3 (11.83) 66.8 (10.83) -0.4 (13.69) 2.2 (22.91)</cell></row><row><cell cols="9">Dorzolamide 2% (N=66) 26 67.9 (12.70) 66.7 (13.81) -1.2 (11.68) -0.7 (18.46) Timolol GFS 0.5% (N=35) Dorzolamide 2% (m=19) Timolol GFS 0.5% 35 63.8 (11.22) 61.4 (10.01) -2.4 (11.49) -1.6 (18.96) (m=11) n (%) n (%) n (%) n N Mean (SD) (%) 1 (1.5%) 0 0 0 0 Baseline Treatment Change % Change Dorzolamide 2% Timolol GFS Timolol GFS Treatment Phase Treatment 0.25% 0.5% Blurred vision Pulse Rate 52 110.3 (21.13) 108.3 (22.19) -2.0 (27.04) 1.4 (28.93) Pulse Rate Dorzolamide 2% 65 98.3 (15.55) 99.3 (15.43) 0.9 (18.08) 2.8 (21.07) 0 Burning/stinging, eye 9 (13.6%) 3 (8.6%) 0 0 1 Monotherapy Dorzolamide 2% 18 21.6 (4.5) 22.9 (3.3) 1.3 (4.3) 10.9 (29.6) (beats per minute) Timolol GFS 26 104.7 (18.43) 115.3 (25.98) 10.6 (24.35) 12.1 (26.19) (beats per minute) Timolol GFS 35 104.5 (14.58) 99.6 (15.44) -4.9 (17.16) -3.2 (20.70) 0 Discharge, eye 0 0 4 (11.4%) 0 0 0 Timolol GFS 0.25% 10 25.1 (4.5) 23.3 (2.5) -1.8 (3.0) -6.0 (9.86) 0.25% 0.5% (9.1%) Foreign body sensation 1 (1.5%) 0 0 0 0 0 Overall Dorzolamide 2% 30 22.3 (4.2) 22.7 (4.0) 0.4 (4.3) 4.6 (25.3) Respiratory Rate Dorzolamide 2% 52 29.7 (12.27) 28.0 (10.46) -1.7 (8.63) -1.6 (22.66) Respiratory Rate Dorzolamide 2% 61 23.7 (5.86) 23.2 (4.33) -0.5 (5.43) 1.0 (21.78) 0 Inflammation, eyelid 2 (3.0%) 0 0 0 0 0 0 Injection, conjunctival 2 (3.0%) 1 (2.9%) 0 0 1 (9.1%) Injection, ocular 7 (10.6%) 6 (17.1%) 0 0 2 (18.2%) Timolol GFS 0.25% 15 24.4 (4.5) 22.8 (3.0) -1.6 (3.6) -4.8 (14.07) (breaths per minute) Timolol GFS 25 30.2 (16.98) 28.7 (14.20) -1.4 (6.24) -1.4 (16.69) (breaths per minute) Timolol GFS 34 23.9 (5.29) 23.9 (4.96) -0.0 (5.01) 2.2 (20.74) 0.25% 0.5% N = Sample size.
