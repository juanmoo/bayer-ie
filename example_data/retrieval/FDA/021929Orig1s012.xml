<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES REQUIREMENTS</head><p>Title IX, Subtitle A, Section 901 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA) amends the FDCA to authorize FDA to require the submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for an approved drug if the FDA becomes aware of new safety information and makes a determination that such a strategy is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks (section 505-1(a)). This provision took effect on March 25, 2008.</p><p>Since SYMBICORT was approved July 2006, FDA has become aware of an increased incidence of lower respiratory tract infections in patients with COPD who take SYMBICORT. This information is from controlled clinical trials (one 6-month and one 12-month safety and efficacy trial) submitted with this supplemental new drug application. This information was not available when SYMBICORT was granted marketing authorization. Therefore, we consider this information to be "new safety information" as defined in FDAAA.</p><p>In accordance with section 505-1 of FDCA, as one element of a REMS, FDA may require the development of a Medication Guide as provided for under 21 CFR Part 208. Your previously approved Medication Guide has been revised to include the new safety information. Pursuant to 21 CFR Part 208, FDA has determined that SYMBICORT poses a serious and significant public health concern requiring distribution of a Medication Guide. The Medication Guide is necessary for patients' safe and effective use of SYMBICORT. FDA has determined that SYMBICORT is a product that has serious risks (relative to benefits) of which patients should be made aware because information concerning the risks could affect patients' decisions to use, or continue to use SYMBICORT. FDA has also determined that Symbicort is a product for which patient labeling could help prevent serious adverse events. Under 21 CFR 208, you are responsible for ensuring that the Medication Guide is available for distribution to patients who are dispensed SYMBICORT.</p><p>Your proposed REMS, submitted on January 15, 2009, and appended to this letter, is approved. The REMS consists of the Medication Guide included with this letter and the timetable for submission of assessments of the REMS included in your January 15, 2009, submission.</p><p>Your assessment of the REMS should include:</p><p>a. An evaluation of patients' understanding of the serious risks of Symbicort.</p><p>Prominently identify submissions containing REMS assessments or proposed modifications of the REMS with the following wording in bold capital letters at the top of the first page of the submission: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5) February 2009 --------------------INDICATIONS AND USAGE--------------------</head><p>SYMBICORT is a combination product containing a corticosteroid and a longacting beta 2 -adrenergic agonist indicated for:</p><p>• Maintenance treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older. (1.1) •</p><p>Maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. (1.2) Important limitations:</p><p>• Not indicated for patients whose asthma can be managed by inhaled corticosteroids with occasional use of inhaled short-acting beta <ref type="bibr">2</ref>  • Deterioration of disease and acute episodes: Do not initiate in acutely deteriorating asthma or to treat acute symptoms. <ref type="bibr">(5.2)</ref> • Use with additional long-acting beta 2 -agonist: Do not use in combination because of risk of overdose.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WARNING: RISK OF ASTHMA RELATED DEATH</head><p>Long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonists may increase the risk of asthma-related death. Therefore, when treating patients with asthma, SYMBICORT should only be used for patients not adequately controlled on other asthma-controller medications (e.g., low-to-medium dose inhaled corticosteroids) or whose disease severity clearly warrants initiation of treatment with two maintenance therapies. Data from a large placebocontrolled U.S. study that compared the safety of another long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonist (salmeterol) or placebo added to usual asthma therapy showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in patients receiving salmeterol. This finding with salmeterol may apply to formoterol (a long-acting beta <ref type="bibr">2</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>-adrenergic agonist), one of the active ingredients in SYMBICORT [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INDICATIONS AND USAGE 1.1</head><p>Maintenance Treatment of Asthma SYMBICORT is indicated for the long-term, twice-daily, maintenance treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older.</p><p>Long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonists may increase the risk of asthma-related death [see Warnings and Precautions <ref type="bibr">(5.1)</ref>].</p><p>One of the active ingredients of SYMBICORT is formoterol, a long-acting beta 2 -agonist, therefore, when treating patients with asthma, SYMBICORT should only be used for patients not adequately controlled on other asthma-controller medications (e.g., low-to medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids) or whose disease severity clearly warrants initiation of treatment with 2 maintenance therapies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Important Limitations of Use:</head><p>• SYMBICORT is NOT indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm. • SYMBICORT is not indicated in patients whose asthma can be successfully managed by inhaled corticosteroids along with occasional use of inhaled, short-acting beta 2agonists.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Maintenance Treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</head><p>SYMBICORT 160/4.5 is indicated for the twice daily maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. SYMBICORT 160/4.5 is the only approved dosage for the treatment of airflow obstruction in COPD.</p><p>Important Limitations of Use: SYMBICORT is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</head><p>SYMBICORT should be administered twice daily every day by the orally inhaled route only. After inhalation, the patient should rinse the mouth with water without swallowing. [see Patient Counseling Information (17. <ref type="bibr">4</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>)]</head><p>Prime SYMBICORT before using for the first time by releasing two test sprays into the air away from the face, shaking well for 5 seconds before each spray. In cases where the inhaler has not been used for more than 7 days or when it has been dropped, prime the inhaler again by shaking well before each spray and releasing two test sprays into the air away from the face.</p><p>More frequent administration or a higher number of inhalations (more than 2 inhalations twice daily) of the prescribed strength of SYMBICORT is not recommended as some patients are more likely to experience adverse effects with higher doses of formoterol. Patients using SYMBICORT should not use additional long-acting beta 2 -agonists for any reason.</p><p>[See Warnings and Precautions <ref type="bibr">(5.3, 5.</ref>12)]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Asthma</head><p>If asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonist should be taken for immediate relief.</p><p>Adult and Adolescent Patients 12 Years of Age and Older: For patients 12 years of age and older, the dosage is 2 inhalations twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart).</p><p>The recommended starting dosages for SYMBICORT for patients 12 years of age and older are based upon patients' asthma severity.</p><p>For patients who are not currently receiving inhaled corticosteroid therapy, but whose disease severity clearly warrants initiation of treatment with 2 maintenance therapies, the recommended starting dose is SYMBICORT 80/4.5 or 160/4.5, two inhalations twice daily depending upon asthma severity.</p><p>The maximum recommended dosage is SYMBICORT 160/4.5 mg twice daily.</p><p>For all patients it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective strength after adequate asthma stability is achieved.</p><p>Improvement in asthma control following inhaled administration of SYMBICORT can occur within 15 minutes of beginning treatment, although maximum benefit may not be achieved for 2 weeks or longer after beginning treatment. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief.</p><p>For patients who do not respond adequately to the starting dose after 1-2 weeks of therapy with SYMBICORT 80/4.5, replacement with SYMBICORT 160/4.5 may provide additional asthma control.</p><p>If a previously effective dosage regimen of SYMBICORT fails to provide adequate control of asthma, the therapeutic regimen should be re-evaluated and additional therapeutic options, (e.g., replacing the lower strength of SYMBICORT with the higher strength, adding additional inhaled corticosteroid, or initiating oral corticosteroids) should be considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</head><p>For patients with COPD the recommended dose is SYMBICORT 160/4.5, two inhalations twice daily.</p><p>If shortness of breath occurs in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta <ref type="bibr">2</ref> -agonist should be taken for immediate relief.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS</head><p>SYMBICORT is available as a metered-dose inhaler containing a combination of budesonide (80 or 160 mcg) and formoterol (4.5 mcg) as an inhalation aerosol in the following two strengths: 80/4.5 and 160/4.5. Each dosage strength contains 60 or 120 actuations per/canister. Each strength of SYMBICORT is supplied with a red plastic actuator with a gray dust cap. 6</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CONTRAINDICATIONS</head><p>The use of SYMBICORT is contraindicated in the following conditions:</p><p>• Primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma or COPD where intensive measures are required. • Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in SYMBICORT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Risk of Asthma-related Death with Long-Acting Beta 2 -Adrenergic Agonists</head><p>Long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonists may increase the risk of asthma-related death [see Warnings and Precautions <ref type="bibr">(5.1)</ref>].</p><p>One of the active ingredients of SYMBICORT is formoterol, a long-acting beta 2 -agonist, therefore, when treating patients with asthma, SYMBICORT should only be used for patients not adequately controlled on other asthma-controller medications (e.g., low-to medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids) or whose disease severity clearly warrants initiation of treatment with 2 maintenance therapies.</p><p>A 28-week, placebo controlled US study comparing the safety of salmeterol with placebo, each added to usual asthma therapy, showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in patients receiving salmeterol (13/13,176 in patients treated with salmeterol vs 3/13,179 in patients treated with placebo; RR 4.37, 95% CI 1.25, 15.34). The increased risk of asthmarelated death may represent a class effect of the long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonists, including formoterol. No study adequate to determine whether the rate of asthma-related death is increased with SYMBICORT has been conducted.</p><p>Clinical studies with formoterol suggested a higher incidence of serious asthma exacerbations in patients who received formoterol than in those who received placebo. The sizes of these studies were not adequate to precisely quantify the differences in serious asthma exacerbation rates between treatment groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes</head><p>SYMBICORT should not be initiated in patients during rapidly deteriorating or potentially life-threatening episodes of asthma or COPD. SYMBICORT has not been studied in patients with acutely deteriorating asthma or COPD. The initiation of SYMBICORT in this setting is not appropriate.</p><p>Increasing use of inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonists is a marker of deteriorating asthma. In this situation, the patient requires immediate re-evaluation with reassessment of the treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for replacing the current strength of SYMBICORT with a higher strength, adding additional inhaled corticosteroid, or initiating systemic corticosteroids. Patients should not use more than 2 inhalations twice daily (morning and evening) of SYMBICORT.</p><p>SYMBICORT should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. An inhaled, short-acting beta 2agonist, not SYMBICORT, should be used to relieve acute symptoms such as shortness of breath. When prescribing SYMBICORT, the physician must also provide the patient with an inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonist (e.g., albuterol) for treatment of acute symptoms, despite regular twice-daily (morning and evening) use of SYMBICORT.</p><p>When beginning treatment with SYMBICORT, patients who have been taking oral or inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonists on a regular basis (e.g., 4 times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Excessive Use of SYMBICORT and Use with Other Long-Acting Beta 2 -Agonists</head><p>As with other inhaled drugs containing beta 2 -adrenergic agents, SYMBICORT should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medications containing long-acting beta 2 -agonists, as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. Patients using SYMBICORT should not use an additional long-acting beta 2 -agonist (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol fumarate, arformoterol tartrate) for any reason, including prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) or the maintenance treatment of asthma or COPD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Local Effects</head><p>In clinical studies, the development of localized infections of the mouth and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred in patients treated with SYMBICORT. When such an infection develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral antifungal) therapy while treatment with SYMBICORT continues, but at times therapy with SYMBICORT may need to be interrupted. Patients should rinse the mouth after inhalation of SYMBICORT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Pneumonia and Other Lower Respiratory Tract infections</head><p>Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of pneumonia and exacerbations frequently overlap. Lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, have been reported following the inhaled administration of corticosteroids.</p><p>In a 6 month study of 1,704 patients with COPD, there was a higher incidence of lung infections other than pneumonia (e.g., bronchitis, viral lower respiratory tract infections, etc.) in patients receiving SYMBICORT 160/4.5 (7.6%) than in those receiving SYMBICORT 80/4.5 (3.2%), formotero1 4.5 mcg (4.6%) or placebo (3.3%). Pneumonia did not occur with greater incidence in the SYMBICORT 160/4.5 group (1.1 %) compared with placebo (1.3%). In a 12-month study of 1,964 patients with COPD, there was also a higher incidence of lung infections other than pneumonia in patients receiving SYMBICORT 160/4.5 (8.1%) than in those receiving SYMBICORT 80/4.5 (6.9%), formoterol 4.5 mcg (7.1%) or placebo (6.2%). Similar to the 6 month study, pneumonia did not occur with greater incidence in the SYMBICORT 160/4.5 group (4.0%) compared with placebo (5.0%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6">Immunosuppression</head><p>Patients who are on drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals. Chicken pox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affects the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed, therapy with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chicken pox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. The immune responsiveness to varicella vaccine was evaluated in pediatric patients with asthma ages 12 months to 8 years with budesonide inhalation suspension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>9</head><p>An open-label, nonrandomized clinical study examined the immune responsiveness to varicella vaccine in 243 asthma patients 12 months to 8 years of age who were treated with budesonide inhalation suspension 0.25 mg to 1 mg daily (n=151) or noncorticosteroid asthma therapy (n=92) (i.e., beta 2 -agonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists, cromones). The percentage of patients developing a seroprotective antibody titer of ≥5.0 (gpELISA value) in response to the vaccination was similar in patients treated with budesonide inhalation suspension (85%), compared to patients treated with noncorticosteroid asthma therapy (90%). No patient treated with budesonide inhalation suspension developed chicken pox as a result of vaccination.</p><p>Inhaled corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; untreated systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7">Transferring Patients From Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy</head><p>Particular care is needed for patients who have been transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to inhaled corticosteroids because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function.</p><p>Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more per day of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although SYMBICORT may provide control of asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies.</p><p>During periods of stress or a severe asthma attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physicians for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress or a severe asthma attack.</p><p>Patients requiring oral corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to SYMBICORT. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis during therapy with SYMBICORT. Lung function (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV 1 ] or morning peak expiratory flow [PEF], beta-agonist use, and asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral corticosteroids. In addition to monitoring asthma signs and symptoms, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension.</p><p>Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to inhaled corticosteroids or SYMBICORT may unmask conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions). Some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.8">Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression</head><p>Budesonide, a component of SYMBICORT, will often help control asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone. Since budesonide is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses, the beneficial effects of SYMBICORT in minimizing HPA dysfunction may be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded and individual patients are titrated to the lowest effective dose.</p><p>Because of the possibility of systemic absorption of inhaled corticosteroids, patients treated with SYMBICORT should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response.</p><p>It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients, particularly when budesonide is administered at higher than recommended lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms. [See Dosage and Administration <ref type="bibr">(2.1)</ref>, Use in Specific Populations <ref type="bibr">(8.4</ref>).]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.15">Glaucoma and Cataracts</head><p>Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported in patients with asthma and COPD following the long-term administration of inhaled corticosteroids, including budesonide, a component of SYMBICORT. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts.</p><p>Effects of treatment with SYMBICORT 160/4.5, SYMBICORT 80/4.5, formoterol 4.5, or placebo on development of cataracts or glaucoma were evaluated in a subset of 461 patients with COPD in the 12-month study. Opthalmic examinations were conducted at baseline, 24 weeks, and 52 weeks. There were 26 subjects (6%) with an increase in posterior subcapsular score from baseline to maximum value (&gt;0.7) during the randomized treatment period. Changes in posterior subcapsular scores of &gt;0.7 from baseline to treatment maximum occurred in 11 patients (9.0%) in the SYMBICORT 160/4.5 group, 4 patients (3.8%) in the SYMBICORT 80/4.5 group, 5 patients (4.2%) in the formoterol group, and 6 patients (5.2%) in the placebo group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.16">Eosinophilic Conditions and Churg-Strauss Syndrome</head><p>In rare cases, patients on inhaled corticosteroids may present with systemic eosinophilic conditions. Some of these patients have clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition that is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events usually, but not always, have been associated with the reduction and/or withdrawal of oral corticosteroid therapy following the introduction of inhaled corticosteroids. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action</head><p>SYMBICORT SYMBICORT contains both budesonide and formoterol; therefore, the mechanisms of action described below for the individual components apply to SYMBICORT. These drugs represent two classes of medications (a synthetic corticosteroid and a long-acting selective beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist) that have different effects on clinical, physiological, and inflammatory indices of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and asthma.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Budesonide</head><p>Budesonide is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. In standard in vitro and animal models, budesonide has approximately a 200-fold higher affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and a 1000-fold higher topical anti-inflammatory potency than cortisol (rat croton oil ear edema assay). As a measure of systemic activity, budesonide is 40 times more potent than cortisol when administered subcutaneously and 25 times more potent when administered orally in the rat thymus involution assay.</p><p>In glucocorticoid receptor affinity studies, the 22R form of budesonide was two times as active as the 22S epimer. In vitro studies indicated that the two forms of budesonide do not interconvert.</p><p>Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of COPD and asthma. Corticosteroids have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (eg, mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (eg, histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic and non-allergic-mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in COPD and asthma.</p><p>Studies in asthmatic patients have shown a favorable ratio between topical anti-inflammatory activity and systemic corticosteroid effects over a wide range of doses of budesonide. This is explained by a combination of a relatively high local anti-inflammatory effect, extensive first pass hepatic degradation of orally absorbed drug (85%-95%), and the low potency of formed metabolites.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formoterol</head><p>Formoterol fumarate is a long-acting selective beta 2adrenergic agonist (beta 2 -agonist) with a rapid onset of action.</p><p>Inhaled formoterol fumarate acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. In vitro studies have shown that formoterol has more than 200-fold greater agonist activity at beta 2receptors than at beta 1 -receptors. The in vitro binding selectivity to beta 2 -over beta 1 -adrenoceptors is higher for formoterol than for albuterol (5 times), whereas salmeterol has a higher (3 times) beta 2 -selectivity ratio than formoterol.</p><p>Although beta 2 -receptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta 1 -receptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta 2receptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenergic receptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but they raise the possibility that even highly selective beta 2 -agonists may have cardiac effects.</p><p>The pharmacologic effects of beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including formoterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.</p><p>In vitro tests show that formoterol is an inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine and leukotrienes, from the human lung. Formoterol also inhibits histamineinduced plasma albumin extravasation in anesthetized guinea pigs and inhibits allergen-induced eosinophil influx in dogs with airway hyper-responsiveness. The relevance of these in vitro and animal findings to humans is unknown. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Budesonide Products</head><p>To confirm that systemic absorption is not a significant factor in the clinical efficacy of inhaled budesonide, a clinical study in patients with asthma was performed comparing 400 mcg budesonide administered via a pressurized metered dose inhaler with a tube spacer to 1400 mcg of oral budesonide and placebo. The study demonstrated the efficacy of inhaled budesonide but not orally ingested budesonide, despite comparable systemic levels. Thus, the therapeutic effect of conventional doses of orally inhaled budesonide are largely explained by its direct action on the respiratory tract.</p><p>Inhaled budesonide has been shown to decrease airway reactivity to various challenge models, including histamine, methacholine, sodium metabisulfite, and adenosine monophosphate in patients with hyperreactive airways. The clinical relevance of these models is not certain.</p><p>Pretreatment with inhaled budesonide, 1600 mcg daily (800 mcg twice daily) for 2 weeks reduced the acute (early-phase reaction) and delayed (late-phase reaction) decrease in FEV 1 following inhaled allergen challenge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>32</head><p>The systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids are related to the systemic exposure to such drugs. Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that in both adults and children with asthma the systemic exposure to budesonide is lower with SYMBICORT compared with inhaled budesonide administered at the same delivered dose via a dry powder inhaler [see Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics, SYMBICORT <ref type="bibr">(12.3)</ref>]. Therefore, the systemic effects (HPA axis and growth) of budesonide delivered from SYMBICORT would be expected to be no greater than what is reported for inhaled budesonide when administered at comparable doses via the dry powder inhaler [see Use in Specific Populations, Pediatric Use <ref type="bibr">(8.4)</ref>].</p><p>HPA Axis Effects: The effects of inhaled budesonide administered via a dry powder inhaler on the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis were studied in 905 adults and 404 pediatric patients with asthma. For most patients, the ability to increase cortisol production in response to stress, as assessed by cosyntropin (ACTH) stimulation test, remained intact with budesonide treatment at recommended doses. For adult patients treated with 100, 200, 400, or 800 mcg twice daily for 12 weeks, 4%, 2%, 6%, and 13%, respectively, had an abnormal stimulated cortisol response (peak cortisol &lt;14.5 mcg/dL assessed by liquid chromatography following shortcosyntropin test) as compared to 8% of patients treated with placebo. Similar results were obtained in pediatric patients. In another study in adults, doses of 400, 800, and 1600 mcg of inhaled budesonide twice daily for 6 weeks were examined; 1600 mcg twice daily (twice the maximum recommended dose) resulted in a 27% reduction in stimulated cortisol (6hour ACTH infusion) while 10-mg prednisone resulted in a 35% reduction. In this study, no patient on budesonide at doses of 400 and 800 mcg twice daily met the criterion for an abnormal stimulated-cortisol response (peak cortisol &lt;14.5 mcg/dL assessed by liquid chromatography) following ACTH infusion. An open-label, long-term follow-up of 1133 patients for up to 52 weeks confirmed the minimal effect on the HPA axis (both basal-and stimulated-plasma cortisol) of budesonide when administered at recommended doses. In patients who had previously been oral-steroid−dependent, use of budesonide in recommended doses was associated with higher stimulated-cortisol response compared to baseline following 1 year of therapy.</p></div>

However, the total systemic exposure of budesonide was comparable to that in asthma patients.</p><p>Peak steady-state plasma concentrations of budesonide administered by DPI in adults with asthma averaged 0.6 and 1.6 nmol/L at doses of 180 mcg and 360 mcg twice daily, respectively. In asthmatic patients, budesonide showed a linear increase in AUC and C max with increasing dose after both single and repeated dosing of inhaled budesonide.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COPD Patients:</head><p>In a single-dose study, 12 inhalations of SYMBICORT 80/4.5 mcg (total dose 960/54 mcg) were administered to patients with COPD. Mean budesonide peak plasma concentration of 3.3 nmol/L occurred at 30 minutes following dosing. Budesonide systemic exposure was comparable between SYMBICORT pMDI and coadministration of budesonide via a metered-dose inhaler and formoterol via a dry powder inhaler (budesonide 960 mcg and formoterol 54 mcg). In the same study, an open-label group of moderate asthma patients also received the same higher dose of SYMBICORT. For budesonide, COPD patients exhibited 12% greater AUC and 10% lower C max compared to asthma patients.</p><p>In the 6 month pivotal clinical study, steady-state pharmacokinetic data of budesonide was obtained in a subset of COPD patients with treatment arms of SYMBICORT pMDI 160/4.5 mcg, SYMBICORT pMDI 80/4.5 mcg, budesonide 160 mcg, budesonide 160 mcg and formoterol 4.5 mcg given together, all administered as two inhalations twice daily. Budesonide systemic exposure (AUC and C max ) increased proportionally with doses from 80 mcg to 160 mcg and was generally similar between the 3 treatment groups receiving the same dose of budesonide (SYMBICORT pMDI 160/4.5 mcg, budesonide 160 mcg, budesonide 160 mcg and formoterol 4.5 mcg administered together).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formoterol:</head><p>Inhaled formoterol is rapidly absorbed; peak plasma concentrations are typically reached at the first plasma sampling time, within 5-10 minutes after dosing. As with many drug products for oral inhalation, it is likely that the majority of the inhaled formoterol delivered is swallowed and then absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>Healthy Subjects: Following administration of SYMBICORT (160/4.5 mcg, two or four inhalations twice daily) for 5 days in healthy subjects, plasma concentration of formoterol generally increased in proportion to dose. The accumulation index for the group that received two inhalations twice daily was 1.77 for formoterol.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Asthma patients:</head><p>In a single-dose study, higher than recommended doses of SYMBICORT (12 inhalations of SYMBICORT 160/4.5 mcg) were administered to patients with moderate asthma. Peak plasma concentration for formoterol of 136 pmol occurred at 10 minutes following dosing. Approximately 8% of the delivered dose of formoterol was recovered in the urine as unchanged drug.</p><p>In a repeat dose study, the highest recommended dose of SYMBICORT (160/4.5 mcg, two inhalations twice daily) was administered to patients with moderate asthma and healthy subjects for 1 week. Peak formoterol plasma concentration of 28 pmol/L occurred at 10 minutes in asthma patients. Peak formoterol plasma concentration was about 42% lower in asthma patients compared to that in healthy subjects. However, the total systemic exposure of formoterol was comparable to that in asthma patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COPD patients:</head><p>Following single-dose administration of 12 inhalations of SYMBICORT 80/4.5, mean peak formoterol plasma concentration of 167 pmol/L was rapidly achieved at 15 minutes after dosing. Formoterol exposure was slightly greater (~16-18%) from SYMBICORT pMDI compared to coadministration of budesonide via a metered-dose inhaler and formoterol via a dry powder inhaler (total dose of budesonide 960 mcg and formoterol 54 mcg). In the same study, an open label group of moderate asthma patients received the same dose of SYMBICORT. COPD patients exhibited 12-15% greater AUC and C max for formoterol compared to asthma patients.</p><p>In the 6 month pivotal clinical study, steady-state pharmacokinetic data of formoterol was obtained in a subset of COPD patients with treatment arms of SYMBICORT pMDI 160/4.5 mcg, SYMBICORT pMDI 80/4.5. mcg, formoterol 4.5 mcg, budesonide 160 mcg and formoterol 4.5 mcg given together, all administered as two inhalations twice daily. The systemic exposure of formoterol as evidenced by AUC, was about 30% and 16% higher from SYMBICORT pMDI compared to formoterol alone treatment arm and coadministration of individual components of budesonide and formoterol treatment arm, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distribution: Budesonide:</head><p>The volume of distribution of budesonide was approximately 3 L/kg. It was 85%-90% bound to plasma proteins. Protein binding was constant over the concentration range (1-100 nmol/L) achieved with, and exceeding, recommended inhaled doses. Budesonide showed little or no binding to corticosteroid binding globulin. Budesonide rapidly equilibrated with red blood cells in a concentration independent manner with a blood plasma ratio of about 0.8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formoterol:</head><p>Over the concentration range of 10-500 nmol/L, plasma protein binding for the RR and SS enantiomers of formoterol was 46% and 58%, respectively. The concentrations of formoterol used to assess the plasma protein binding were higher than those achieved in plasma following inhalation of a single 54 mcg dose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metabolism: Budesonide:</head><p>In vitro studies with human liver homogenates have shown that budesonide was rapidly and extensively metabolized. Two major metabolites formed via cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) catalyzed biotransformation have been isolated and identified as 16αhydroxyprednisolone and 6ß-hydroxybudesonide. The corticosteroid activity of each of these two metabolites was less than 1% of that of the parent compound. No qualitative differences between the in vitro and in vivo metabolic patterns were detected. Negligible metabolic inactivation was observed in human lung and serum preparations.</p><p>Formoterol: The primary metabolism of formoterol is by direct glucuronidation and by O-demethylation followed by conjugation to inactive metabolites. Secondary metabolic pathways include deformylation and sulfate conjugation. CYP2D6 and CYP2C have been identified as being primarily responsible for O-demethylation. Elimination: Budesonide: Budesonide was excreted in urine and feces in the form of metabolites. Approximately 60% of an intravenous radiolabeled dose was recovered in the urine.</p><p>No unchanged budesonide was detected in the urine. The 22R form of budesonide was preferentially cleared by the liver with systemic clearance of 1.4 L/min vs 1.0 L/min for the 22S form. The terminal half-life, 2 to 3 hours, was the same for both epimers and was independent of dose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>37</head><p>Formoterol: The excretion of formoterol was studied in four healthy subjects following simultaneous administration of radiolabeled formoterol via the oral and IV routes. In that study, 62% of the radiolabeled formoterol was excreted in the urine while 24% was eliminated in the feces.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pediatric</head><p>Plasma concentrations of budesonide were measured following administration of four inhalations of SYMBICORT 160/4.5 mcg in a single-dose study in pediatric patients with asthma, 6-11 years of age.</p><p>Urine was collected for determination of formoterol excretion. Peak budesonide concentrations of 1.4 nmol/L occurred at 20 minutes postdose. Approximately 3.5% of the delivered formoterol dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged formoterol. This study also demonstrated that the total systemic exposure to budesonide from SYMBICORT was approximately 30% lower than from inhaled budesonide via a dry powder inhaler that was also evaluated at the same delivered dose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gender/Race</head><p>Specific studies to examine the effects of gender and race on the pharmacokinetics of SYMBICORT have not been conducted. Population PK analysis of the SYMBICORT data indicates that gender does not affect the pharmacokinetics of budesonide and formoterol. No conclusions can be drawn on the effect of race due to the low number of non-Caucasians evaluated for PK.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nursing Mothers</head><p>The disposition of budesonide when delivered by inhalation from a dry powder inhaler at doses of 200 or 400 mcg twice daily for at least 3 months was studied in eight lactating women with asthma from 1 to 6 months postpartum. Systemic exposure to budesonide in these women appears to be comparable to that in non-lactating women with asthma from other studies. Breast milk obtained over eight hours post-dose revealed that the maximum concentration of budesonide for the 400 and 800 mcg total daily doses was 0.39 and 0.78 nmol/L, respectively, and occurred within 45 minutes after dosing. The estimated oral daily dose of budesonide from breast milk to the infant is approximately 0.007 and 0.014 mcg/kg/day for the two dose regimens used in this study, which represents approximately 0.3% to 1% of the dose 38 inhaled by the mother. Budesonide levels in plasma samples obtained from five infants at about 90 minutes after breastfeeding (and about 140 minutes after drug administration to the mother) were below quantifiable levels (&lt;0.02 nmol/L in four infants and &lt;0.04 nmol/L in one infant) [see Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers <ref type="bibr">(8.3)</ref>].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Renal or Hepatic Insufficiency</head><p>There are no data regarding the specific use of SYMBICORT in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Reduced liver function may affect the elimination of corticosteroids. Budesonide pharmacokinetics was affected by compromised liver function as evidenced by a doubled systemic availability after oral ingestion. The intravenous budesonide pharmacokinetics was, however, similar in cirrhotic patients and in healthy subjects. Specific data with formoterol is not available, but because formoterol is primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism, an increased exposure can be expected in patients with severe liver impairment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Drug-Drug Interactions</head><p>A single-dose crossover study was conducted to compare the pharmacokinetics of eight inhalations of the following: budesonide, formoterol, and budesonide plus formoterol administered concurrently.

In two clinical studies comparing SYMBICORT with the individual components, improvements in most efficacy end points were greater with SYMBICORT than with the use of either budesonide or formoterol alone. In addition, one clinical study showed similar results between SYMBICORT and the concurrent use of budesonide and formoterol at corresponding doses from separate inhalers.</p><p>The safety and efficacy of SYMBICORT were demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled US clinical studies involving 1076 patients 12 years of age and older. Fixed SYMBICORT dosages of 160/9 mcg, and 320/9 mcg twice daily (each dose administered as two inhalations of the 80/4.5 and 160/4.5 mcg strengths, respectively) were compared with the monocomponents (budesonide and formoterol) and placebo to provide information about appropriate dosing to cover a range of asthma severity.</p></div>

The study included a 2-week run-in period with budesonide 80 mcg, two inhalations twice daily. Most patients had moderate to severe asthma and were using moderate to high doses of inhaled corticosteroids prior to study entry. Randomization was stratified by previous inhaled corticosteroid treatment (71.6% on moderate-and 28.4% on high-dose inhaled corticosteroid). Mean percent predicted FEV 1 at baseline was 68.1% and was similar across treatment groups. The coprimary efficacy end points were 12-hour-average postdose FEV 1 at week 2, and predose FEV 1 averaged over the course of the study. The study also required that patients who satisfied a predefined asthma worsening criterion be withdrawn. The predefined asthma-worsening criteria were a clinically important decrease in FEV 1 or peak expiratory flow (PEF), increase in rescue albuterol use, nighttime awakening due to asthma, emergency intervention or hospitalization due to asthma, or requirement for asthma medication not allowed by the protocol. For the criterion of nighttime awakening due to asthma, patients were allowed to remain in the study at the discretion of the investigator if none of the other asthmaworsening criteria were met.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What is the most important information I should know about SYMBICORT?</head><p>• SYMBICORT contains 2 medicines: o Budesonide (the same medicine found in PULMICORT FLEXHALER ® ), an inhaled corticosteroid medicine. Inhaled corticosteroids help to decrease inflammation in the lungs. Inflammation in the lungs can lead to asthma symptoms. o Formoterol (the same medicine found in FORADIL ® AEROLIZER ® ), a long-acting beta 2 -agonist medicine or LABA. LABA medicines are used in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. LABA medicines help the muscles around the airways in your lungs stay relaxed to prevent asthma symptoms, such as wheezing and shortness of breath. These symptoms can happen when the muscles around the airways tighten. This makes it hard to breathe. In severe cases, wheezing can stop your breathing and may lead to death if not treated right away.</p><p>• In patients with asthma, LABA medicines such as formoterol (one of the medicines in SYMBICORT) may increase the chance of death from asthma problems. In a large asthma study, more patients who used another LABA medicine died from asthma problems compared with patients who did not use that LABA medicine. Talk with your healthcare provider about this risk and the benefits of treating your asthma with SYMBICORT.</p><p>• SYMBICORT does not relieve sudden symptoms. Always have an inhaled short-acting beta 2agonist medicine with you to treat sudden symptoms. If you do not have this type of medicine, contact your healthcare provider to have one prescribed for you.</p><p>• Do not stop using SYMBICORT unless told to do so by your healthcare provider because your symptoms might get worse.</p><p>• SYMBICORT should be used only if your healthcare provider decides that another asthmacontroller medicine alone does not control your asthma or that you need two asthma-controller medicines.</p><p>• Call your healthcare provider if breathing problems worsen over time while using SYMBICORT. You may need different treatment.</p><p>• Get emergency medical care if: o Breathing problems worsen quickly, and o You use your short-acting beta 2 -agonist medicine, but it does not relieve your breathing problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What is SYMBICORT?</head><p>SYMBICORT combines an inhaled corticosteroid medicine, budesonide (the same medicine found in PULMICORT FLEXHALER), and a long-acting beta 2agonist medicine (LABA), formoterol (the same medicine found in FORADIL AEROLIZER).</p></div>

Because LABA medicines such as formoterol may increase the chance of death from asthma problems, SYMBICORT is not for patients with asthma who: o are well controlled with another asthma-controller medicine such as a low to medium dose of an inhaled corticosteroid medicine o only need short-acting beta 2 -agonist medicines once in awhile</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of SYMBICORT in asthma patients 6 to &lt;12 years of age has not been established.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Who should not use SYMBICORT?</head><p>Do not use SYMBICORT:</p><p>• to treat sudden severe symptoms of asthma or COPD. Know all the medicines you take. Keep a list and show it to your healthcare provider and pharmacist each time you get a new medicine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How do I use SYMBICORT?</head><p>See the step-by-step instructions for using SYMBICORT at the end of this Medication Guide. Do not use SYMBICORT unless your healthcare provider has taught you and you understand everything. Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>• Use SYMBICORT exactly as prescribed. Do not use SYMBICORT more often than prescribed. SYMBICORT comes in two strengths. Your healthcare provider has prescribed the strength that is best for you. Note the differences between SYMBICORT and your other inhaled medications, including the differences in prescribed use and physical appearance.</p><p>• SYMBICORT should be taken every day as two puffs in the morning and two puffs in the evening.</p><p>• If you miss a dose of SYMBICORT, you should take your next dose at the same time you normally do. Do not take SYMBICORT more often or use more puffs than you have been prescribed.</p><p>• Rinse your mouth with water and spit the water out after each dose (two puffs) of SYMBICORT. Do not swallow the water. This will help to lessen the chance of getting a fungus infection (thrush) in the mouth and throat.</p><p>• Do not spray SYMBICORT in your eyes. If you accidentally get SYMBICORT in your eyes, rinse your eyes with water, and if redness or irritation persists, consult your healthcare provider.</p><p>• Do not change or stop any medicines used to control or treat your breathing problems. Your healthcare provider will change your medicines as needed. • Make sure you always have a short-acting beta 2agonist medicine with you. Use your short-acting beta 2 -agonist medicine if you have breathing problems between doses of SYMBICORT.</p><p>• Call your healthcare provider or get medical care right away if: o your breathing problems worsen with SYMBICORT o you need to use your short-acting beta 2agonist medicine more often than usual o your short-acting beta 2 -agonist medicine does not work as well for you at relieving symptoms o you need to use four or more inhalations of your short-acting beta 2 -agonist medicine for 2 or more days in a row o you use one whole canister of your shortacting beta 2 -agonist medicine in 8 weeks' time o your peak flow meter results decrease. Your healthcare provider will tell you the numbers that are right for you. o your symptoms do not improve after using SYMBICORT regularly for 1 week.</p><p>What are the possible side effects with SYMBICORT?</p><p>• SYMBICORT contains formoterol. In patients with asthma, LABA medicines such as formoterol may increase the chance of death from asthma problems. See "What is the most important information I should know about SYMBICORT?"</p><p>• Pneumonia and other lower respiratory tract infections.

The proposed dose is two inhalations twice daily. The application is based on clinical efficacy and safety studies. This summary review will provide an overview of the application, with a focus on the clinical efficacy and safety studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background</head><p>There are several drug classes available for the relief of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD.

Overview of the clinical program Some characteristics of the pivotal studies that form the basis of review and regulatory decision for this application are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">Table 1</ref>. The design and conduct of these studies are briefly described below, followed by efficacy findings and conclusions. Safety findings are discussed in the following section. These studies were randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group in design, conducted in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. Patients were required to be 40 years of age and older; have a clinical diagnosis of COPD with symptoms for 2 years or longer, FEV1/FVC &lt;70%, FEV1 ≤ 50% predicted; be a current or previous smoker with a smoking history of ≥10 pack years; and have a history of at least one COPD exacerbation requiring a course of oral steroids within 1-12 months before the first visit. The studies had an initial screening period, followed by 6 months (for SHINE) or 12 moths (for SUN) double-blind treatment period. The treatment arms are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">Table  1</ref>. There are two issues with the treatment arms worth noting. First, unlike typical factorial design study for combination products where the active comparators are pharmaceutically the same as the combination product, in these studies the formoterol comparator was delivered via the Oxis Turbuhaler, which is different than the inhalation aerosol device in Symbicort. This was acceptable because for the asthma development program AstraZeneca conducted a pharmacodynamic study that resolved the pharmaceutical differences to support the use of different devices to deliver formoterol. Second, in the SHINE study AstraZeneca included a free combination of budesonide and formoterol to evaluate for a pharmaceutic interaction when budesonide and formoterol are administered in one device versus two devices.</p><p>The studies had two co-primary efficacy variables: pre-dose FEV1 to demonstrate the contribution of budesonide, and post-dose FEV1 to show the contribution of formoterol. The primary analysis was the change from baseline in the average of all FEV1, pre-dose or 1 hour post-dose, measurements during the randomized treatment period. Multiplicity was accounted for by a pre-specified hierarchical order requiring the higher dose to be positive to move to the lower dose. Other efficacy variables of interest were Saint Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), Breathlessness Diary Score, and COPD exacerbation. A COPD exacerbation was defined as worsening of COPD that at the discretion of the investigator required a course of oral corticosteroid treatment or hospitalization or both. There is no generally accepted definition of COPD exacerbations, but it usually includes some combination of symptoms and a change of treatment. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The definition of COPD exacerbation used in these two studies was entirely based upon oral corticosteroid use or hospitalization, which is not sufficient.</p><p>Safety assessment in these studies included adverse event recording, vital signs, physical examination, laboratory measure, ECGs, and urinary free cortisol measurement in a subgroup of patients (437 in SHINE and 179 in SUN studies). In the SUN study, 24 hour Holter monitoring, ophthalmologic assessment, and bone mineral density were included in a subgroup of patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-dose FEV 1</head><p>Change from baseline in average during treatment period (p-value) Other efficacy variables were supportive of efficacy of Symbicort in COPD, but the findings were not robus For SGRQ, the differences between Symbicort and placebo were statistically significantly different, but the minimal clinically important difference of 4 units was not reached in any study. For the Breathlessness Diary Score, the differences between Symbicort and placebo were also statistically significantly different, but the minimal clinically important difference of 0.2 units was only reached for Symbicort 160/4.5 in the SUN study. For COPD exacerbation, the findings were less convincing. The difference in rates of COPD exacerbation between Symbicort and placebo was significantly different in the SUN study for Symbicort 160/4.5, but the rates were not different in the SHINE study. The events were primarily driven by events requiring corticosteroid treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Safety</head><p>a. Safety database The safety assessment of Symbicort for COPD patients is based on studies shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">Table 1</ref>. The safety database is adequate and typical for other similar applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>b. Safety findings and conclusion</head><p>The submitted data support the safety of Symbicort in patients with COPD.</p><p>There were a total of 26 deaths in the two clinical studies. The number of deaths was generally similar across treatment groups and from causes expected in this study population. The percentage of patients with serious adverse events were higher in the Symbicort groups compared to placebo, but similar to formoterol group. Evaluation of these serious adverse events did not show any safety concerns. Adverse events occurring more in Symbicort group compared to placebo were typical of this class of drug and included events such as nasopharyngitis, oral candidiasis, bronchitis, and upper respiratory tract infections.</p><p>The incidence of pneumonia and other lung infection was carefully evaluated because of the known risk of lung infection in COPD patients on inhaled corticosteroids. The incidence of pneumonia was not increased in the two studies, but there was higher incidence of lung infection other than pneumonia (e.g., bronchitis, viral lower respiratory tract infections, etc.) in patients receiving Symbicort 160/4.5 compared to formoterol or placebo.</p><p>In a subset of patients, bone mineral density (n=326), ophthalmologic assessment (n=461), and Holter monitoring (n=520) were done. The changes in bone mineral density in these studies were small and not different between treatment groups. Ophthalmologic assessment did not show any differential changes in intraocular pressure among treatment groups. Opacification of the lens as assessed by lenticular opacity scale (LOCS III score)</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(b) (4) 6</formula><p>increased in all treatment groups over the course of the study with the largest increase occurring in the Symbicort 160/4.5 group. The Holter monitoring did not show any findings suggestive of a new safety signal. c. REMS/RiskMAP Symbicort has a Boxed Warning and a Medication Guide because of risk of asthma related death. In consultation with the Office of New Drugs and Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology (OSE) it was decided that the Medication Guide will now be considered part of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for the lower respiratory tract infections, as required by the FDAAA. Astra Zeneca will submit three assessments of the REMS at 18 month, 3 years, and 7 years from approval of this supplement. Information for the assessment of REMS may include but may not be limited to an evaluation of patients' understanding of the serious risks of Symbicort.</p></div>

Regulatory Action The applicant has submitted adequate data to support approval of Symbicort 160/4.5 for maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. The action on this application will be Approval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>b. Risk Benefit Assessment</head><p>The overall risk benefit assessment support approval of Symbicort 160/4.5 for maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. The risks associated with use of Symbicort in patients with COPD are typical of drug of this class that are associated with the use of inhaled budesonide and inhaled formoterol, which are described in the product label. There is a risk of lung infection with Symbicort in COPD patients, a finding that was also seen with Advair. Lung infection is a serious safety finding, but it is reasonable to expect that health care providers taking care of patients with COPD will be able to readily diagnose <ref type="bibr">8</ref> them, differentiate them from a COPD exacerbation, and treat these appropriately. The REMS will also assure that health care providers and patients are aware of lung infection with Symbicort. The benefits of Symbicort 160/4.5 outweigh these risks and justify approval. Relief of airflow obstruction is a clinically meaningful improvement in COPD patients and by itself is not a trivial benefit. There are limited treatment choices for patients with COPD and additional treatment options for COPD are desired. c. Post-marketing Risk Management Activities Symbicort currently has a Medication Guide, which will now be considered part of REMS. Risk management activities will fall under the provision of REMS (discussed in section 8c above).</p></div>

The pharmacology/toxicology reviewer, Dr. Timothy Robison, recommends approval of this supplemental NDA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Clinical Pharmacology/Biopharmaceutics</head><p>Since Symbicort is an approved product, the Applicant submitted a complete clinical pharmacology package in the original NDA to support the asthma indication. In this supplemental NDA, the Applicant submitted data to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of budesonide and formoterol delivered via Symbicort in patients with COPD and to assess the effect of Symbicort on the HPA axis in patients with COPD. PK assessments were included in a subset of patients in SHINE (6 month study) and HPA axis assessments were included in a subset of patients in SHINE and SUN (12 month study). The results were reviewed by the clinical pharmacology reviewer, Dr. Partha Roy, who recommends approval of this supplemental NDA pending agreement on labeling. The findings are summarized briefly below.</p><p>The PK results show that formoterol exposure from Symbicort 160/4.5 was 16-18% higher compared to the monotherapy products administered together and 30% higher compared to formoterol delivered via the Oxis Turbuhaler. This suggests a formulation effect and a possible drug-drug interaction effect. Regarding budesonide exposure, the exposure for Symbicort is similar to the monotherapy products administered together and budesonide alone. Comparing patients with asthma and COPD, there is a 12-16% increase in budesonide and formoterol exposure in COPD patients compared to asthma patients.</p><p>Regarding the HPA axis assessments, 24 hour urinary free cortisol (UFC) was measured in a subset of patients in SHINE (n=437) and SUN (n=179). Urine was collected over 24 hours at baseline, Month 6 and Month 12 (SUN only). The results suggest that there is a dose dependent effect on the 24 hour UFC with Symbicort: a 17% decrease in 24 hour UFC with Symbicort 80/4.5 and a 30% decrease in 24 hour UFC with Symbicort 160/4.5 compared to placebo, which was statistically significant. These results will be described in the product label.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Clinical Microbiology</head><p>Symbicort Inhalation Aerosol 160/4.5 is an approved product and there are no clinical microbiology issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Clinical/Statistical-Efficacy</head><p>To support the proposed COPD indication, AZ submitted the results of two phase 3, placebo controlled clinical trials of 6 and 12 months duration, Study D589900002 and Study D589900001, hereafter referred to as SHINE and SUN, respectively. In addition there were some support clinical pharmacology studies in patients with COPD as shown in the table (b) <ref type="bibr">(4)</ref> • Symbicort HFA MDI 160/4.5 and placebo Turbuhaler -two inhalations BID • Symbicort HFA MDI 80/4.5 and placebo Turbuhaler -two inhalations BID • budesonide HFA MDI 160mcg and formoterol OXIS Turbuhaler 4.5mcg -two inhalations BID • budesonide HFA MDI 160mcg and placebo Turbuhaler -two inhalations BID • formoterol OXIS Turbuhaler and placebo Turbuhaler -two inhalations BID • placebo HFA MDI and placebo Turbuhaler -two inhalations BID A brief discussion of the treatment groups is warranted because typically for combination product programs, we recommend that the comparator groups are the same formulation and device as the combination product. The budesonide comparator is the same formulation and device as Symbicort without the formoterol. However, the formoterol comparator is delivered via the Oxis Turbuhaler, which is not the same formulation or device as Symbicort. Formoterol Oxis Turbuhaler is a dry powder formulation of formoterol which is available outside the US. In the asthma development program, AZ conducted a pharmacodynamic study that resolved the pharmaceutic differences from the use of different devices to deliver formoterol. Therefore, the use of formoterol Oxis Turbuhaler in this program is acceptable. In addition, the Applicant included a free combination of budesonide and formoterol to evaluate for a pharmaceutic interaction when budesonide and formoterol are administered in one device as Symbicort.</p><p>Long acting beta agonists and long acting anticholinergics were not allowed and were converted to short acting beta agonists and anticholinergics, respectively. Inhaled corticosteroids (other than randomized study medication), xanthine derivatives, and chronic oral corticosteroids were not allowed during the randomized treatment period. Albuterol was provided as rescue medication. Patients were evaluated during a clinic visit approximately once a month.</p><p>There were two co-primary efficacy variables: pre-dose FEV1 and 1 hour post-dose FEV1. The primary analysis was the change from baseline in the average of all the FEV1 (pre-dose or 1 hour post-dose) measurements during the randomized treatment period. The contribution of formoterol to the combination was evaluated by comparing Symbicort and budesonide for 1hour post-dose FEV1. The contribution of budesonide to the combination was evaluated by comparing Symbicort and formoterol for pre-dose FEV1. Because there are two doses of Symbicort with comparison of each to dose to monotherapies, multiplicity was accounted for by pre-specifying a hierarchical order requiring statistical significance in order to move onto the next comparison. First, the higher dose of Symbicort was specified to be compared with the monotherapies, followed by the lower dose. Serial spirometry (pre-dose, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 360, 480, 600, and 720 minutes post-dose) was performed in a subset of patients.</p><p>Secondary efficacy variables included the Saint Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), Breathlessness Diary scores, and COPD exacerbations. In addition, patients were given diaries to record daily AM and PM PEF, rescue medication use, oral corticosteroid use, Breathlessness Diary, cough, and sputum symptoms, nighttime awakenings, and hospitalization. A COPD exacerbation was defined as worsening of COPD that at the establish the contribution of formoterol and budesonide and numerically favor Symbicort 160/4.5 over Symbicort 80/4.5. Secondary efficacy variables, including SGRQ, COPD exacerbations (as defined by the Sponsor), symptoms, PEF, and rescue medication use also support the efficacy of Symbicort. Dr. Guo has verified the Applicant's primary efficacy results and Dr. Karimi-Shah has concluded that the efficacy results of SHINE and SUN support the efficacy of Symbicort 160/4.5 for the proposed indication. I concur with this conclusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Safety</head><p>While Symbicort is an approved product for the treatment of asthma, this efficacy supplement would extend the indication to COPD patients, which is a new population. Therefore, extensive safety monitoring was included in the phase 3 program. Safety monitoring in SHINE and SUN included adverse events, vital signs, physical examination, ECGs, chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and urinary free cortisol in a subgroup of patients (n=437 in SHINE and n=179 in SUN). SUN also included the following safety measurements: 24 hour Holter monitoring, ophthalmologic assessment, and bone mineral density (BMD) in a subgroup of patients. Of special interest in both clinical trials is the risk of pneumonia and lower respiratory tract infections that was noted in the COPD program for another ICS/LABA combination product, Advair Diskus.</p><p>In SHINE and SUN, there were 558 and 988 patients treated with Symbicort for 6 months and one year, respectively. In addition, there were 287 patients treated with the free combination of budesonide and formoterol in SHINE. The number of patients and duration of exposure to Symbicort is acceptable to assess the safety of Symbicort in the COPD population.</p><p>In both SHINE and SUN, fewer patients discontinued in the Symbicort treatment groups compared to the other treatment groups. The primary reason for discontinuation was adverse events followed by withdrawal of consent/not willing to continue. In SHINE, there were fewer discontinuations due to AEs in the Symbicort treatment groups compared to placebo, budesonide or formoterol treatment groups. In SUN, discontinuations due to AEs were similar among the treatment groups.</p><p>There were a total of 26 deaths during the randomized treatment period in SHINE and SUN. The number of deaths in each treatment group was few and generally similar across treatment groups; however, there was a numerically higher number of deaths in the Symbicort 80/4.5 group (10) compared to Symbicort 160/4.5 (6), budesonide (2), formoterol (3), and placebo <ref type="bibr">(5)</ref>. It is difficult to draw any conclusions from this numerical imbalance for the lower dose of Symbicort due to the fact that the number of deaths was overall low and the causes of death do not support a specific etiology. In addition, there does not appear to be a dose ordering effect as the number of deaths with the higher dose of Symbicort was similar to placebo.</p><p>The percentage of patients with SAEs was numerically higher in the Symbicort treatment groups compared to placebo, but was similar to the formoterol group. The most common SAE was COPD, which was more common in the Symbicort groups compared to placebo, but occurred in a similar percentage of patients in the formoterol group. There was no increase in pneumonia SAEs in the Symbicort treatment groups compared to placebo. Review of the SAEs does not suggest a specific signal.</p><p>In SHINE, adverse events (AEs) in the Symbicort 160/4.5 treatment group (57.4%) were reported in a similar percentage of patients as the budesonide (57.5%) and formoterol (56.7%) groups, but slightly higher than in the free combination (49.5%) and placebo groups (50.7%). The most common AEs included: COPD, nasopharyngitis, oral candidiasis, bronchitis, sinusitis, and diarrhea. In SUN, AEs were more common in the Symbicort treatment groups (65%) compared to placebo (55%). The most common AEs were similar to SHINE and also included upper respiratory tract infection, back pain and muscle spasms.</p><p>Of particular interest were the pneumonia and lower respiratory tract AEs, as these AEs have been noted in the COPD program for another ICS/LABA combination product, Advair Diskus. In general, pneumonia AEs were not increased in the Symbicort groups compared to placebo. However, there was an increase in other lower respiratory tract infections in the Symbicort 160/4.5 compared to other treatment groups. These other lower respiratory tract infections included: bronchitis, tracheobronchitis, and lower respiratory tract infection -bacterial or viral. The specific data is as follows. In the 1,704 patients with COPD in SHINE, there was a higher incidence of lung infections other than pneumonia (e.g., bronchitis, viral lower respiratory tract infections, etc.) in patients receiving SYMBICORT 160/4.5 (7.6%) than in those receiving Symbicort 80/4.5 (3.2%), formoterol 4.5 mcg (4.6%) or placebo (3.3%). Pneumonia did not occur with greater incidence in the Symbicort 160/4.5 group (1.1%) compared with placebo (1.3%). In 1,964 patients with COPD in SUN, there was also a higher incidence of lung infections other than pneumonia in patient receiving SYMBICORT 160/4.5 (8.1%) than in those receiving Symbicort 80/4.5 (6.9%), formoterol 4.5 mcg (7.1%) or placebo (6.2%). Similar to the 6 month study, pneumonia did not occur with greater incidence in the Symbicort 160/4.5 group (4.0%) compared with placebo (5.0%).</p><p>The increase in lower respiratory tract infections may be secondary to the budesonide component and is consistent with the findings in the COPD program for the other combination product, Advair Diskus. This information will be highlighted in the product label in the Warnings and Precautions section.</p><p>Bone mineral density (n=326), ophthalmologic assessments (n=461) and Holter monitoring (n=520) were performed in a subset of patients in SUN. BMD was measured as the change from baseline to endpoint in total lumbar spine bone mineral density. At the end of the treatment period, the change from baseline in BMD was small and the difference between treatment groups was small. The effects of Symbicort on the eye were assessed by the lenticular opacity scale (LOCSIII score) and intraocular pressure. At the end of the treatment period, there was an increase in intraocular pressure in all treatment groups. The change from baseline was small and similar across treatment groups, with the Symbicort 80/4.5 group showing the largest increase from baseline (0.69mmHg). For the posterior subcapsular opacity assessment, there was an increase across treatment groups. The change from baseline was small with the Symbicort 160/4.5 group showing the largest increase (0.18). The Holter monitoring results did not suggest a new safety signal. The results for the BMD and ophthalmologic assessments will be described in the product label.</p><p>There were no new safety signals noted in the laboratory, ECG, vital sign, and physical examination data.</p><p>In summary, SHINE and SUN support the safety of Symbicort 160/4.5 for the maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD. Overall, there were fewer discontinuations in the Symbicort treatment groups compared to the other treatment groups. Although there was no increase in pneumonia AEs in the Symbicort 160/4.5 group, there was an increase in lower respiratory tract infection AEs compared to the other treatment groups and this will be included in the product label. This new safety information will also be the basis for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy or REMS. See Section 13 for more discussion. Dr. Karimi-Shah has concluded that the results of SHINE and SUN support the safety of Symbicort 160/4.5 for the proposed indication. I concur with this conclusion.</p></div>

Symbicort is a fixed-dose combination product of budesonide (corticosteroid) and formoterol fumarate dihydrate (long-acting beta-agonist). The drug product is a pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) using HFA 227 as the propellant. Although two dosage strengths are approved for treatment of asthma (80/4.5 and 160/4.5), the dose proposed for registration in this COPD efficacy supplement is 320/9 mcg (2 puffs of 160/4.5 budesonide/formoterol) BID. Symbicort is already approved for the maintenance treatment of asthmatic patients 12 years of age and older, at total daily doses from 160/9 mcg BID to 320/9 mcg BID. The efficacy and safety of Symbicort in this COPD population is supported by two pivotal trials, of 6 months and 12 months duration, respectively.

Karimi-Shah, MD NDA 21-929 SE005 Symbicort ®, Budesonide/Formoterol 8 per actuation were evaluated in SUN and SHINE. These dosage strengths, each administered as 2 actuations twice daily (BID), correspond to total daily doses of 320/18 mcg and 640/18 mcg; hereafter, these study medications will be referred to as Symbicort LD (low-dose) and HD (highdose), respectively. The clinical development program for COPD was designed to characterize the efficacy and safety of two dosage strengths of Symbicort as long-term maintenance therapy in patients with COPD, and to demonstrate that Symbicort meets the FDA combination rule regarding the development of fixed-combination prescription drugs for use in humans [21 CFR 300.50].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.2">Efficacy</head><p>Two pivotal clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy of Symbicort in patients with COPD. These trials were multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group studies that were 6 and 12 months in duration, named SHINE and SUN respectively. In SHINE, patients were assigned to one of six treatment arms: Symbicort HD BID, Symbicort LD BID, budesonide 160 mcg + 4.5 mcg formoterol in free combination BID, budesonide 2 x 160 mcg BID, formoterol 2 x 4.5 mcg BID, or placebo BID. The study consisted of an initial visit, a 2-week run-in period, 5 further visits during a 26-week treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up telephone call. In SUN, patients were assigned to one of four treatment arms: Symbicort HD BID, Symbicort LD BID, formoterol 2 x 4.5 mcg BID, or placebo BID for a randomized treatment period of 52 weeks. The design was identical to that of SHINE, except that there were seven visits over the longer treatment period. Efficacy was assessed via pulmonary function testing at each visit.</p><p>The co-primary efficacy endpoints in both studies were the change from baseline to endpoint in pre-dose FEV1, to demonstrate the anti-inflammatory contribution of budesonide, and 1-hr postdose FEV1, to demonstrate the bronchodilator contribution of formoterol, to the efficacy of the combination product, Symbicort. Each co-primary variable was calculated as an average over the randomized treatment period. In SUN and SHINE, the primary comparison for the pre-dose FEV1 endpoint was between each of the Symbicort groups and formoterol. Results indicate that only the higher dose of Symbicort (320/9 mcg BID) demonstrated a statistically significantly greater increase from baseline in pre-dose FEV1 when compared with formoterol. Symbicort LD failed to show the contribution of the inhaled corticosteroid to the efficacy of the combination product..</p><p>In SHINE, the primary comparison for the post-dose FEV1 endpoint was between each of the Symbicort groups and budesonide alone. For post-dose FEV1, results indicate that both dosage strengths of Symbicort demonstrated a statistically significantly greater increase from baseline when compared with budesonide. These results demonstrated that formoterol contributes to the efficacy of the combination product. These results were supported by the SUN study, however, this 12 month study did not include a budesonide group for comparison, so the primary comparison was between the Symbicort treatment groups and placebo.</p><p>Key secondary endpoints were defined by the Applicant as dyspnea (as measured by the Breathlessness Diary), the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and COPD Clinical Review Banu A. Karimi-Shah, MD NDA 21-929 SE005 Symbicort ®, Budesonide/Formoterol 9 exacerbations. COPD exacerbations, as defined by the applicant, occurred at a numerically lower rate in both pivotal studies. The SGRQ and Breathlessness Diary were also generally supportive of the efficacy of Symbicort. However, for various reasons, including failure to meet minimal clinically important differences, issues with the instrument, or concerns regarding endpoint definition, these key secondary variables . Other secondary variables that were measured included serial FEV1 measurements, morning and evening peak expiratory flow (PEF), COPD symptoms (rescue medication use, cough, sputum, and sleep score. These secondary variables were generally supportive of the efficacy of Symbicort.</p><p>In conclusion, findings from two pivotal COPD studies (SUN and SHINE) support the efficacy of Symbicort HD therapy for the long-term treatment of airway obstruction in patients with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.3">Safety</head><p>The safety of Symbicort in COPD patients was assessed in two pivotal studies with reports of deaths, adverse events, laboratory values, vital signs, and physical exams. Additional safety information regarding effect on the ophthalmologic exam, bone mineral density, and 24 hour Holter monitoring was assessed in the SUN (12 month) study only. Effect on the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis was also assessed in a subset of patients from both studies (see 7.1.12 Special Safety Studies). A summary of the safety information is presented below.</p><p>There were 26 deaths reported during the randomized treatment period in the two pivotal trials: 6 in the Symbicort HD group, 10 in the Symbicort LD group, 2 in the budesonide group, 3 in the formoterol group, and 5 in the placebo group. Nineteen of the 26 deaths were reported in the non-US regions, and 7 were reported in the US region. The most frequently reported SAE leading to death was COPD exacerbation: 3 subjects in the Symbicort LD group and 1 subject in the budesonide group. Other causes of death included cardiac and malignancy-related SAEs. Overall, there were relatively few deaths in this study, considering the severity of COPD in the study population and the presence of co-morbid conditions in this older population. Review of the narratives and the causes of death did not suggest a particular safety signal.</p><p>Across the Phase 3 studies, the profile of the most commonly reported adverse events (COPD, nasopharyngitis, oral candidiasis, bronchitis and sinusitis), was generally similar in the Symbicort and the mono-products groups, but the incidence of AEs and SAEs was higher on active treatments compared to placebo. Most AEs were mild to moderate in intensity with Symbicort treatment. Overall, the percentage of subjects with SAEs was slightly higher in the Symbicort and formoterol 4.5 groups compared to placebo. COPD was the most common SAE reported with a similar frequency across the Symbicort and formoterol groups, with a slightly higher frequency in these groups compared to placebo. Discontinuations from the study due to adverse events (DAEs) were similarly distributed across the treatment groups. Reviewer's comment: The frequency of COPD SAEs may reflect the underlying severity of the enrolled COPD population. This finding may be related to the greater and earlier discontinuation in the placebo group, which may have reduced the chance for discontinued subjects in this group with very severe COPD to contribute SAEs.</p><p>Pneumonia-related preferred terms and "potential lung infections other than pneumonia" containing preferred terms that could represent lower respiratory tract infections were evaluated due to findings in recent studies (1-3) of the fluticasone/salmeterol combination in subjects with COPD that indicated a higher rate of pneumonia in all groups receiving fluticasone. For pneumonia-related preferred terms, no clinically important differences were seen between treatment groups. However, when the incidence of "potential lung infections other than pneumonia" was evaluated, there was a higher incidence in those groups treated with budesonide as compared with placebo. In SUN, there was a numerical trend towards increased lung infections with higher doses of inhaled corticosteroid. This is consistent with the findings with fluticasone/salmeterol in patients with COPD and will be described in the product label. This safety signal of increased "lung infections other than pneumonia" is new information that will be the basis of a Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy (REMS) [see Section 1.2.1].</p><p>Additional safety analyses of vital signs, laboratory findings, bone mineral density assessments, ophthalmologic examinations, and holter monitoring did not reveal clinically significant results between treatment groups. Symbicort did exhibit statistically significant (~30%) suppression of 24-hour urinary free cortisol, indicating a suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function in patients with COPD (see 7.1.12 Special Safety Studies).</p><p>In general, the adverse event profile of Symbicort was consistent with known effects of inhaled corticosteroids and beta-agonists, the safety findings in asthma patients, as well as with what would be expected in a COPD population. In summary, the clinical trial results support the safety of Symbicort in COPD patients. Review of the safety data indicates that lung infections other than pneumonia, (including bronchitis, lower respiratory tract infection, etc.) may be a new safety signal noted with Symbicort in COPD patients and is consistent with another ICS/LABA combination product. No other new safety concerns arose from the review of the data in COPD patients as compared with what has been reported in the Symbicort product label and other ICS/LABA combination products.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.3">Study Design</head><p>The two pivotal trials had the same general design. Both were phase III, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, active-controlled, parallel group trials in patients with COPD. The patients enrolled were of either sex, ≥ 40 years of age with a FEV1 ≤ 50% of predicted normal value pre-bronchodilator, a FEV1/FVC &lt;70% prebronchodilator, had a clinical diagnosis of COPD with symptoms for ≥ 2 years, were current or previous smokers with a smoking history of ≥10 pack years, had a score of ≥ 2 on the MMRC dyspnea scale, a total symptom score (based on breathlessness, cough and sputum) of ≥ 2 per day for at least half of the run-in period, had a history of at least one COPD exacerbation requiring a course of oral steroids within 1-12 months before Visit 1, used short-acting inhaled bronchodilator (B2-agonists or anticholinergics) as rescue medication, had no history of asthma, and no history of allergic rhinitis before 40 years of age. The duration of SHINE was 6 months; the duration of SUN was 12 months.</p><p>Both studies consisted of an initial visit, a 2 week-run in period, 5 further visits during a 26-week treatment period (in SHINE), 7 further visits during a 52-week treatment period (in SUN), and a 4-week follow-up telephone call. Prior to Visit 1, fixed dose combination therapy was to be replaced with a comparable dose of ICS monotherapy and a short-acting inhaled beta agonist. Patients using either long-acting beta agonists or anticholinergics were to be converted to a short-acting bronchodilator of the same class. Between Visits 1 and 2, patients were allowed to continue use of inhaled steroids and/or short-acting inhaled bronchodilators. At Visit 2, treatment with ICS was to be discontinued, and all eligible patients were randomized to receive one of the study treatments.</p><p>The co-primary efficacy endpoints in both studies were change from baseline in pre-dose FEV1, to demonstrate the anti-inflammatory contribution of budesonide, and post-dose FEV1, to demonstrate the bronchodilator contribution of formoterol, to the efficacy of the combination product, Symbicort. Each co-primary variable was calculated as an average over the randomized treatment period (primary analysis). Dyspnea scores as measured by the Breathlessness Diary (BD), SGRQ, and COPD exacerbations were defined as key secondary endpoints. Additional secondary endpoints, including spirometric and non-spirometric variables, were also examined. These other secondary endpoints included AM and PM peak expiratory flow, serial FEV1, FVC, rescue medication use, oral steroid use, symptom scores, sleep scores, health care economics, and pharmacokinetic variables (in SHINE only). The primary analysis for all efficacy variables was performed using all-randomized subjects (ITT population).</p></div>

Baseline percent predicted FEV1, postbronchodilator percent predicted FEV1, and smoking history (pack years) were well-balanced across all treatment groups. Severity classification, based on the GOLD 2006 criteria applied to post-bronchodilator FEV1 at Visit 1, indicated that approximately 80% of the study population had severe or very severe COPD, while 20% had moderate COPD at entry. In general, demographic and key baseline characteristics were similar across treatment groups and geographic regions (US vs. non-US).

A statistically significant interaction was observed for race, particularly for black subjects, who showed a large variability across LS mean treatment effects. However, when this interaction was examined more closely, the large increase in treatment effect was noted in the free combination, budesonide, and placebo arms. For these same subjects, the primary treatment group comparison of Symbicort HD versus formoterol was equivalent to the primary analysis. Therefore, it was concluded that there was no clear evidence of a differential treatment effect across race groups.</p><p>2) 1-hour Post-Dose FEV1 Similar patterns of results seen in the primary analysis were seen in the sensitivity analyses adjusting for sex and age groups. A statistically significant interaction was observed for race, particularly for black subjects, who showed a large variability across LS mean treatment effects.</p><p>Most notable was the large increase in 1-hour post-dose FEV1 for the free combination, budesonide, and placebo arms (LS means: 0.45L, 0.19L, and 0.28L, respectively), which was not consistent with primary results. For these same subjects, the primary treatment group comparison for Symbicort HD versus budesonide was 0.02L, which was also not consistent with the primary analysis. When the reason for this is further investigated, it appears that the inconsistency in the treatment effect is due to unexpected increase in the budesonide treatment group rather than a lack of effect in the Symbicort HD group, which was 0.20L. Results for subjects reporting "other" for race, show similar results to the primary analysis. SUN 1) Pre-Dose FEV1 Similar patterns of results seen in the primary analysis were seen in the sensitivity analyses adjusting for sex and age groups. A statistically significant interaction was observed for race (p=0.05), however this was deemed by the Applicant to be due to the large variability across race groups. Therefore, it was concluded that there was no clear evidence of a differential treatment effect across race groups.</p><p>2) 1-hour Post-Dose FEV1 Similar patterns of results seen in the primary analysis were seen in the sensitivity analyses adjusting for sex, age, and race groups. The serial FEV1 graphs above indicate that all Symbicort-containing treatment groups demonstrated bronchodilation at 5 minutes after dosing, compared with placebo, which reached a maximum between 2 and 3 hours, and was maintained over 12 hours. The response was present at the end of treatment as well. The serial FEV1 curves in the 12-month study differ in one notable way when compared with the 6 month study. In SUN, the formoterol treatment group did not have a sustained improvement in FEV1 compared to placebo over 12 hours. The reason for this finding is unclear given the curves in the 6-month study and that formoterol is approved as a twice-daily drug.</p><p>Reviewer's comment: Of note, the SHINE serial FEV1 curves are included by the Applicant in the proposed product label.</p><p>Morning and Evening PEF A Mini-Wright peak flow meter was dispensed at Visit 1.

The study consisted of an initial visit, a 2-week run-in period, 5 further visits during a 26-week treatment period, and a 4-week follow up telephone call. In SUN, patients were assigned to one of four treatment arms: Symbicort HD BID, Symbicort LD BID, formoterol 2 x 4.5 mcg BID, or placebo BID for a randomized treatment period of 52 weeks. The design was identical to that of SHINE, except that there were 7 visits over the longer treatment period. Efficacy was assessed via pulmonary function testing at each visit.</p><p>The co-primary efficacy endpoints in both studies were the change from baseline to endpoint in pre-dose FEV1, to demonstrate the anti-inflammatory contribution of budesonide, and 1-hr postdose FEV1, to demonstrate the bronchodilator contribution of formoterol, to the efficacy of the combination product, Symbicort. Each co-primary variable was calculated as an average over the randomized treatment period. In SUN and SHINE, the primary comparison for the pre-dose FEV1 endpoint was between each of the Symbicort groups and formoterol. In SHINE, the primary comparisons for the post-dose FEV1 endpoint was between each of the Symbicort groups and budesonide alone. For post-dose FEV1, results indicate that both dosage strengths of Symbicort demonstrated a statistically significantly greater increase from baseline when compared with budesonide. These results demonstrated that formoterol contributes to the efficacy of the combination product. These results were supported by the SUN study, however, this 12 month study did not include a budesonide group for comparison, so the primary comparison was between the Symbicort treatment groups and placebo. Symbicort HD showed superiority over formoterol for pre-dose FEV1 in both pivotal studies, demonstrating the contribution of the higher dose of budesonide to the efficacy of the combination product. Symbicort HD also showed superiority over budesonide in SHINE and over placebo in SUN for post-dose FEV1, demonstrating the contribution of formoterol to the efficacy of the combination product. Symbicort LD failed to show the contribution of the inhaled corticosteroid to the efficacy of the combination product.</p><p>Key secondary endpoints were defined by the Applicant as dyspnea (as measured by the Breathlessness Diary), the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and COPD exacerbations. COPD exacerbations, as defined by the applicant, occurred at a numerically lower rate in both pivotal studies. The SGRQ and Breathlessness Diary were also generally supportive of the efficacy of Symbicort. However, for various reasons, including failure to meet minimal clinically important differences, issues with the instrument, or concerns regarding endpoint definition, these key secondary variables Other secondary variables that were measured included serial FEV1 measurements, morning and evening peak expiratory flow (PEF), COPD symptoms (rescue medication use, cough, sputum, and sleep score. These secondary variables were generally supportive of the efficacy of Symbicort.</p><p>In conclusion, findings from two pivotal COPD studies (SUN and SHINE) support the efficacy of Symbicort HD therapy for the long-term treatment of airway obstruction in patients with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Safety was assessed in the two pivotal studies with reports of deaths, adverse events, laboratory values, vital signs, and physical exams. Equal emphasis was placed on each study throughout the course of this review. Additional safety information regarding effect on ophthalmologic exam, bone mineral density, and 24-hour Holter monitoring was provided in the SUN (12 month) study only. A total of 3668 subjects received randomized treatment in the two pivotal trials with 1546 patients receiving Symbicort: 1302 (84.2%) of these subjects were treated for at least 24 weeks and 720 subjects (46.6%) were treated for more than 50 weeks.</p><p>In general, analysis of the safety results revealed that Symbicort has a similar safety profile in patients with COPD as was known for asthma patients with the exception that COPD patients treated with Symbicort 160/4.5 had a greater incidence of lung infections other than pneumonia. The incidence of pneumonia was not increased in the Symbicort groups relative to the formoterol or placebo treatment arms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.1">Deaths</head><p>There were 26 deaths reported during the randomized treatment period in two pivotal trials: 6 in the Symbicort HD group, 10 in the Symbicort LD group, 2 in the budesonide group, 3 in the formoterol group, and 5 in the placebo group. No deaths were reported in the budesonide + formoterol co-administration group during the randomized treatment period. Nineteen of the 26 deaths were reported in the non-US regions, and 7 were reported in the US region. The most frequent reported SAE leading to death was COPD: 3 subjects in the Symbicort LD group and 1 subject in the budesonide group. All 4 deaths occurred due to COPD exacerbations. Other causes of death included cardiac and malignancy-related SAEs.</p><p>Overall, there were relatively few deaths in this study, considering the severity of COPD in the study population and the presence of co-morbid conditions. Review of the narratives and the causes of death did not suggest a particular safety signal.</p><p>Clinical Review Banu A. Karimi-Shah, MD NDA 21-929 SE005 Symbicort ®, Budesonide/Formoterol 46 Adverse events were collected by means of a standard question: "Have you had any health problems since the previous visit?" The question was put to each subject in the local language at the beginning of each visit, starting with Visit 2, but after completion of the SGRQ. The subject's response to this question and spontaneously reported and/or observed AEs were recorded in the CRF with information about seriousness, action taken, date of onset, stop date, maximum intensity, causality assessment and outcome. Subjects were provided with a diary card to record study variables. It was the investigator's responsibility to review the diary card with the subject and transfer any indications of AEs to the AE form.</p><p>COPD symptoms or signs such as bronchitis, cough, phlegm, increased sputum, dyspnea, and wheeze were defined in the clinical study protocol as disease under study events and were to be reported as adverse events if: the sign or symptom was serious according to definitions, the subject discontinued the study due to the sign or symptom, and/or the sign/symptom was new to the subject or not consistent with the subject's pre-existing COPD history, as judged by the investigator. Additional adverse events of interest, which were specific categories of interest potentially associated with ICS and/or beta-agonist medications were also tabulated. The following events of interest were defined:</p><p>• Events representing typical and potential steroid class effects, subcategorized as:</p><p>o Local effects: aphonia, dysphonia, oral candidiasis, and thrush o Systemic steroid effects: weight gain, adrenal suppression, ocular effects, skin effects, psychiatric disorders, diabetes control, thirst, taste effects, and bone effects o Pneumonia and potential lung infections other than pneumonia: due to findings in 2 recent studies (1-3) of the fluticasone/salmeterol combination in subjects with COPD that indicated a higher rate of pneumonia in all groups receiving ICS 7.1.5.2 Appropriateness of adverse event categorization and preferred terms</p><p>The nomenclature for reported clinical AEs was standardized using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 10 (i.e., the version used in SUN, the last study to report data during the clinical development program for COPD). AEs coded in earlier versions of MedDRA were recoded using MedDRA Version 10.</p></div>

The most commonly reported AEs (&gt;3%) were COPD, nasopharyngitis, oral candidiasis, bronchitis, sinusitis, viral upper respiratory tract infection, and pneumonia. All AEs with the exception of pneumonia, occurred with greater frequency in the Symbicort treatment groups compared to placebo. The number of subjects with oral candidiasis was higher in the Symbicort HD and LD groups compared to formoterol and Blood and urine samples for determination of hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis parameters were taken at baseline and endpoint. HPA-axis assessment was evaluated in a subset of patients from both the SUN and SHINE studies and is described in Section 7.1.12.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.7.3">Standard analyses and explorations of laboratory data</head><p>In each of the two Phase 3 studies (SUN and SHINE), there were no clinically relevant mean changes from baseline within the Symbicort groups or mean differences between treatment groups for hematology and other clinical chemistry assessments. Although some small differences were identified among treatment groups in the percentage of subjects with shifts from baseline using the potentially significant and significant range limits, there were no significant increases in the percentage of subjects with potentially significant or significant abnormalities in the Symbicort groups for hematology or any of the clinical chemistry assessments. There were small changes in mean serum glucose and potassium levels from baseline in each treatment group and small differences across treatment groups. The percentage of subjects with potentially significant or significant abnormalities relating to an increase in serum glucose or decrease in serum potassium was low and generally similar for Symbicort groups compared to its mono-products and to placebo. Urinalysis was performed in both Phase 3 studies. In these 2 studies, the percentage of subjects with abnormalities was generally low, with similar incidences noted across treatment groups. Bone Mineral Density Assessment A total of 326 patients from the SUN study had baseline and post-baseline BMD results and were included in the BMD analysis subset. Total lumbar spine BMD was the primary variable to be analyzed, while total hip BMD was the secondary variable. Mean baseline BMD values were similar across all treatment groups for each of the spine and hip regions. Mean changes in BMD from baseline to end of treatment were very close to zero for each of the treatment groups for both spine and hip regions (mean changes ranged from -0.01 to 0.01). ANCOVA results for total spine and total hip BMD based on the end of treatment time point showed that all geometric LS Mean ratios for the pairwise treatment group comparisons were close to 1. Statistically significant differences by ANCOVA were seen between Symbicort HD and each of the other treatment groups for total lumbar spine BMD, and between Symbicort HD and formoterol 4.5 for total hip BMD. However, the geometric LS Mean ratio was either 0.99 or 0.98 for these treatment group comparisons with a 95% confidence interval upper limit of 1.00.</p><p>No subjects in any treatment group presenting with a normal BMD T-score at baseline shifted to the osteoporosis category at the end of treatment for either the hip or spine regions. There were 14 subjects who had normal BMD T-scores at baseline (spine) who shifted to the osteopenia category and 11 subjects (hip) who shifted to the osteopenia category at end of treatment, and there were no treatment group differences. Additionally, there were 3 subjects with total hip BMD T-score shifts from the osteopenia category at baseline to the osteoporosis category at the end of treatment, and 9 subjects with total spine BMD T-score shifts from the osteopenia category at baseline to the osteoporosis category at the end of treatment. The numbers of subjects exhibiting categorical shifts were distributed similarly across the 4 treatment groups.</p><p>Bone mineral density results for total hip and total spine regions for the 12-month time point were similar to the end of treatment results presented above. Overall, across all treatment groups, bone mineral density for total hip and total spine regions for the 12 month time point were stable over the entire 1-year treatment period. , and posterior subcapsular (P)] along with intraocular pressure measurements were to be conducted at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Results for posterior subcapsular (P) only are presented here as the most accurate measure of lenticular opacification associated with the use of corticosteroids.</p><p>The LS mean change from baseline to end of treatment for posterior subcapsular and intraocular pressures were small for each treatment group. The ANCOVA results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 57</ref> showed a statistically significant difference in the treatment group LS Mean changes from baseline for Symbicort HD vs. Symbicort LD (p = 0.022). No other treatment group comparisons were statistically significant for posterior subcapsular or intraocular pressure.</p><p>In examining the shifts of individual patients from baseline to end of treatment, the percentage of patients with changes in IOP from ≥10 to ≤20 mm Hg at baseline to &gt;20 mm Hg at the end of treatment was highest in the Symbicort HD group (11%) and lowest in the Symbicort LD groups (3%). In the Symbicort HD group, 9 of the 13 subjects had actual intraocular pressure changes of ≤ 4 mm Hg. Overall, changes from 10 to 20 mmHg, inclusive, at baseline to &gt;20 mmHg at the end of randomized treatment in intraocular pressure considered clinically important (i.e. ≥5mmHg) were few and showed no association with a particular treatment.</p><p>There were 26 of 461 subjects (6%) with an increase in the posterior subcapsular score from baseline to the maximum value during the randomized treatment period of ≥0.7 (i.e. a worsening of 0.7 or more, a change of ≥0.7 is considered clinically important). Changes in posterior subcapsular scores of ≥0.7 from baseline to treatment maximum occurred more often in the Symbicort HD group (11 subjects, 9%), and least often in the Symbicort LD group (4 subjects, 4%). Results were similar for the end of treatment. Review of these subjects did not reveal any consistent commonalities among subjects exhibiting posterior subcapsular changes of ≥0.7. Twelve-lead ECGs were obtained pre-dose and 30 to 60 minutes after administration of the morning dose of study drug in all subjects in the Phase 3 studies. The timing of the post-dose measurements corresponds to the time of peak sustained pharmacodynamic effects of formoterol. Assessments were obtained at protocol-specified visits (baseline and Months 2 and 6 in SHINE, and baseline and Months 2, 6 and 12 in SUN). Change from baseline refers to changes from the last pre-dose value before the first dose of randomized study drug. In the two pivotal studies, there were 1544 Symbicort subjects assessed with 5028 ECGs performed during treatment. The number of ECGs per subject was similar for the Symbicort, formoterol, and placebo groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.9.4">Additional analyses and explorations</head><p>Mean changes in QRS and PR intervals from baseline were small, and not clinically meaningful. There were no clinically relevant treatment group differences when change from baseline was assessed for these parameters. Small increases from baseline in heart rate were noted at treatment maximum in all treatment groups. There were no significant differences in heart rate at treatment maximum across treatment groups. For QT, QTcB and QTcF, LS mean change from baseline at treatment maximum showed moderate increases across all treatment groups. There were some statistically significant between-group differences; however, these differences were small and not clinically meaningful.</p><p>Shift data analysis of the ECGs showed that the percentage of subjects with shifts from normal to abnormal at treatment maximum in the Symbicort treatment groups was slightly higher than placebo (16.7% vs. 12.3%.) and similar to formoterol (17.7%).</p><p>Assessment of outliers revealed that for QRS duration, the percentage of subjects who met change criteria of an increase of at least 30 msec from baseline or had values that crossed the extended reference range of &gt;120 msec (or both) was lowest in the placebo group, but was similar across all other treatment groups. For PR interval, the percentage of unique subjects who met change criteria of an increase of at least 40 msec from baseline or had values that crossed the extended reference range of &gt;220 msec (or both) at any time during the study was low and similar across all treatment groups. For heart rate, a similar percentage of subjects in the Symbicort HD group crossed the high threshold (&gt;100 bpm) or met the change criteria (increase of at least 20 bpm) relative to the formoterol 4.5 and placebo treatment groups. For QT, the percentage of subjects with potentially significant findings (values that crossed the high Clinical Review Banu A. Karimi-Shah, MD NDA 21-929 SE005 Symbicort ®, Budesonide/Formoterol 54 threshold [450 msec] or with changes ≥30 msec) was slightly higher in the Symbicort treatment groups compared to the formoterol 4.5 and placebo treatment groups, with the majority of subjects manifesting changes ≥30 msec. For QTcB, the percentage of subjects with potentially significant findings was similar across treatment groups and for QTcF, the percentage of subjects with potentially significant findings was slightly higher in all formoterol-containing treatment groups compared to placebo.</p><p>Overall, the ECG changes described are typical of the beta agonist class of medications, and are described in the current product label. These findings do not suggest a new safety signal.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.11">Human Carcinogenicity</head><p>Carcinogenicity was not formally assessed in this COPD efficacy supplement, but it was examined in the original clinical development program. Per the approved product label, in a 2year carcinogenicity study in Sprague Dawley rats, In a 2-year study in Sprague-Dawley rats, budesonide caused a statistically significant increase in the incidence of gliomas in male rats at an oral dose of 50 mcg/kg (less than the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mcg/m 2 basis). No tumorigenicity was seen in male and female rats at respective oral doses up to 25 and 50 mcg/kg (less than the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mcg/m 2 basis). In two additional 2-year studies in male Fischer and Sprague-Dawley rats, budesonide caused no gliomas at an oral dose of 50 mcg/kg (less than the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mcg/m 2 basis). However, in the male Sprague-Dawley rats, budesonide caused a statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular tumors at an oral dose of 50 mcg/kg (less than the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mcg/m 2 basis). The concurrent reference corticosteroids (prednisolone and triamcinolone acetonide) in these two studies showed similar findings.</p><p>In a 91-week study in mice, budesonide caused no treatment-related carcinogenicity at oral doses up to 200 mcg/kg (approximately equal to the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mcg/m 2 basis).</p><p>In a 24-month carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats, an increased incidence of mesovarian leiomyoma and uterine leiomyosarcoma were observed at the inhaled dose of 130 mcg/kg (approximately 60 times the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mcg/m 2 basis). No tumors were seen at 22 mcg/kg (approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mcg/m 2 basis). There were no case reports of overdose in COPD subjects in either of the pivotal phase 3 studies. Per the approved product label, Symbicort HD was tolerated for up to 12 months at doses up to twice the highest recommended daily dose. The potential for acute toxic effects following overdose with budesonide is low. If used at excessive doses for prolonged periods, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism may occur. Budesonide at five times the highest recommended dose (3200 mcg daily) administered to humans for 6 weeks caused a significant reduction in the plasma cortisol response. An overdose of formoterol would likely lead to an exaggeration of effects that are typical for beta-agonist medications. Formoterol was welltolerated at a delivered dose of 90 mcg/day over 3 hours in adult patients with acute bronchoconstriction and when given three times daily for a total dose of 54 mcg/day for 3 days to stable asthmatics. As of December 2007, the post-marketing experience for Symbicort has been estimated to be approximately treatment days. An overview of all post-marketing reports received by the applicant through December 31, 2007 revealed 372 reports (29 serious reports, 343 nonserious reports). Of the serious reports, there were a total of 52 serious events, which included bronchospasm, urticaria, asthma, cardio-respiratory arrest, dizziness, tachycardia, tremor, and vision blurred. There were 4 post-marketing reports of death. Three reports concerned patients ≥ 12 years of age (and in one case was ≥ 65 years and had received treatment for COPD). In one case, the patient was &lt; 12 years of age. The causes of death were severe asthma exacerbation, food aspiration, morphine toxicity, and GI hemorrhage. In summary, 3 of the 4 patients with a fatal outcome had asthma; the fourth patient had COPD. One of the 4 reports described a pediatric patient. In the 3 adult reports, alternative explanations for the patients deaths were identified.</p><p>The most frequently reported AEs occurred in the respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders system organ class. When analyzed by preferred term, the most frequently reported postmarketing AEs were tremor, palpitations, cough, headache, dyspnea, and feeling jittery. Of these symptoms, most are well known reactions associated with the use of inhaled beta-agonists, or are related to the underlying disease. Overall there is no information in the post-marketing database that identifies any new safety issues. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.3">Adequacy of Overall Clinical Experience</head><p>The study number, design, and duration are sufficient to assess the efficacy and safety of Symbicort in patients with COPD. Both studies were double-blind, randomized, and placebo controlled. All of the subjects had an appropriate diagnosis of COPD for at least 2 years and had been using inhaled corticosteroids for at least 30-60 days prior to Screening. Change in pre-dose and 1-hour post-dose FEV1, accepted measures to evaluate the efficacy ICS and beta agonists in COPD, respectively, were used as the co-primary efficacy variables. The statistical analysis was appropriate.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.6">Adequacy of Metabolic, Clearance, and Interaction Workup</head><p>These areas of evaluation were not necessary for this COPD efficacy supplement. There is one on-going Symbicort phase 3 study included in this 4-month safety update. Study D589CC00003 is a Phase 3B, 12-month, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, parallelgroup, multicenter exacerbation study of Symbicort HD, Symbicort LD, and formoterol in patients with COPD. As Study 00003 is ongoing, all safety data are preliminary in nature and still blinded to the treatment each subject received. Case report forms for fatal and non-fatal serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events are not included in this safety update. A total of 1200 subjects are planned for randomization into Study 0003; during the reporting period of this safety update, 588 COPD patients have been randomized. The mostcommonly reported post-enrollment adverse events (&gt;2% of subjects) were COPD, headache, bronchitis, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, and supper respiratory tract infection. These are similar to what was observed in the pivotal phase 3 trials submitted to support registration. The most commonly reported SAEs were COPD (42 events), pneumonia (20 events), bronchitis (3 events) and dyspnea (3 events). The reported SAEs are consistent with what has been reported during the clinical development program for COPD. There have been 12 deaths during the course of study 0003 thus far. Six of the twelve deaths were respiratory-related (including acute respiratory failure, emphysema, respiratory failure, COPD, COPD exacerbation, hospitalacquired pneumonia). The post-marketing AEs reported during the 4-month safety update period were consistent with the overall expected safety profile for inhaled beta-agonists, inhaled glucocorticoids, and/or were associated with the underlying disease. A search of the medical literature did not identify any new or relevant safety information in patients receiving Symbicort off-label for the treatment of COPD, bronchitis, or emphysema. In summary, there are no new safety signals noted in the 4-month safety update.  In seven COPD clinical studies analyzed by the Applicant for either Symbicort or Pulmicort, there were 4 (0.11%) deaths due to pneumonia, 58 (1.5%) pneumonia SAEs, and a total of 152 (4.0%) pneumonia AEs. The incidence of pneumonia in all cases was similar to or less than that of the placebo or non-ICS group. Overall, the incidence of pneumonia events was low, and there was no increased reporting rate of pneumonia events in patients treated with budesonide compared with patients that were not ICS treated. Because the reporting of lower respiratory tract infections were not handled consistently across studies, the Applicant cautions pooling of the results of these studies. However, per the Applicant's analysis, no obvious imbalance was detected in the incidence of LRTIs between budesonide and non-ICS treated patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Summary of Selected Drug-Related Adverse Events, Important Limitations of Data, and Conclusions</head><p>The adverse event profile of Symbicort has been characterized in asthmatic patients 12 years of age and older. These adverse events are listed in the currently approved product label and include nasopharyngitis, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngolaryngeal pain, sinusitis, influenza, back pain, nasal congestion, stomach discomfort, vomiting, and oral candidiasis.</p><p>In the COPD patient population, the adverse events occurring most commonly include nasopharyngitis, oral candidiasis, bronchitis, sinusitis, and viral upper respiratory tract infection. Known local AEs associated with inhaled corticosteroids, such as oral candidiasis, were seen with expected incidence in these studies. Pneumonia-related preferred terms and other lung infections were evaluated in both the pivotal studies due to recent findings in studies with salmeterol/fluticasone in subjects with COPD that indicated a higher rate of pneumonia in all groups receiving ICS. For pneumonia-related preferred terms, no clinically important differences were seen between treatment groups. However, when the incidence of "potential lung infections other than pneumonia" were evaluated, there was a higher incidence in those groups treated with budesonide as compared with placebo. In SUN, there was a numerical trend towards increased lung infections with higher doses of steroids.</p><p>Since market introduction in June 2007, subject exposure to Symbicort is estimated to be about subject treatment days as of the end of December 2007. During this period, a total of 52 serious events have been reported. The most frequently reported post-marketing serious adverse events included bronchospasm (3 cases), urticaria (3 cases), asthma, cardio-respiratory arrest, dizziness, tachycardia, tremor, and blurred vision (all in 2 cases). There were four postmarketing reports of death (status asthmaticus, choking/food aspiration, morphine toxicity, and GI bleed and cardiac ischemia) that occurred in patients that were intermittently on Symbicort, but alternative explanations for the patient's deaths were identified.</p><p>To summarize, "lung infections other than pneumonia", including events such as bronchitis, lower respiratory tract infection (viral and bacterial), may be a new safety signal noted with Symbicort in COPD patients. No other new safety concerns arose from the review of the data in COPD patients as compared with what has been reported in the Symbicort product label and other ICS/LABA combination products. Overall, there were no meaningful difference in adverse events with increasing doses of budesonide within the combination product, Symbicort.</p></div>

The study consisted of an initial visit, a 2 week-run in period, 5 further visits during a 26-week treatment period and a 4-week follow-up telephone call. Prior to Visit 1, fixed dose combination therapy was to be replaced with a comparable dose of ICS monotherapy and a short-acting inhaled B2 agonist. Patients using either long-acting beta agonists or anticholinergics were to be converted to a short-acting bronchodilator of the same class. Between Visits 1 and 2, patients were allowed to continue use of inhaled steroids and/or short-acting inhaled bronchodilators. At Visit 2, treatment with ICS was to be discontinued, and all eligible patients were randomized to receive one of the six study treatments listed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 11</ref>. In addition, at Visit 2, all patients will also be given albuterol/salbutamol pMDI rescue medication to be used as required for the relief of bronchospasm.

Secondary outcome variable: the change in mean total scores from Visit 2 to Visit 6.</p><p>The domain scores were to be handled in the same way.</p><p>• Diary cards: to be completed by the patient each day and reviewed by investigator at each visit. Variables recorded: 1. AM and PM PEF A Mini-Wright peak flow meter was dispensed at Visit 1. The patients were instructed to perform 3 maneuvers twice daily (morning and evening). The highest value on each occasion was to be recorded in the diary. The morning measurement was to be done immediately on rising; the evening measurement was to be done before going to be and prior to inhalation of the evening dose of study drug. The variable to be measured was change from baseline (mean over the last 10 days of the run-in period) to treatment (mean over all available measurements) in both morning and evening PEF.</p><p>2.

The content of the rating system is as follows: HOW MUCH DIFFICULT DID YOU HAVE BREATHING TODAY?  The variable to be calculated from this scale was the mean sputum score over the treatment period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Night time awakenings (prior to morning dose)</head><p>Patients were asked daily to evaluate night time awakenings caused by symptoms of COPD, including, but not limited to dyspnea, cough or chest tightness based on the following scale: HOW WAS YOUR SLEEP DURING THE NIGHT? 0 = Slept through the night 1 = Symptoms causing you to wake once or wake early 2 = Symptoms causing you to wake twice or more (including waking early) 3 = Symptoms causing you to wake most of the night 4 = Symptoms so severe that you did not sleep at all The variables to be calculated from this scale were the number and percentage of nights with at least one awakening as well as the number and percentage of symptom free nights </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exacerbations</head><p>Exacerbation was defined as worsening of COPD that at the discretion of the investigator requires a course of oral steroids for treatment and/or hospitalization. From the data regarding hospitalizations and oral corticosteroid use recorded on the diary cards, the following variables were to be derived/calculated:</p><p>• The number and percentage of patients with one or more exacerbations adjusting for the time that each patient is in the study. • The time to first exacerbation for all patients after Visit 2 from the date of first treatment until the start of the exacerbation. Patients who did not experience an exacerbation during the treatment period had the time to their first exacerbation censored at date of last dose. Patients who withdrew prematurely without experiencing an exacerbation, also had time to first exacerbation censored at the date of withdrawal. Patients known to have had an exacerbation but for whom there was no start date recorded, had their date of first exacerbation assumed to be the date of their previous clinic visit. • The duration of each exacerbation defined as the difference between the start and end date of exacerbation. Patients for whom there was no end date recorded had their date assumed as the date of their following clinic visit. • The number and percentage of COPD-related hospitalizations, the total number and percentage of steroid courses used for each patient, the number and percentage of patients taking at least one oral steroid course, and the man number of days on oral steroid/patient/year. Reviewer's comment: A COPD exacerbation as been defined solely on the basis of treatment with oral steroids and/or hospitalization.

The contribution of formoterol to the combination was to be accomplished by demonstrating a statistically significant difference between Symbicort and budesonide for 1-hour post-dose FEV1. The contribution of budesonide to the combination was to be assessed by demonstrating a statistically significant difference between Symbicort and formoterol for pre-dose FEV1. The efficacy analysis was to be performed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. All primary objectives were to be considered in a hierarchical manner. Each hypothesis was to be tested at the 5% level of (b) <ref type="bibr">(4)</ref> Clinical Review Banu A. Karimi-Shah, MD NDA 21-929 SE005 Symbicort ®, Budesonide/Formoterol 78 significance and each hypothesis test needs to be found to be significant at 5% level before continuing to the next.</p><p>This study had 2 primary variables, pre-dose FEV1 and 1 hour post-dose FEV1 to be compared with the monotherapies and placebo at the 2 dose levels of Symbicort. Therefore, to address multiplicity, each of the 4 comparisons versus the monotherapies was performed in hierarchical order and each must have been found to be statistically significant at the 5% level in order to move onto the next comparison and declare superiority of the drug. When testing for statistical significance, the higher dose of Symbicort was first compared with the monotherapies, followed by the lower dose.</p><p>The change in pre-dose and post-dose FEV1 from Visit 2 to the average value recorded during Visits 3 to 6 were analyzed using an ANCOVA model with treatment and country as fixed factors and the Visit 2 value as a covariate. Treatment effects were to be expressed as adjusted means. The possibility of treatment by country interaction was to be investigated for both primary efficacy variables separately by including the interaction in the model. A sensitivity analysis may also have been performed for FEV1 using the average of data from Visit 4 to 6 or, in cases of early withdrawals, the last available visit.</p><p>FEV1 at each visit and the change from baseline in FEV1 at each visit was to be summarized using standard summary statistics for both pre-and post-dose FEV1 separately. The mean FEV1 over the 6 month treatment period were to be calculated for each patient as the mean of available values and summarized along with the change from baseline in mean FEV1 by treatment group using standard summary statistics. The adjust means and 95% confidence intervals and p-values for the difference between treatments was to be presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary Efficacy Analysis</head><p>All secondary objectives were to be considered as supportive to the primary endpoints, and as such, no corrections of the significance level were planned to compensate for multiple statistical tests being performed for the secondary variables. For all secondary variables, nominal p-values were to be reported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs)</head><p>o SGRQ: Values averaged over the final 10 days preceding randomization were to serve as the patient's baseline value. The treatment period value was defined as the patient's average value of all days during the treatment period. The change from baseline to the last visit measurement on treatment for the 3 domains individually and the total score were analyzed with ANCOVA, with treatment and country as factors and the baseline score as a covariate. o Breathlessness Diary and Symptom Scores: Breathlessness Diary and symptom scores for cough, sputum and night-time awakenings will be recorded daily by the patient. Rescue medication use will also be recorded. Values averaged over the final 10 days preceding randomization will serve as a patient's baseline value. The treatment period value is defined as the patient's average value of all days during the treatment period. The change from baseline for all variables will be analyzed using </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Exacerbations</head><p>The number and percentage of patients with exacerbations and occurrences of exacerbations were to be tabulated. Differences in the number of exacerbations were compared using a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) assuming the data follows a Poisson distribution using the logarithmic link function, with treatment and country as factors and allowing for over deviance if appropriate. The time to first exacerbation was to be described using a Kaplan-Meier plot and analyzed using a long-rank test to compare the curves between treatment regimens. In the analysis, patients reporting no exacerbations will be censored to date of last dose, or if withdrawn, date of decision of study discontinuation.</p><p>• Serial FEV1 Serial FEV1 measurements were to be made on a subset of patients at Visit 2 and 3 to address onset of effect and assess the effect of Symbicort at 12 hours post-dose. Analysis of onset of effect was to be addressed by comparing the two Symbicort treatment groups with placebo at 5 minutes post-dosing. AUC was analyzed to address the overall effect during the 12 hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Peak Expiratory Flow</head><p>The change from baseline in morning and evening peak expiratory flow (mPEF, ePEF) was compared between treatment regimens by an analysis of covariance model (ANCOVA), with factors for treatment and country included in the model and using the baseline variable as a covariate. Baseline was defined as the average PEF over the 10 days immediately preceding randomization. The treatment period value was defined as the patient's average value of all days during the treatment period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Pharmacokinetic variables</head><p>The pharmacokinetic variables AUC(0-t) and Cmax for budesonide and formoterol were calculated for patients who provide samples for this purpose. These variables were summarized descriptively for each treatment group and compared between treatment groups, primarily through the use of confidence intervals, using analysis of variance techniques on log-transformed data. This was neither designed nor intended as a bioequivalence study, therefore there will be no decision rule associated with these data.</p></div>

This amendment clarified that albuterol CFC was used as an alternative to albuterol HFA for study rescue medication at US study cites (local amendment).</p><p>The statistical analysis plan dated March 1, 2007 contained the following modifications which were made prior to unlocking the study data:</p><p>• Definition of additional analysis sets: all randomized subjects, serial spirometry, PK, and urine cortisol • Clarification that the secondary variables were to be tested after each individual dose of study medication These baseline conditions were also well-balanced across treatment groups (Module 5, SHINE CSR, <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">Table 11</ref>.1.6, p. 833).</p><p>• Concomitant Medication Use The most common COPD medications were inhaled short-acting anticholinergic (ipratropium bromide), systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics, mucolytics, and oxygen, used by at least 5% of subjects during randomized treatment. The most common non-COPD medications were diuretics, platelet aggregation inhibitors (excluding heparin), ace inhibitors, antibiotics, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, proton pump inhibitors, and anilides, used by at least 5% of the randomized patient population. In general, use of the most common COPD medications during randomized treatment was similar across treatment groups.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Compliance</head><p>Study medication compliance was determined based on asking subjects twice daily as a part of diary entry whether they used their study medication. The number of "Yes" responses were used to calculate compliance in two ways. The first method was based on the number of "yes" responses to the study medication question from the diary relative to the expected number of study drug intakes based on the duration of the randomized treatment period for each subject. This method assumes that days the diary was not used were also days that the subject did not take study medication. The second method was calculated using the number of "Yes" responses to the study medication question from the diary relative to the total number of actual responses ("Yes" or "No") to the study medication question. Using both methods, study medication In terms of the pre-specified primary comparisons, results indicate that only Symbicort HD demonstrated a statistically significantly greater increase from baseline in pre-dose FEV1 when compared with formoterol. This result was consistent when analyzed as the average of the randomized treatment period or at the end of treatment.</p><p>Reviewer's Comment: It is of note that the difference between Symbicort HD and formoterol, though statistically significant, was quantitatively small, approximately 40 mL.</p><p>Symbicort LD failed to show the contribution of the inhaled corticosteroid to the efficacy of the combination product in both analyses. Both dosage strengths of Symbicort demonstrated statistically significant difference in pre-dose FEV1 vs. placebo when examined as the average of the randomized treatment period, but Symbicort LD was not statistically different from placebo at the end of treatment. In both analyses, Symbicort HD was not statistically different when compared with Symbicort LD in terms of change from baseline in pre-dose FEV1.</p><p>Reviewer's Comment: Based on the above analysis, the Sponsor has decided only to pursue the Symbicort high dose of 320/9 mcg BID for the COPD indication, as the lower dose failed to show the contribution of budesonide to the efficacy of the combination product.

The were a greater number of DAEs in the formoterol group (placebo 8.3%, formoterol, 11.3%, budesonide 9.1%, free combination 4.5%, Symbicort LD 6.8%, and Symbicort HD 6.9%). This was due to a greater number of adverse events related to COPD in the formoterol group (placebo 5%, formoterol 7.4%, budesonide 5.8%, free combination 4.5%, Symbicort LD 3.6%, and Symbicort HD 2.9%). Of note, there were 8 discontinuations due to respiratory infections, including pneumonia and other lung infections. These events are described by treatment group under "adverse events of interest" below; of note, the most discontinuations secondary to any of these respiratory tract infections were fairly evenly distributed among treatment groups. </p></div>

COPD was the most frequently reported AE, with the highest incidence in the formoterol group. The incidence of COPD was also slightly higher in the Symbicort HD group compared to placebo. Oral candidiasis occurred with greater incidence in the budesonide and Symbicort HD groups, consistent with the known effect of inhaled steroids. Additionally, bronchitis was noted with slightly higher incidence in the higher dose budesonide arms are compared with placebo. In each treatment group, most AEs were rated as mild or moderate in intensity. The distribution of severity grading was similar across treatment groups. COPD was the only adverse event that was reported by at least 1% of the subjects all treatment groups for which the percentage of subjects with a severe event represented more than 25% of the events.

The Applicant replied to the information request with the following tables as requested by this reviewer. From the data provided below, there were not significantly more DAEs due to either pneumonia or other lung infections when Symbicort treatment groups were compared to non-ICS treatment groups, however there were numerically more SAEs due to these adverse events of interest. This result was not seen in the 12 month study, and with such a small number of events, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions.

In each of the treatment arms, either adverse events or withdrawal of consent was the most likely reason for discontinuation. Of the 1704 patients randomized, 1378 patients completed the study, and a total of 326 patients discontinued There was a greater percentage of male than female subjects consistent with the disease prevalence in the target population. Most subjects were Caucasian, with fewer than 7% non-Caucasian patients. Approximately half of the subjects were over age 65, with approximately 12% of subjects over the age of 75 years. Baseline percent predicted FEV1, post-bronchodilator percent predicted FEV1, and smoking history (pack years) were well balanced across all treatment groups. Severity classification, based on the GOLD 2006 criteria applied to postbronchodilator FEV1 at Visit 1, indicated that approximately 80% of the study population had severe or very severe COPD, while 20% had moderate COPD at entry. In general, demographic and key baseline characteristics were similar across treatment groups and geographic regions (US vs. non-US).</p><p>The co-primary variables were change from baseline to endpoint in pre-dose FEV1, to demonstrate the anti-inflammatory contribution of budesonide, and post-dose FEV1, to demonstrate the bronchodilator contribution of formoterol, to the efficacy of the combination product, Symbicort. Each co-primary variable was calculated as an average over the randomized treatment period (primary analysis) and at the end-of-treatment. In terms of the prespecified primary comparisons, results indicate that only Symbicort HD demonstrated a statistically significantly greater increase from baseline in pre-dose FEV1 when compared with formoterol. This result was consistent when analyzed as the average of the randomized treatment period or at the end of treatment. Symbicort LD failed to show the contribution of the inhaled corticosteroid to the efficacy of the combination product in both analyses. Both dosage strengths of Symbicort demonstrated statistically significant difference in pre-dose FEV1 vs. placebo when examined as the average of the randomized treatment period, but Symbicort LD was not statistically different from placebo at the end of treatment. In both analyses, Symbicort HD was not statistically different when compared with Symbicort LD in terms of change from baseline in pre-dose FEV1. Symbicort HD demonstrated improvements in pre-dose FEV1 that were apparent at Month 1 and were generally maintained over the 6-month study period. These results demonstrate that the higher dose of budesonide makes a contributed to the efficacy of the combination product, however the lower dose does not.</p><p>For post-dose FEV1, results indicate that both dosage strengths of Symbicort demonstrated a statistically significantly greater increase from baseline in post-dose FEV1 when compared with Clinical Review Banu A. Karimi-Shah, MD NDA 21-929 SE005 Symbicort ®, Budesonide/Formoterol 110 budesonide. This result was consistent when analyzed as the average of the randomized treatment period or at the end of treatment. Both dosage strengths of Symbicort demonstrated statistically significant difference in post-dose FEV1 vs. placebo when examined as the average of the randomized treatment period and at the end of treatment. These results demonstrate that formoterol makes a contribution to the efficacy of both strengths of the combination product.</p><p>Dyspnea scores as measured by the Breathlessness Diary, SGRQ, and COPD exacerbations were defined as key secondary endpoints. For various reasons as stated in the review, the findings of these secondary endpoints are not supportive of the primary endpoints. Additional secondary endpoints, including spirometric and non-spirometric variables were also examined. Notably, serial FEV1 testing supported the 12 hour dosing interval in COPD patients, and a median time to 15% onset of bronchodilation of approximately 6 minutes for Symbicort HD. Of the other secondary efficacy variables, although some achieved statistical significance, their clinical significance in COPD remains unclear.</p><p>The extent of exposure was generally similar between the active treatment groups and placebo, and was satisfactory to allow for safety assessments. There were 11 deaths during the randomized treatment period, but their distribution or cause did not suggest a particular safety signal. The incidence of SAEs and DAEs were generally similar across treatment groups; the most common SAE and reason for discontinuation was COPD. The most common adverse events were bronchitis, COPD, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, oral candidiasis, and diarrhea. Examination of adverse events of interest with B2-agonists did not reveal any new safety signals or imbalances across treatment groups. No clinically meaningful changes in laboratory findings, ECGs, vital signs, or physical examination were noted.</p><p>Pneumonia-related preferred terms were evaluated due to recent findings in studies with salmeterol/fluticasone in subjects with COPD that indicated a higher rate of pneumonia in all groups receiving ICS. For pneumonia related preferred terms, no clinically important differences were seen with the overall incidence across the treatment groups ranging from 1.0% in the free combination group to 2.5% in the Symbicort LD group. There was no consistent effect in terms of dose-response for budesonide. However, when this data was added to "potential lung infections other than pneumonia", which contained preferred terms that could potentially represent lower respiratory tract infections other than pneumonia, there was a higher incidence in those groups treated with budesonide as compared with placebo. There was a numerical trend towards increased lung infections with higher doses of steroids (Symbicort HD 8.7%, Symbicort LD 5.7%).</p><p>To summarize, "lung infections other than pneumonia" may be a new safety signal noted with Symbicort and has been added to the product label by the Sponsor. No other new safety concerns arose from the review of the data in COPD patients as compared with what has been reported in the Symbicort product label and other ICS/LABA combination products. In conclusion, the SHINE study supports the safety and efficacy of Symbicort HD BID in the treatment of patients with COPD.

The study consisted of an initial visit, a 2 week-run in period, 7 further visits during a 52-week treatment period and a 4-week follow-up telephone call. Prior to Visit 1, fixed dose combination therapy was to be replaced with a comparable dose of ICS monotherapy and a short-acting inhaled B2 agonist. Patients using either long-acting beta agonists or anticholinergics were to be converted to a short-acting bronchodilator of the same class. Between Visits 1 and 2, patients were allowed to continue use of inhaled steroids and/or short-acting inhaled bronchodilators. At Visit 2, treatment with ICS was to be discontinued, and all eligible patients randomized to receive one of the six study treatments listed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 20</ref>. In addition, at Visit 2, all patients will also be given albuterol/salbutamol pMDI rescue medication to be used as required for the relief of bronchospasm.

Symbicort HD was not statistically different when compared with Symbicort LD in terms of change from baseline in pre-dose FEV1.</p><p>Reviewer's Comment: Based on the above analysis as well as the findings from the 6 month SHINE study, the Sponsor has decided only to pursue the Symbicort high dose of 320/9 mcg BID for the COPD indication, as the lower dose failed to show the contribution of budesonide to the efficacy of the combination product. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 21</ref> depicts the LS mean change from baseline in pre-dose FEV1 by visit. The accompanying table provides information for the number of subjects included in the analysis at each time point. Symbicort HD demonstrated improvements in pre-dose FEV1 that were apparent at Month 1 and were generally maintained over the 12-month study period. Symbicort HD demonstrated a statistically significantly greater increase from baseline in pre-dose FEV1 compared with placebo, but not formoterol at the end of treatment.   • Subgroup Analyses by Sex, Age, and Race 1) Pre-Dose FEV1 Similar patterns of results seen in the primary analysis were seen in the sensitivity analyses adjusting for sex and age groups. A statistically significant interaction was observed for race (p=0.05), however this was deemed by the Applicant to be due to the large variability across race groups. Therefore, it was concluded that there was no clear evidence of a differential treatment effect across race groups. The serial FEV1 graphs above indicate that both Symbicort treatment groups demonstrated bronchodilation at 5 minutes after dosing, compared with placebo, which reached a maximum between 2 and 3 hours, and was maintained over 12 hours.

Total lumbar spine BMD was the primary variable to be analyzed, while total hip BMD was the secondary variable. Mean baseline BMD values were similar across all treatment groups for each of the spine and hip regions. Mean changes in BMD from baseline to end of treatment were very close to zero for each of the treatment groups for both spine and hip regions (mean changes ranged from -0.01 to 0.01). ANCOVA results for total spine and total hip BMD based on the end of treatment time point showed that all geometric LS Mean ratios for the pairwise treatment group comparisons were close to 1. Statistically significant differences by ANCOVA were seen between Symbicort HD and each of the other treatment groups for total lumbar spine BMD, and between Symbicort HD and formoterol 4.5 for total hip BMD. However, the geometric LS Mean ratio was either 0.99 or 0.98 for these treatment group comparisons with a 95% confidence interval upper limit of 1.00.

In each of the treatment arms, either adverse events or withdrawal of consent was the most likely reason for discontinuation. Of the 1964 patients randomized, 1355 patients completed the study, and a total of 609 patients discontinued.</p><p>There was a greater percentage of male than female subjects consistent with the disease prevalence in the target population. Most subjects were Caucasian, with fewer than 8% non-Caucasian patients. Approximately half of the subjects were over age 65, with approximately 11% of subjects over the age of 75 years. Baseline percent predicted FEV1, post-bronchodilator percent predicted FEV1, and smoking history (pack years) were well balanced across all treatment groups. Severity classification, based on the GOLD 2006 criteria applied to postbronchodilator FEV1 at Visit 1, indicated that approximately 80% of the study population had severe or very severe COPD, while 20% had moderate COPD at entry. Severity varied somewhat across treatment groups, with approximately 30% more subjects in the most severe category in the Symbicort HD and formoterol groups. In general, demographic and key baseline characteristics were similar across treatment groups and geographic regions (US vs. non-US).</p><p>The co-primary variables were change from baseline in pre-dose FEV1, to demonstrate the antiinflammatory contribution of budesonide, and post-dose FEV1, to demonstrate the bronchodilator contribution of formoterol, to the efficacy of the combination product, Symbicort. Each co-primary variable was calculated as an average over the randomized treatment period (primary analysis) and at the end-of-treatment. In terms of the pre-specified primary comparisons, results indicate that only Symbicort HD demonstrated a statistically significantly greater increase from baseline in pre-dose FEV1 when compared with formoterol. However, this result was not consistent when analyzed at the end of treatment. Symbicort LD failed to show the contribution of the inhaled corticosteroid to the efficacy of the combination product in both analyses. Both dosage strengths of Symbicort demonstrated statistically significant difference in pre-dose FEV1 vs. placebo when examined as the average of the randomized treatment period and at the end of treatment. Symbicort HD was not statistically different when compared with Symbicort LD in terms of change from baseline in pre-dose FEV1. These results demonstrate that the higher dose of budesonide makes a contribution to the efficacy of the combination product, however the lower dose does not.</p><p>For post-dose FEV1, results indicate that both dosage strengths of Symbicort demonstrated a statistically significantly greater increase from baseline in post-dose FEV1 when compared with placebo.

Karimi-Shah, MD NDA 21-929 SE005 Symbicort ®, Budesonide/Formoterol 151 in this 12 month study, however the definition of COPD exacerbations was inadequate. Additional secondary endpoints, including spirometric and non-spirometric variables, were also examined. Notably, serial FEV1 testing supported the 12 hour dosing interval in COPD patients, and a median time to 15% onset of bronchodilation of approximately 5 minutes for Symbicort HD. Of the other secondary efficacy variables, although some achieved statistical significance, their clinical significance in COPD remains unclear.</p><p>The extent of exposure was generally similar between the active treatment groups and placebo, and was satisfactory to allow for safety assessments. There were 15 deaths during the randomized treatment period, but their distribution or cause did not suggest a particular safety signal. The incidence of SAEs and DAEs were generally similar across treatment groups. The most common adverse events were COPD, bronchitis, nasopharyngitis, oral candidiasis, and upper respiratory tract infection. Examination of adverse events of interest with B2-agonists did not reveal any new safety signals or imbalances across treatment groups. No clinically meaningful changes in laboratory findings, ECGs, vital signs, or physical examination were noted.</p><p>Pneumonia-related preferred terms were evaluated due to recent findings in studies with salmeterol/fluticasone in subjects with COPD that indicated a higher rate of pneumonia in all groups receiving ICS. For pneumonia-related preferred terms, no clinically important differences were seen with the overall incidence across the treatment groups ranging from 3.4% in the Symbicort LD and formoterol groups, to 5.0% in the placebo group. There was no consistent effect in terms of dose-response for budesonide. However, when this data was added to "potential lung infections other than pneumonia", which contained preferred terms that could potentially represent lower respiratory tract infections other than pneumonia, there was a higher incidence in those groups treated with budesonide as compared with placebo (6.9%-8.1% vs. 6.2%). There was a numerical trend towards increased lung infections with higher doses of steroids (Symbicort HD 11.3%, Symbicort LD 9.7%).</p><p>Bone mineral density measurements and ophthalmologic examination were conducted in a subset of patients in this 12-month study. Overall, there were no clinically important changes in bone mineral density and ophthalmologic findings over the 12 month treatment period.</p><p>To summarize, "lung infections other than pneumonia" may be a new safety signal noted with Symbicort and has been added to the product label by the Sponsor. No other new safety concerns arose from the review of the data in COPD patients as compared with what has been previously reported in the Symbicort product label and other ICS/LABA combination products.</p><p>In conclusion, the SUN study supports the safety and efficacy of Symbicort HD BID in the treatment of patients with COPD.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I.</head><p>General Information Symbicort is a fixed dose combination of the corticosteroid budesonide and the long-acting beta-agonist formoterol in a pressurized metered dose inhaler (MDI) using HFA 227 as the propellant. Symbicort is currently approved for the long-term maintenance treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older. There are two dose strengths that are currently marketed: 80/4.5 mcg (budesonide/formoterol) and 160/4.5 mcg. The approved doses for asthma patients range from 160/9 mcg administered twice daily to 320/9 mcg administered twice daily, depending on asthma severity and prior inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use. Each of the doses is administered with two actuations of either device, respectively. This submission is an efficacy supplement to NDA 21-929 in which the Applicant seeks to add the indication for the maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Regulatory History</head><p>The sponsor originally submitted NDA 21-929 for Symbicort pMDI on September 23, 2005. This NDA was given an Approval action on July 21, 2006 in the first review cycle. An Endof-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting was held in April 2004 to discuss the COPD development program. Key issues and recommendations from the EOP2 meeting are listed below:</p><p>• The Division suggested that a formoterol mono-comparator group be included in the 12 month study (D5899C00001) so that the combination rule could be addressed in both pivotal studies. • The Division suggested the inclusion of a group to receive the free combination of budesonide and formoterol in the 6 month study (D5899C00002) to address pharmaceutical effects.</p><p>(b) <ref type="bibr">(4)</ref> • Based on preliminary review of study SD-039-0729, the Division agreed with the use of the OXIS TBH (Formoterol DPI) as the formoterol mono-comparator. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. Clinical Studies The clinical program in COPD includes five studies:</head><p>The clinical development program in COPD consists of 5 studies: 2 Phase 1 bioavailability studies (SD-039-0738 and D5899C00006), 1 Phase 2 pharmacodynamic study (D5899C00748), and 2 Phase 3A efficacy and safety studies (D5899C00001 and D5899C00002). The proposed indication was evaluated in the two clinical studies as shown above. With the exception of trial duration, the study methodology, subject populations, inclusion/exclusion criteria, efficacy assessments, primary and secondary efficacy variables, and statistical analysis were the same for both pivotal studies (See <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">Table 1</ref>). Subjects enrolled in these trials were ≥ 40 years of age, of either sex, with a FEV1 ≤ 50% of predicted normal value prebronchodilator and an FEV1/FVC &lt; 70% predicted. The patients had a diagnosis of COPD with symptoms for &gt; 2 years and were current or previous smokers with a smoking history of ≥ 10 years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy:</head><p>The primary efficacy endpoints in these studies were the change from baseline to treatment (mean over the treatment period) in pre-dose FEV1 and 1 hour post-dose FEV1. Key secondary endpoints included Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score, Breathlessness Diary Score, and number of exacerbations.</p><p>A summary of the primary efficacy endpoints as analyzed by the Sponsor are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> below.</p><p>Reviewer's Comment: Based on the above analysis, the Sponsor has decided only to pursue the high dose of 320/9 mcg BID for the COPD indication, as the lower dose failed to show the contribution of budesonide when the combination was compared with formoterol in both studies.</p><p>Reviewer's Comment: In this reviewer's preliminary look at the sponsor's data, it appears that there is a discrepancy in the primary efficacy variables if the effect is analyzed at the end of treatment. Although the pre-specified analysis was as stated above, the average over the treatment period, the sponsor has also conducted an analysis of the primary endpoints at the end of treatment (EOT). In this analysis, the Sponsor found that the comparison of Symbicort HD with formoterol at EOT DID NOT demonstrate the contribution of the budesonide component as measured by pre-dose FEV1. The fact that both analyses do not yield the same result raises some concern, and will be a review issue.</p><p>Reviewer's Comment: It is of note that budesonide did not beat placebo in terms of pre-dose FEV1 in either study. Generally, the validity of the mono-comparators depends upon their ability to be better than placebo, thereby allowing for a comparison with the combination product to show the contribution of the other component. However, in this case, steroids are not known to have a robust response in COPD, so it is difficult to interpret these data in the general sense. This will be a review issue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Post-Dose FEV1</head><p>This primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the change from baseline to treatment (mean over the treatment period) in FEV1 one hour post-dose. The primary comparison in this analysis was between Symbicort and budesonide, to address the contribution of formoterol, the LABA. In Study 0001, the primary comparison was between Symbicort and placebo, as there was no budesonide arm included in this study.</p><p>Pertinent results for post-dose FEV1 comparisons from baseline averaged over the randomized treatment period for both Studies 0001 and 0002 indicated the following:</p><p>• Symbicort LD and HD demonstrated a statistically significant increase from baseline in 1-hour post-dose FEV1 compared with budesonide in Study 0002, and compared with placebo in both studies, thus demonstrating the contribution of formoterol to the improvement in post-dose lung function.</p></div>

Both Studies SUN and SHINE showed that Symbicort 160/4.5 satisfy the combination rules for efficacy evaluation. That is, Symbicort 160/4.5 had statistically significantly greater improvement compared with formoterol 4.5 μg in predose FEV 1 and greater improvement compared with placebo in 1-hour postdose FEV 1 . However, both studies showed that the contribution of budesonide in Symbicort in predose was only about 40 ml better than formoterol. Budesonide's contribution was also seen in 1-hour postdose FEV 1 , about 30 ml better than formoterol. Such small extra benefit raised a concern on whether the additional treatment benefit of the combination therapy in comparison to the formoterol monotherapy is clinically meaningful in COPD patients. The 80/4.5 dosing regimen of Symbicort failed to satisfy the combination rule in both studies because of smaller treatment effect. • Three key secondary efficacy variables were evaluated in the two phase 3 studies.</p><p>They are the number of COPD exacerbations, total SGRQ score, and dyspnea score.

The median onset time was shown to be 5 minutes and 15 minutes in Studies SUN and SHINE, respectively. • The overall dropout rates in the two studies were about 30% in Study <ref type="bibr">SUN and 19%</ref> in Study SHINE. The higher dropout rate in Study SUN was due to the longer study duration in comparison to Study SHINE. In both studies, the placebo groups had the highest dropout rates, about 37% and 26% in Studies SUN and SHINE, respectively. The two Symbicort 160/4.5 dosing regimens had about 10% less dropout rates than the placebo groups in both studies. In both studies, the dropout rates in US sites were alarmingly high, 44% in Study SUN and 29% in Study SHINE. In both studies, US sites enrolled above 40% of all the patients. Although subgroup analyses suggested that treatment differences in US and non-US regions are similar, the robustness of the efficacy is a concern due to the high dropout rate. • In the two Phase 3 studies, testing procedures were placed in the protocols to protect type I error. These procedures placed in each individual study are not useful in efficacy evaluation when evidence is assessed collectively from both studies. For the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of Symbicort, we look at analyses of both dosing regimens of Symbicort from both studies for both the primary and secondary endpoints. The evidence collectively indicates that Symbicort, as a combination production, provides additional benefit compared with the monotherapies, and the add-on benefit reaches statistically significance for Symbicort 160/4.5, although it is not clear if the size of the extra-benefit is clinically meaningful. Such evaluation can properly control the error rate of wrongly approving an ineffective drug, as well as identify relatively optimal dosing regimen among studied dosing regimens. Once the efficacy of the drug is established, from the secondary endpoints should depend upon the clinical importance of the secondary endpoints and the evidence obtained from both studies.</p></div>

The studies were randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel group studies designed to assess the efficacy and safety of Symbicort 160/4.5 and 80/4.5 in patients 40+ years of age with COPD.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1 Data path</head><p>The data submitted in SAS v.5 transport format were converted to SAS v.9 data for statistical analyses.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Blinding</head><p>To maintain the double-dummy blinding of study medication, patients randomized to active treatment delivered by a pMDI device (Symbicort pMDI) also received placebo delivered by a TBH device; and subjects randomized to active treatment delivered by a TBH device (formoterol) also received placebo delivered by a pMDI device. Subjects randomized to placebo received placebo pMDI plus placebo TBH.</p><p>The co-primary efficacy variables were:</p><p>• Predose FEV 1 : It was used to demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effect of Symbicort, largely contributed by the budesonide component. It was expected that Symbicort would be statistically more efficacious than placebo and formoterol alone in this variable. • One-hour postdose FEV1: It was used to demonstrate the bronchodilatory effect of Symbicort. It was expected that Symbicort would be statistically more efficacious than placebo.</p><p>Baseline, same for both predose and one-hour postdose FEV 1 , was defined as the last available predose FEV 1 value measured prior to the first dose of randomized treatment. The analyses of the co-primary efficacy variables were based on the change from baseline to the average of the randomized treatment period.</p><p>The key secondary efficacy variables included:</p><p>1. Dyspnea from the Breathlessness Diary data. Patients were asked daily to evaluate their breathlessness on a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating a more severe manifestation of the symptom. The analysis of dyspnea was based on the change from baseline to the average score over the randomized treatment period (with no imputation for missing data). The baseline was defined as the mean score of the last 10 days of the run-in period, excluding Day 1. 2. SGRQ total score. The SGRQ consists of 3 domains: symptoms, activities, and impacts. Together, they comprise the total SGRQ score. The analysis of total SGRQ was based on the change from baseline to the end of the treatment period. The baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the first dose of randomized treatment.</p></div>

If a subject did not show a 15% improvement within 60 minutes, the data for the time to onset of effect analysis was censored at 60 minutes. If a subject discontinued serial spirometry before showing an improvement, the subject was censored at the last available timepoint. Each subject was categorized as improving within ≤5 minutes, ≤15 minutes, ≤30 minutes, ≤60 minutes, or as showing no improvement. The 15% improvement in FEV1 at the other serial spirometry visits was also calculated in the same fashion.</p></div>

In the second paragraph of Sec. 14, the total number of patients in both studies should be corrected to exclude the 7 non-ITT patients. The correct number of patients should be 3661. • The analyses of the co-primary efficacy variables were based on the absolute change in pre-dose and 1-hour post dose FEV 1 from baseline to the average of the double-blind treatment period. However, the graphs and statements in the proposed label used the percent change instead. Modify the label so that it is consistent with the analyses of the primary efficacy variables. • If the time of onset-of-action for the COPD indication needs to be included in the label, the median time to a 15% increase from baseline in FEV 1 at the day of randomization is 15 minutes rather than 5 minutes in the proposed label.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Background</head><p>Symbicort pMDI is a combination inhaled product containing budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate (hereafter referred to as formoterol). Budesonide is a potent topical glucocorticosteroid and formoterol is a long-acting β2-agonist (LABA). Symbicort pMDI is administered by oral inhalation. Symbicort pMDI received approval from the FDA on 21 July 2006 for the long-term maintenance treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older.</p><p>The objective of this sNDA is to provide data supporting an indication for the maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Two formulation strengths of Symbicort pMDI were evaluated in the COPD clinical development program: 80/4.5 mcg per actuation and160/4.5 mcg per actuation, each administered as 2 actuations per dose. These strengths correspond to doses of 160/9 mcg, and 320/9 mcg, respectively, each administered on a bid regimen. However, the sponsor is only seeking approval of the higher strength (160/4.5 mcg with daily dose of 640/18 mcg) in the COPD patient population.</p><p>The formulation of Symbicort pMDI used in the COPD clinical development program is identical to the commercially available product and also to that used in the asthma program. As a result of the extensive characterization of the PK of Symbicort pMDI in the asthma clinical program, the clinical pharmacology plan specific to the COPD indication was limited in scope.</p><p>The primary objective of the clinical pharmacology program in this supplement was to provide data on the PK profile of budesonide and formoterol delivered via Symbicort pMDI in subjects with COPD. This was achieved through extensive 12-hour post-dose plasma PK sampling in a subset of patients during the Phase 3 efficacy and safety study (D5899C00002 -SHINE). An assessment of PK of budesonide and formoterol was also obtained in a Phase I relative BA study (study D5899C00006 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Comments to the Medical Team</head><p>• Budesonide exposure from Symbicort pMDI is comparable to that from budesonide pMDI alone and coadministration of monoproducts i.e. budesonide pMDI and formoterol via a dry powder inhaler (OXIS Turbuhaler, OXIS TBH, Form TBH).</p><p>• Formoterol exposure (AUC) from Symbicort160/4.5 mcg was consistently about 16-18% higher compared to individual products administered together, indicating a slight formulation effect.</p><p>• Budesonide appears to have a small effect (~12% increase in AUC) on formoterol exposure while on the other hand there was lack of any measurable effect on budesonide exposure in the presence of formoterol.</p><p>• Formoterol exposure (AUC) from Symbicort 160/4.5 mcg was about 30% higher compared to the formoterol monoproduct OXIS TBH 4.5 mg, which appears to be the consequence of summation of a small drug-drug interaction effect and a small formulation effect.</p><p>• Budesonide as well as formoterol systemic exposure (AUC) in COPD patients appear to be about 12-16% higher compared to asthma patients.</p><p>• Two actuations of Symbicort pMDI 160/4.5 mcg exhibited statistically significant (~30%) suppression of 24h-UFC levels following chronic twice daily inhalation administration in COPD patients relative to placebo.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Summary of Clinical Pharmacology Findings Formulation Effect</head><p>Formulation effect was initially evaluated in an open-label, randomized, 2-way crossover study (D5899C00006) that determined the relative bioavailability (BA) of budesonide and formoterol when administered as Symbicort pMDI versus the monoproducts administered concurrently in subjects with COPD. Twenty-six (26) male and female subjects with COPD (mean age 53 years) participated in the study. The two orally inhaled treatments were 1) Symbicort pMDI (80/4.5 µg x 12 actuations, total dose 960/54 µg), and 2) budesonide pMDI (80 µg x 12 actuations, total dose 960 µg) plus OXIS TBH (4.5 µg x 12 inhalations, total dose 54 µg).</p><p>Study D5899C00002 (SHINE) was the pivotal safety and efficacy study which included PK assessments during steady-state administration of Symbicort pMDI and the monoproducts. The doses tested in this study were the proposed clinical doses of 2 inhalations twice daily in a parallel group design.</p><p>Despite the differences in study designs, the results of the two studies were quite similar with respect to the relative bioavailability between Symbicort pMDI and the monoproducts. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">Table 1</ref>, in the single-dose study, systemic exposure of budesonide was found to be nearly identical between the treatment arms while the steady state comparison showed slightly higher exposure to budesonide (8-12%) from Symbicort® compared to two monoproducts administered together. For formoterol, <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> shows higher exposure (18-22%) from Symbicort compared to two monoproducts coadministered. This has been confirmed from the comparative PK data from the SHINE study where about 12-16% higher exposure of formoterol was observed with Symbicort® compared to two drugs given together. These results indicate a lack of any appreciable formulation effect for budesonide while demonstrating a small formulation effect for formoterol when delivered through the pMDI device.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Drug-Drug Interaction</head><p>Evaluation of drug-drug interaction came from the pharmacokinetic data from SHINE study. Systemic exposure of budesonide and formoterol from two individual drugs administered together compared to single ingredient administered alone, reflect the impact of drug-drug interaction on the systemic exposure of these drugs when combined together. As shown in SHINE study <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">(Table 3)</ref>, budesonide did have a small effect on formoterol exposure while there was lack of any measurable effect on budesonide exposure in the presence of formoterol. Formoterol AUC was shown to be 12% greater in combination (budesonide 160 mcg and formoterol 4.5 mcg) compared to formoterol 4.5 mcg alone while formoterol C max remained unchanged between the two treatment arms. For Budesonide, both C max and AUC remained nearly identical between the combination and budesonide alone. Comparisons of systemic exposure of budesonide and formoterol from Symbicort with individual monoproducts administered alone reflect the sum of formulation and drugdrug interaction effects. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 4</ref>, about 11-12% higher systemic exposure for budesonide (AUC as well as C max ) was observed with Symbicort compared to budesonide alone administration. This is similar to 8-12% formulation effect seen with budesonide <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">(Table 1)</ref>, confirming a lack of drug-drug interaction effect beyond a small formulation effect.</p><p>For formoterol, about 30% and 13% higher AUC 0-12h and C max , respectively, was observed with Symbicort compared to formoterol alone administration. As indicated in Tables 2 and 4, it appears that the increase in formoterol exposure (AUC) in the presence of budesonide is slightly greater than that can be accounted for by the formulation effect (30% vs. 16%), indicating a small drug-drug interaction effect based on AUC. On the other hand, 13% formoterol C max increase <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">(Table 3</ref>) from Symbicort is in line with about 12% increase seen due to the formulation effect <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 2</ref>), suggesting no drug-drug interaction with respect to C max . </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Systemic exposure in COPD vs Asthma patients</head><p>Results from the statistical analyses of pharmacokinetic parameters for budesonide in COPD vs. asthma patients are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 5</ref>. Mean AUC 0-∞ and AUC 0-t were 12% higher whereas mean C max was 10% lower in COPD patients compared with asthma patients. Mean T 1/2 , median T max and mean MRT were all longer in COPD patients than in asthma patients. longer in COPD patients than in asthma patients while T max remained unchanged between the two patient populations. Budesonide is approved in the US for the treatment of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and Crohn's disease. Formoterol is available in the US as Foradil® Aerolizer® (Novartis) for the maintenance treatment of asthma and COPD. Formoterol is also available outside the US in the form of OXIS ® TURBUHALER ® (TBH), which has been on the market since 1996 and is approved in 79 countries as of 17 June 2007. The OXIS TBH was used as an active formoterol comparator in the pivotal safety and efficacy studies (SUN and SHINE) in the COPD development program. The formulation of Symbicort pMDI used in the COPD clinical development program is identical to the commercially available product and also to that used in the asthma program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">What are the proposed mechanism of action and therapeutic indications?</head><p>Symbicort pMDI contains budesonide and formoterol fumarate dehydrate in a pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI). Budesonide is a potent topical glucocorticosteroid and formoterol is a long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA) with a rapid onset of action.</p><p>Current treatment options for COPD patients primarily include bronchodilators (shortacting and long-acting β 2 -agonists, anticholinergics and xanthines) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), many of which are taken in combination such as ADVAIR DISKUS, a combination of an ICS (fluticasone propionate) and a long-acting β 2 -agonist (salmeterol) in a dry powder inhaler. Literature data suggest that LABAs improve lung function, reduce symptoms such as dyspnea, decrease the need for rescue medication, and improve exercise tolerance and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with COPD. Treatment with an ICS such as budesonide or fluticasone has shown benefit to patients with COPD through improvements in symptoms and HRQL, and decreased frequency of exacerbation. Therefore, treatment of severe COPD with the combination of a LABA and an ICS is now a well-established and accepted part of current clinical practice.</p><p>In the current submission, the applicant is seeking the following indication for Symbicort pMDI: maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. This is in addition to the asthma indication for which it was already approved in 2006.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">What are the proposed dosage(s) and route(s) of administration?</head><p>The proposed route of administration is by oral inhalation.</p><p>For COPD patients, the proposed dose is Symbicort 160/4.5, two inhalations twice daily for a total daily dose of Budesonide/Formoterol 640/18 mcg.</p><p>For asthma patients, Symbicort pMDI is already approved with the following dosage recommendations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">General Clinical Pharmacology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">What clinical studies were submitted in this NDA?</head><p>The Symbicort pMDI COPD clinical program consisted of 2 Phase 1 relative bioavailability (BA) studies (SD-039-0738 and D5899C00006), 1 Phase 2 pharmacodynamic (PD) study (D5899C00748), and 2 Phase 3 confirmatory efficacy and safety studies (D5899C00002 [SUN] and D5899C00002 <ref type="bibr">[SHINE]</ref>). In addition, study SHINE involved an extensive 12-hour PK blood sampling in a sub-set of COPD patients. The data from the Phase 1 study SD-039-0738 were considered unreliable due to some (b) <ref type="bibr">(4)</ref> technical issues and hence will not be included in any further discussion in this review. Study D5899C00006 is considered the definitive relative BA study. Study D5899C00748 was designed to evaluate onset of bronchodilation in COPD patients within the first 180 minutes. Refer to medical officer's review for a review of this study.</p><p>The Phase 1 program was designed with the primary goal to evaluate the relative BA of budesonide and formoterol in COPD patients when given as either Symbicort MDI or as a combination of the monoproducts used as active comparators in the Phase 3 safety/efficacy studies, i.e., budesonide pMDI and OXIS TBH. Formulation effect in COPD patients, if any, can be evaluated by this comparison. A secondary goal was to compare the bioavailability of budesonide and formoterol from Symbicort pMDI in patients with COPD versus patients with asthma.</p><p>The PK analysis in SHINE study was designed to assess the systemic exposure to budesonide and formoterol following administration of Symbicort pMDI 80/4.5 µg, Symbicort pMDI 160/4.5 µg, budesonide HFA pMDI 160 µg and OXIS TBH 4.5 µg (when taken together and separately), each administered as 2 inhalations bid, by measuring plasma concentrations over 12 hours at steady state. This allows for the evaluation of drug-drug interaction as well as formulation effect at steady state for both the active drugs.</p><p>Bioequivalence studies were not considered necessary within this development program since there have been no changes to the formulation used in the COPD program from the approved product.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">What are the PK characteristics of budesonide and formoterol when delivered via Symbicort pMDI?</head><p>The single-dose mean plasma concentration-time profiles of budesonide (960 mcg) and formoterol (54 mcg) are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figures 1 and 2</ref>  The steady-state mean plasma concentration-time profiles of budesonide (320 mcg bid) and formoterol (9 mcg bid) are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_30">Figures 3 and 4</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_48">Figure 3</ref>). Following administration of the same dose of formoterol from Symbicort 160/4.5 mcg and 80/4.5 mcg, formoterol plasma concentration-time profiles indicate similar systemic exposure. However, the same dose of formoterol from formoterol 4.5 mcg alone and budesonide 160 mcg plus formoterol 4.5 mcg resulted in slightly lower exposure compared to Symbicort treatments as indicated by the formoterol profiles <ref type="figure" target="#fig_30">(Figure 4)</ref>.  Budesonide systemic exposure increased dose proportionally following multiple-dose administration of 160 mcg to 320 mcg twice daily as evident from dose-corrected AUC 0-12h and C max values listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_86">Table 7</ref>. For budesonide, T max occurred at 20 to 40 minutes post-dose after both single and multiple dose administration. For formoterol, T max occurred at 15 minutes following single dose administration but was between 40 and 60 minutes at steady-state in the SHINE study. This delayed T max under steady-state is a significant deviation from the historical data included in the asthma label. Although PK sampling between the two studies was not identical, sampling was carried out for earlier timepoints of 10 and 20 minutes post-dose in the SHINE study, therefore this observation could not be blamed on the frequency of PK blood sampling immediately after dosing in the SHINE study.</p><p>As has been known from the approved Symbicort pMDI label for asthma and also consistent with the half-life values of the two drugs, budesonide and formoterol are expected to accumulate following multiple-dose twice daily administration. Based on half-life estimates from the single-dose study, formoterol was expected to accumulate more than budesonide. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_86">Tables 7 and 8</ref>, cross-study comparison of dose corrected AUC 0-12h and C max values for budesonide showed an accumulation of approximately 1.55, generally consistent with its half-life estimate of 5.3 hours, while for formoterol, the data indicated a lack of any appreciable accumulation contrary to the halflife estimate of 9.2 hours. Caution should be exercised in interpreting this data particularly due to lack of dose-proportionality information at supra-therapeutic dose of budesonide/formoterol 960/54 mcg. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">What efficacy and safety information contribute to the assessment of clinical pharmacology study data?</head><p>The primary efficacy variable in the pivotal efficacy studies was the change from baseline in average pre-dose and 1-hour post-dose FEV 1 (forced expiratory volume in one second) over the treatment period. Since systemic absorption of inhaled drugs is the result of pulmonary and gastrointestinal absorption, and because there is uncertainty about the site of absorption along the respiratory tract/airways, plasma concentrations cannot be correlated to efficacy (FEV1).</p><p>One of the major systemic side effects of therapeutic corticosteroids is the suppression of endogenous cortisol production. In the case of topical corticosteroid therapy such as in the lungs, the goal has always been to minimize the systemic contribution by the absorbed corticosteroids in favor of primarily local effects. In this case, the suppression of endogenous cortisol release (HPA-axis function) assessed by cortisol concentration measurements (plasma and/or urine) is a suitable marker to quantify the degree of systemic steroid burden of a drug in the target patient population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4">What are the results of the assessment of HPA-axis function following administration of Symbicort pMDI in COPD patients?</head><p>HPA-axis function in COPD patients was assessed by measuring 24-hour urinary free cortisol (24h-UFC) in a subgroup of subjects in both SUN (179 subjects) and SHINE (437 subjects). In both studies, 24-hour urine specimens were collected at baseline (prior to randomization), at Month 6 (SUN and SHINE), and at Month 12 (SUN). Urine samples were analyzed for urinary free cortisol and creatinine. Creatinine levels were measured to adjust for variations in urine volume by expressing results as the 24-hour urinary cortisol/creatinine ratio.</p><p>Urinary free cortisol and cortisol:creatinine ratio were analyzed using a multiplicative ANCOVA. The multiplicative ANCOVA model involved the natural logarithm of the values on treatment, adjusting for the factors of the natural logarithm of the baseline value, country, and treatment group. LS means and LS mean treatment differences (with their associated 95% confidence intervals), and p-value were reported. The LS means and 95% CI bounds were exponentiated to transform the LS treatment means to LS geometric means and the LS mean treatment difference and confidence intervals for the difference to treatment ratios. All analyses of 24-hr urine free cortisol and cortisol:creatinine ratio were repeated in two separate sensitivity analyses after excluding data for factors that may have affected the urinary cortisol analysis including urine sample collection deviation (Sensitivity Analysis I) and prior corticosteroid use or stopping intranasal steroid use (Sensitivity Analysis II).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUN study</head><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, multi-center study in patients with COPD, consisting of 12 months (52 weeks) of treatment with Symbicort pMDI 2x 160/4.5 µg bid, Symbicort pMDI 2x 80/4.5 µg bid, formoterol TBH 2x 4.5 µg bid, or placebo bid. <ref type="table" target="#tab_89">Table 9</ref> depicts the results of the 24-hour urinary free cortisol as well as urinary cortisol:creatinine ratio at 6 months and end of treatment for all the treatment groups. <ref type="table" target="#tab_89">Table 9</ref> presents the treatment comparisons at 6 months and end of treatment (~12 months) period for corresponding estimates of mean treatment ratios from the multiplicative ANCOVA for 24-hour urinary cortisol.  The results from this study can be summarized as follows:</p><p>1. The baseline geometric mean values in the placebo group were lower compared to the other treatment groups for both urinary cortisol as well as cortisol:creatinine ratio. The geometric LS mean values at 6 months and the end of treatment were Clinical Pharmacology Review NDA 21929 SE01, S012</p><p>19 lower in both Symbicort pMDI groups compared to formoterol 4.5 and placebo <ref type="table" target="#tab_89">(Table 9</ref>). A dose-dependent numerical decrease in cortisol value was observed with budesonide doses of 80 and 160 mcg from Symbicort pMDI <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">(Tables 9 and  10</ref>). 2. Statistically significant differences were seen between the Symbicort pMDI 160/4.5 and placebo groups at 6 months and between Symbicort pMDI 160/4.5 and formoterol 4.5 groups at end of treatment. No other group comparisons were statistically significant <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">(Table 10</ref>). 3. Findings for cortisol/creatinine ratio comparisons between treatment groups were generally consistent with the findings for 24-hour urinary cortisol.</p><p>For 24-hour urinary cortisol, the number of subjects with shifts from normal to low (using criteria used by of &lt;5.5 nmol/24 hr) was generally low across treatment groups. At end of treatment among patients normal at baseline, 1 out of 43 patients in the Symbicort 80/4.5 mcg group, 2 out of 28 patients in the formoterol 4.5 mcg group, and 1 out of 40 patients in the placebo group shifted from normal to low.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SHINE study</head><p>This was a randomized, double-dummy, parallel-group, multi-center study in patients with COPD, consisting of 6 months (26 weeks) of treatment with Symbicort pMDI 160/ 4.5, Symbicort pMDI 80/4.5, budesonide 160, formoterol 4.5, budesonide pMDI 160 mcg and formoterol TBH 4.5 mcg administered together, or placebo. <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">Table 11</ref> depicts the results of the 24-hour urinary free cortisol as well as urinary cortisol:creatinine ratio at 6 months and end of treatment for all the treatment groups. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 12</ref> presents the treatment comparisons at 6 months and end of treatment period for corresponding estimates of mean treatment ratios from the multiplicative ANCOVA for 24-hour urinary cortisol.   The results from this study can be summarized as follows:</p><p>1. The baseline geometric mean values in the Symbicort pMDI 80/4.5 and placebo groups were marginally higher compared to the other treatment groups for both urinary cortisol as well as cortisol:creatinine ratio. 2. Geometric LS mean values for the formoterol 4.5 and placebo groups were the only groups in which the 24-hour urinary cortisol values increased at Month 6 and end of treatment relative to baseline. The geometric LS mean values at 6 months and the end of treatment were lower in all budesonide containing treatment groups compared to formoterol 4.5 and placebo <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">(Table 11)</ref>. A dose-dependent numerical decrease in cortisol value was observed with budesonide doses of 80 and 160 mcg from Symbicort pMDI <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Tables 11 and 12</ref>). 3. Statistically significant differences were seen between all budesonide-containing treatment groups versus placebo or formoterol 4.5 groups, except between Symbicort pMDI 80/4.5 versus placebo.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Does the presence of budesonide affect the PK of formoterol and vice versa?</head><p>Evaluation of drug-drug interaction came from the pharmacokinetic data from SHINE study. In this study, the COPD patients were randomly assigned to the following six treatments: 1) Symbicort 160/4.5 mcg, 2) Symbicort 80/4.5 mcg, 3) Budesonide 160 mcg, 4) Formoterol 4.5 mcg, 5) Budesonide and formoterol administered together, and 6) placebo. Systemic exposure of budesonide and formoterol from treatment 5 compared to treatments 3 and 4, respectively; reflect the impact of drug-drug interaction on the systemic exposure of these drugs. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 15</ref>, budesonide exhibited a small effect on formoterol exposure while there was lack of any measurable effect on budesonide exposure in the presence of formoterol. Formoterol AUC was 12% greater in combination (budesonide 160 mcg and formoterol 4.5 mcg) compared to formoterol 4.5 mcg alone while formoterol C max remained unchanged between the two treatment arms. For Budesonide, both C max and AUC remained nearly identical between the combination and budesonide alone. administration. This is similar to 8-12% formulation effect seen with budesonide <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">(Table  1)</ref>, indicating a lack of drug-drug interaction effect thereby confirming the earlier results.</p><p>For formoterol, about 30% and 13% higher AUC 0-12h and C max , respectively, was observed with Symbicort 160/4.5 compared to formoterol 4.5 alone administration <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">(Table  16</ref>). As indicated in Tables 16 and 20, it appears that the increase in formoterol exposure (AUC) in the presence of budesonide is slightly greater than that can be accounted for by the formulation effect (30% vs. 16%), indicating a small drug-drug interaction effect based on AUC. On the other hand, 13% formoterol C max increase <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">(Table 16</ref>) from Symbicort 160/4.5 is in line with about 12% increase seen due to the formulation effect <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 20)</ref>, suggesting no drug-drug interaction with respect to C max .  <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">Table 18</ref>. Following Symbicort pMDI administration, mean C max , AUC 0-t and AUC 0-∞ were all higher (12-16%) in COPD patients compared to asthma patients. Mean T 1/2 and MRT estimates for formoterol were longer in COPD patients than in asthma patients while T max remained unchanged between the two patient populations. Study D5899C00002 (SHINE) was the pivotal safety and efficacy study which included PK assessments during steady-state administration of Symbicort pMDI and the monoproducts co-administered in COPD patients. The doses tested in this study were the clinical doses of 2 inhalations twice daily for both treatments in a parallel group design.</p><p>Despite the differences in study designs, the results of the two studies were quite similar with respect to the relative bioavailability between Symbicort pMDI and the coadministration of monoproducts. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">Figure 7</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">Table 19</ref>, in the single-dose study, systemic exposure of budesonide was found to be nearly identical between the treatment arms while the steady state comparison <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">(Table 19</ref>) showed slightly higher exposure to budesonide (8-12%) from Symbicort compared to two monoproducts administered together.  On the other hand for formoterol, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 20</ref> showed higher exposure (18-22%) from Symbicort compared to two monoproducts coadministered after single dose administration. This has been further confirmed by the comparative multiple-dose PK data from the SHINE study where about 12-16% higher exposure of formoterol was observed with Symbicort compared to two drugs given together.  These results indicate a lack of any appreciable formulation effect for budesonide while demonstrating a small formulation effect for formoterol when delivered through the pMDI device.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Symbicort:</head><p>The systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids are related to the systemic exposure to such drugs. Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that in both adults and children with asthma, the systemic exposure to budesonide is lower with SYMBICORT compared with inhaled budesonide administered at the same delivered dose via a dry powder inhaler. In COPD patients, the systemic exposure to budesonide is comparable between SYMBICORT and inhaled budesonide administered alone at the same delivered dose via a metered dose inhaler [see Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics, SYMBICORT <ref type="bibr">(12.3)</ref>]. Therefore, the systemic effects (HPA axis and growth) of budesonide delivered from SYMBICORT would be expected to be no greater than what is reported for inhaled budesonide when administered at comparable doses [see Use in Specific Populations, Pediatric Use <ref type="bibr">(8.4)</ref>].</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cardiovascular Effects:</head><p>In 2 clinical studies, 6 months and 12 months in duration including 3668 COPD patients, no clinically important differences were seen in pulse rate, blood pressure, potassium, and glucose between SYMBICORT, the individual components of SYMBICORT, and placebo. (see Clinical Studies <ref type="bibr">[14.2]</ref>).</p><p>ECGs recorded at multiple clinic visits on treatment in both studies showed no clinically important differences for heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, heart rate, signs of cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias between SYMBICORT 160/4.5 the monoproducts and placebo, all administered as two inhalations twice daily. Based on ECGs, 6 patients treated with SYMBICORT 160/4.5, 6 patients treated with formoterol 4.5, and 6 patients in the placebo group experienced atrial fibrillation or flutter that was not present at baseline. There were no cases of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in the SYMBICORT 160/4.5, formoterol 4.5, or placebo groups.</p><p>In the 12-month study, 520 patients had evaluable continuous 24hour ECG (Holter) monitoring prior to the first dose and after approximately 1 and 4 months on treatment. No clinically important differences in ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias, ventricular or supraventricular ectopic beats, or heart rate were observed among the groups treated with SYMBICORT 160/4.5, formoterol or placebo taken as two inhalations twice daily. Based on ECG (Holter) monitoring, one patient on SYMBICORT 160/4.5, no patients on formoterol 4.5, and three patients in the placebo group experienced atrial fibrillation or flutter that was not present at baseline.</p><p>HPA Axis Effects: Twenty-four hour urinary cortisol measurements were collected in a pooled subset (n=616) of patients from two COPD studies. The data indicated approximately 30% lower mean 24-hour urinary free cortisol values following chronic administration (≥6 months) of SYMBICORT relative to placebo. SYMBICORT appeared to exhibit comparable cortisol suppression to budesonide 160 mcg alone or coadministration of budesonide 160 mcg and formoterol 4.5 mcg. For patients treated with SYMBICORT or placebo for up to 12 months, percentage of patients who shifted from normal to low for this measure were generally comparable.</p></div>

The following is the suggested text. Note the yellow highlighted text, which would require input from the sponsor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12.3">Pharmacokinetics</head><p>Absorption: Budesonide: Healthy Subjects: Orally inhaled budesonide is rapidly absorbed in the lungs, and peak concentration is typically reached within 20 minutes. After oral administration of budesonide, peak plasma concentration was achieved in about 1 to 2 hours, and the absolute systemic availability was 6%-13% due to extensive first pass metabolism. In contrast, most of the budesonide delivered to the lungs was systemically absorbed. In healthy subjects, 34% of the metered dose was deposited in the lung (as assessed by plasma concentration method and using a budesonide-containing dry powder inhaler) with an absolute systemic availability of 39% of the metered dose.</p><p>Following administration of SYMBICORT (160/4.5 mcg, two or four inhalations twice daily) for 5 days in healthy subjects, plasma concentration of budesonide generally increased in proportion to dose. The accumulation index for the group that received two inhalations twice daily was 1.32 for budesonide.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Asthma Patients:</head><p>In a single-dose study, higher than recommended doses of SYMBICORT (12 inhalations of SYMBICORT 160/4.5 mcg) were administered to patients with moderate asthma. Peak budesonide plasma concentration of 4.5 nmol/L occurred at 20 minutes following dosing. This study demonstrated that the total systemic exposure to budesonide from SYMBICORT was approximately 30% lower than from inhaled budesonide via a dry powder inhaler (DPI) at the same delivered dose. Following administration of SYMBICORT, the half-life of the budesonide component was 4.7 hours.</p><p>In a repeat dose study, the highest recommended dose of SYMBICORT (160/4.5 mcg, two inhalations twice daily) was administered to patients with moderate asthma and healthy subjects for 1 week. Peak budesonide plasma concentration of 1.2 nmol/L occurred at 21 minutes in asthma patients. Peak budesonide plasma concentration was about XX% (Comment: Request sponsor to provide the data as well as data source) higher in healthy subjects, compared to that in asthma patients. However, the total systemic exposure of budesonide was comparable to that in asthma patients.</p><p>Peak steady-state plasma concentrations of budesonide administered by DPI in adults with asthma averaged 0.6 and 1.6 nmol/L at doses of 180 mcg and 360 mcg twice daily, respectively. In asthmatic patients, budesonide showed a linear increase in AUC and C max with increasing dose after both single and repeated dosing of inhaled budesonide.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COPD Patients:</head><p>In a single-dose study, 12 inhalations of SYMBICORT 80/4.5 mcg (total dose 960/54 mcg) were administered to patients with COPD. Mean budesonide peak plasma concentration of 3.3 nmol/L occurred at 30 minutes following dosing. Budesonide systemic exposure was comparable between SYMBICORT pMDI and coadministration of budesonide via a metered-dose inhaler and formoterol via a dry powder inhaler (budesonide 960 mcg and formoterol 54 mcg). In the same study, an open-label group of moderate asthma patients also received the same higher dose of SYMBICORT. For budesonide, COPD patients exhibited 12% greater AUC and 10% lower C max compared to asthma patients.</p><p>In the 6 month pivotal clinical study, steady-state pharmacokinetic data of budesonide was obtained in a subset of COPD patients with treatment arms of SYMBICORT pMDI 160/4.5 mcg, SYMBICORT pMDI 80/4.5 mcg, budesonide 160 mcg, budesonide 160 mcg and formoterol 4.5 mcg given together, all administered as two inhalations twice daily. Budesonide systemic exposure (AUC and C max ) increased proportionally with doses from 80 mcg to 160 mcg and was generally similar between the 3 treatment groups receiving the same dose of budesonide (SYMBICORT pMDI 160/4.5 mcg, budesonide 160 mcg, budesonide 160 mcg and formoterol 4.5 mcg administered together)..</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formoterol:</head><p>Inhaled formoterol is rapidly absorbed; peak plasma concentrations are typically reached at the first plasma sampling time, within 5-10 minutes after dosing. As with many drug products for oral inhalation, it is likely that the majority of the inhaled formoterol delivered is swallowed and then absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>Healthy Subjects: Following administration of SYMBICORT (160/4.5 mcg, two or four inhalations twice daily) for 5 days in healthy subjects, plasma concentration of formoterol generally increased in proportion to dose. The accumulation index for the group that received two inhalations twice daily was 1.77 for formoterol.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Asthma patients:</head><p>In a single-dose study, higher than recommended doses of SYMBICORT (12 inhalations of SYMBICORT 160/4.5 mcg) were administered to patients with moderate asthma. Peak plasma concentration for formoterol of 136 pmol occurred at 10 minutes following dosing. Approximately 8% of the delivered dose of formoterol was recovered in the urine as unchanged drug.</p><p>In a repeat dose study, the highest recommended dose of SYMBICORT (160/4.5 mcg, two inhalations twice daily) was administered to patients with moderate asthma and healthy subjects for 1 week. Peak formoterol plasma concentration of 28 pmol/L occurred at 10 minutes in asthma patients. Peak formoterol plasma concentration was about XX% (Comment:</p><p>Request sponsor to provide the data as well as data source) higher in healthy subjects, compared to that in asthma patients. However, the total systemic exposure of formoterol was comparable to that in asthma patients.</p><p>COPD patients: Following single-dose administration of 12 inhalations of SYMBICORT 80/4.5, mean peak formoterol plasma concentration of 167 pmol/L was rapidly achieved at 15 minutes after dosing. Formoterol exposure was slightly greater (~16-18%) from SYMBICORT pMDI compared to coadministration of budesonide via a metered-dose inhaler and formoterol via a dry powder inhaler (total dose of budesonide 960 mcg and formoterol 54 mcg). In the same study, an openlabel group of moderate asthma patients also received the same higher dose of SYMBICORT. COPD patients exhibited 12-16% greater AUC and C max for formoterol compared to asthma patients.</p><p>In the 6 month pivotal clinical study, steady-state pharmacokinetic data of formoterol was obtained in a subset of COPD patients with treatment arms of SYMBICORT pMDI 160/4.5 mcg, SYMBICORT pMDI 80/4.5 mcg, formoterol 4.5 mcg, budesonide 160 mcg and formoterol 4.5 mcg given together, all administered as two inhalations twice daily. The systemic exposure of formoterol as evidenced by AUC, was about 30% and 16% higher from Symbicort pMDI compared to formoterol alone treatment arm and coadministration of individual components of budesonide and formoterol treatment arm, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distribution: Budesonide:</head><p>The volume of distribution of budesonide was approximately 3 L/kg. It was 85%-90% bound to plasma proteins. Protein binding was constant over the concentration range (1-100 nmol/L) achieved with, and exceeding, recommended inhaled doses. Budesonide showed little or no binding to corticosteroid binding globulin. Budesonide rapidly equilibrated with red blood cells in a concentration independent manner with a blood/plasma ratio of about 0.8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formoterol:</head><p>Over the concentration range of 10-500 nmol/L, plasma protein binding for the RR and SS enantiomers of formoterol was 46% and 58%, respectively. The concentrations of formoterol used to assess the plasma protein binding were higher than those achieved in plasma following inhalation of a single 54-mcg dose.</p><p>Metabolism: Budesonide: In vitro studies with human liver homogenates have shown that budesonide was rapidly and extensively metabolized. Two major metabolites formed via cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) catalyzed biotransformation have been isolated and identified as 16αhydroxyprednisolone and 6β-hydroxybudesonide. The corticosteroid activity of each of these two metabolites was less than 1% of that of the parent compound. No qualitative differences between the in vitro and in vivo metabolic patterns were detected. Negligible metabolic inactivation was observed in human lung and serum preparations.</p><p>Formoterol: The primary metabolism of formoterol is by direct glucuronidation and by O-demethylation followed by conjugation to inactive metabolites. Secondary metabolic pathways include deformylation and sulfate conjugation. CYP2D6 and CYP2C have been identified as being primarily responsible for O-demethylation.</p><p>Elimination: Budesonide: Budesonide was excreted in urine and feces in the form of metabolites. Approximately 60% of an intravenous radiolabeled dose was recovered in the urine. No unchanged budesonide was detected in the urine. The 22R form of budesonide was preferentially cleared by the liver with systemic clearance of 1.4 L/min vs 1.0 L/min for the 22S form. The terminal half-life, 2 to 3 hours, was the same for both epimers and was independent of dose.</p><p>Formoterol: The excretion of formoterol was studied in four healthy subjects following simultaneous administration of radiolabeled formoterol via the oral and IV routes. In that study, 62% of the radiolabeled formoterol was excreted in the urine while 24% was eliminated in the feces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Populations Geriatric</head><p>The pharmacokinetics of SYMBICORT in geriatric patients have not been specifically studied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pediatric</head><p>Plasma concentrations of budesonide were measured following administration of four inhalations of SYMBICORT 160/4.5 mcg in a single-dose study in pediatric patients with asthma, 6-11 years of age. Urine was collected for determination of formoterol excretion. Peak budesonide concentrations of 1.4 nmol/L occurred at 20 minutes post-dose. Approximately 3.5% of the delivered formoterol dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged formoterol. This study also demonstrated that the total systemic exposure to budesonide from SYMBICORT was approximately 30% lower than from inhaled budesonide via a dry powder inhaler that was also evaluated at the same delivered dose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gender/Race</head><p>Specific studies to examine the effects of gender and race on the pharmacokinetics of SYMBICORT have not been conducted. Population PK analysis of the SYMBICORT data indicates that gender does not affect the pharmacokinetics of budesonide and formoterol. No conclusions can be drawn on the effect of race due to the low number of non-Caucasians evaluated for PK.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Renal or Hepatic Insufficiency</head><p>There are no data regarding the specific use of SYMBICORT in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Reduced liver function may affect the elimination of corticosteroids. Budesonide pharmacokinetics was affected by compromised liver function as evidenced by a doubled systemic availability after oral ingestion.</p><p>The intravenous budesonide pharmacokinetics was, however, similar in cirrhotic patients and in healthy subjects. Specific data with formoterol is not available, but because formoterol is primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism, an increased exposure can be expected in patients with severe liver impairment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Drug-Drug Interactions</head><p>A single-dose crossover study was conducted to compare the pharmacokinetics of eight inhalations of the following: budesonide, formoterol, and budesonide plus formoterol administered concurrently. The results of the study indicated that there was no evidence of a pharmacokinetic interaction between the two components of SYMBICORT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450s</head><p>Ketoconazole: Ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4), the main metabolic enzyme for corticosteroids, increased plasma levels of orally ingested budesonide.</p><p>Cimetidine: At recommended doses, cimetidine, a non-specific inhibitor of CYP enzymes, had a slight but clinically insignificant effect on the pharmacokinetics of oral budesonide.</p><p>Specific drug-drug interaction studies with formoterol have not been performed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">BACKGROUND</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>This review was written in response to a request from the Division of Pulmonary and Allergy Products to evaluate the package insert labeling and medication guide labeling for Symbicort, for the potential to contribute to medication errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">REGULATORY HISTORY</head><p>Symbicort (Budesonide and Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate) Inhalation Aerosol was approved on July 21, 2006, for the long-term maintenance treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older. An efficacy supplement (SE1-012) was submitted on April 28, 2008, and provides support for a new indication for the maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">PRODUCT INFORMATION</head><p>Symbicort (Budesonide and Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate) Inhalation Aerosol is a combination product containing a corticosteroid and a long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonist. Symbicort is currently indicated for the long-term maintenance treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older. The recommended dose for asthma is 2 inhalations of Symbicort 80/4.5 twice daily or 2 inhalations of Symbicort 160/4.5 twice daily. The proposed usual dose for the COPD indication is 2 inhalations of Symbicort 160/4.5 twice daily. Symbicort is available in two strengths: 80/4.5 (containing 80 mcg of budesonide and 4.5 mcg of formoterol fumarate dihydrate) and 160/4.5 (containing 160 mcg of budesonide and 4.5 mcg of formoterol fumarate dihydrate). Symbicort 80/4.5 and Symbicort 160/4.5 are available in 120 inhalation canister and 60 inhalation canister package sizes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS AND MATERIALS</head><p>This section describes the methods and materials used by DMEPA staff to conduct a label, labeling, and/or packaging risk assessment. The primary focus of the assessment is to identify and remedy potential sources of medication error prior to drug approval. The Division of Medication Error Prevention and Analysis defines a medication error as any preventable event that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm while the medication is in the control of the health care professional, patient, or consumer. 1</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">LABEL AND LABELING RISK ASSESSMENT</head><p>The label and labeling of a drug product are the primary means by which practitioners and patients (depending on configuration) interact with the pharmaceutical product. The container labels and carton labeling communicate critical information including proprietary and established name, strength, form, container quantity, expiration, and so on. The insert labeling is intended to communicate to practitioners all information relevant to the approved uses of the drug, including the correct dosing and administration.</p><p>Given the critical role that the label and labeling has in the safe use of drug products, it is not surprising that 33 percent of medication errors reported to the USP-ISMP Medication Error Reporting Program may be attributed to the packaging and labeling of drug products, including 30 percent of fatal errors. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Because DMEPA staff analyze reported misuse of drugs, our staff are able to use this experience to identify potential errors with all medication similarly packaged, labeled or prescribed. We use FMEA and the principles of human factors to identify potential sources of error with the proposed product labels and insert labeling, and provided recommendations that aim at reducing the risk of medication errors.</p><p>For this product the Applicant submitted on April 28, 2008, the following labeling for our review:</p><p>• Package Insert (no image)</p><p>• Medication Guide (no image)</p><p>In addition to the labeling submitted by the Applicant, the following materials were also reviewed:</p><p>• FDA-proposed labeling dated December 10, 2008. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING SYSTEM (AERS)</head><p>On The cases were manually reviewed to determine if medication errors occurred. Those cases that did not describe a medication error were excluded from further analysis. The cases that did describe a medication error were categorized by type of error. We reviewed the cases within each category to identify factors that contributed to the medication errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">LABELING RISK ASSESSMENT</head><p>Review of the package insert labeling identified certain areas of inconsistency that may lead to confusion and medication error.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Insert Labeling</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Highlights Section</head><p>In the FDA-proposed labeling dated December 10, 2008, the following inconsistencies were noted:</p><p>• In the Highlights Section, an asterisk is present following the established name, formoterol fumarate dihydrate and lacks a corresponding statement. • The established name is presented as 'formoterol' throughout the insert labeling which is not consistent with the established name, formoterol fumarate dihydrate.</p><p>• In the Full Prescribing Information, the statement "(morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart)" is not used in Section 2.2 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD); therefore, it is not consistent with Section 2.1 Asthma.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Medication Guide Labeling</head><p>A review of the Medication Guide was completed by the Division of Risk Management (DRISK), Patient Labeling and Education Team on December 30, 2008. DMEPA does not have any comments on the Medication Guide in addition to those recommended by DRISK.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING SYSTEM (AERS)</head><p>The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) search conducted on December 4, 2008, yielded a total of fourteen cases (n=14). Two cases (n=2) involved adverse events in which Symbicort was identified either as a suspect or concomitant medication, and thus were eliminated from further review. Five cases (n=5) were foreign cases reporting either an increased or decreased effect occurring with the use of Symbicort Turbuhaler. The Turbuhaler device is not the same device approved for Symbicort in the United States, thus these reports were eliminated from further review. Four cases (n=4) involved medication errors due to defective devices.</p><p>Three cases (n=3) were further evaluated in order to identify factors that contributed to medication error related to the use of Symbicort pMDI. These cases of medication error resulted in either an increased effect or decreased effect due to incorrect use of Symbicort pMDI.</p><p>o One case (n=1) reported that the patient was using Symbicort (strength unknown) 4 inhalations twice daily via tracheal. Patient was hospitalized at the time of the occurrence and an adverse event was experienced (chest pain). Physician was aware that the prescribed dose exceeded the recommended dose.</p><p>o One case (n=1) reported a decreased effect secondary to use of Symbicort pMDI. Patient followed up with her physician and was informed that she was using the Symbicort pMDI incorrectly. No additional information was provided, therefore, causality could not be determined. No follow up or outcome was reported.</p><p>o One case (n=1) reported an increased effect resulting from administration of Symbicort pMDI every 4 hours. The patient experienced an increase in heart rate. No rationale was provided for the increased frequency of administration, thus causality could not be established. The current labeling clearly indicates that Symbicort pMDI should be administered twice daily, thus it is unlikely that incorrect usage in this case is a result of inadequate package insert labeling.</p><p>DMEPA does not believe that any of these medication errors cases are likely to have resulted from inadequate insert labeling or medication guide labeling. Thus, these cases will not be further discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION</head><p>In our analysis of the package insert labeling, we identified problems with inconsistencies and incomplete information. In the beginning of the Highlights Section of the FDA-proposed labeling dated December 10, 2008, an asterisk is presented following the established name, formoterol fumarate dihydrate, however, the corresponding qualifying statement has been deleted. The asterisk is no longer necessary since the amount of formoterol fumarate dihydrate is correctly denoted as 4.5 mcg following the established name.</p><p>Additionally, in the Full Prescribing Information, the statement "(morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart)" was not used in Section 2.2 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). This is not consistent with Section 2.1 Asthma and may also have been an oversight.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>DMEPA did not identify any vulnerabilities in the insert labeling that could lead to medication errors as a result of the expansion of the indication of use to include maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. However, the Labeling Risk Assessment indicates that there are minor inconsistencies in the presentation of information in the package insert labeling. DMEPA believes these inconsistencies can be addressed and mitigated prior to drug approval, and provides recommendations in Section 6 that aim at reducing the risk of medication errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>AstraZeneca received original approval of their New Drug Application, NDA 21-929 on July 21, 2006. Symbicort is currently indicated for the long-term maintenance treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older. The most recently approved labeling for Symbicort is dated July 16, 2008 (Supplement 010). On April 28, 2008, AstraZeneca submitted a Supplemental New Drug Application, sNDA 21-929/S-012, proposing a new indication for Symbicort for the maintenance of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The submission includes draft revised Professional Information in PLR format and also a draft revised Medication Guide for Symbicort. The sponsor submitted revised labeling for Supplement 012 on July 24, 2008 and August 25, 2008 in response to Agency comments and requests.</p><p>Since Advair Diskus was required to have a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) related to their indication for COPD and the risk of pneumonia, the review division has determined that it is also appropriate for Symbicort to have a REMS associated with the COPD indication and risk of pneumonia. The sponsor has not yet submitted their REMS.</p><p>This DRISK review focuses on the proposed changes to the Medication Guide due to the addition of the new indication and new safety information about pneumonia to the PI, and conversion of the PI to PLR format. The sponsor's proposed REMS will be reviewed by DRISK under separate cover once it is submitted to the Agency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">MATERIAL REVIEWED</head><p>• SYMBICORT Medication Guide (MG) submitted by the sponsor on August 25, 2008.</p><p>• SYMBICORT Professional Information as revised by DPAP on December 10, 2008.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">DISCUSSION</head><p>The purpose of patient directed labeling is to facilitate and enhance appropriate use and provide important risk information about medications. Our recommended changes are consistent with current research to improve risk communication to a broad audience, including those with lower literacy.</p><p>The draft MG submitted by the sponsor has a Flesch Kinkaid grade level of 7.7, and a Flesch Reading Ease score of 66.3%. To enhance patient comprehension, materials should be written at a 6 th to 8 th grade reading level, and have a reading ease score of at least 60% (60% corresponds to an 8 th grade reading level). The reading scores as submitted by the sponsor are acceptable.</p><p>In our review of the MG, we have:</p><p>• simplified wording and clarified concepts where possible,</p><p>• ensured that the MG is consistent with the PI, • rearranged information due to conversion of the PI to PLR format,</p><p>• removed unnecessary or redundant information • ensured that the Medication Guide meets the Regulations as specified in 21 CFR 208.20.  </p></div>

We also refer to your submissions dated August 7, and 20, 2008.</p><p>We are reviewing the Clinical section of your submission and have the following comments and information requests. We request a prompt written response in order to continue our evaluation of your supplemental NDA.</p><p>The following information request pertains to the "Adverse Events of Interest: Lung Infections" section of the SUN Clinical Study Report (p. 207). It is stated that "there were 78 subjects with at least 1 event and slightly fewer events on all active treatments compared to placebo…..A total of 49 subjects had pneumonia SAEs during randomized treatment and 12 of these SAEs led to a DAE." In the paragraph following <ref type="table" target="#tab_85">Table 67</ref> on p. 207, it is stated that "there were 8 SAEs in the bronchitis category…" Clarify these numbers as they do not seem to be consistent in subsequent sections where SAEs and DAEs are described. For example, in <ref type="table" target="#tab_86">Table 78</ref> of the SUN CSR (p. 236), there are only 30 pneumonia SAEs reported (as opposed to the 49 stated above) and only 5 bronchitis SAEs (as opposed to 8 stated above). Further, in <ref type="table" target="#tab_86">Table 79</ref> (p. 238), only 8 pneumonia DAEs are listed (as opposed to the 12 listed above). Provide an explanation as to the discrepancy in the numbers and fill in the tables provided below, so that all the data may be readily compared. Provide the same information for the SHINE study as well. If this presentation of data is already present in the NDA submission, provide its location.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>• NDA 21 -</head><label>21</label><figDesc>929 REMS ASSESSMENT • NEW SUPPLEMENT FOR NDA 21-929 PROPOSED REMS MODIFICATION &lt; other supplement identification &gt; [if included] &lt;REMS ASSESSMENT&gt; [if included]If you do not submit electronically, please send 5 copies of submissions containing REMS assessments or proposed modifications of the REMS.HIGHLIGHTS OF PRESCRIBING INFORMATION These highlights do not include all the information needed to use SYMBICORT safely and effectively.

An End-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting was held with the Division in April 2004 to discuss the COPD development program. The two pivotal Phase 3 protocols were submitted to IND 63,394 (Serial No. 0336) in March 2005. Review of the protocol revealed that the Applicant had incorporated the Division's suggestions from the EOP2 meeting. No major recommendations were issued at that time. The Division also responded to questions in a pre-NDA briefing document in December 2007. Based on the Division's responses, the Applicant did not feel that a pre-sNDA meeting was necessary.</figDesc></figure>

For change in mean values across treatments, there were increases in ventricular ectopy (VE, beats/hour) and heart rate for the For VE rate, the percentage of subjects with shifts from normal at baseline to high on-treatment values was highest in the Symbicort HD group (18.6%) and lowest in the placebo group (12.2%).

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_36"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>.12 Special Safety Studies HPA-axis function in COPD patients was assessed by measuring 24-hour urinary free cortisol (24h-UFC) in a subgroup of subjects in both SUN (179 subjects) and SHINE (437 subjects) studies. In both studies, 24-hour urine specimens were collected at baseline (prior to randomization), at Month 6 (SUN and SHINE), and at Month 12 (SUN). Urine samples were analyzed for urinary free cortisol and creatinine. Creatinine levels were measured to adjust for variations in urine volume by expressing results as the 24-hour urinary cortisol/creatinine ratio.Urinary free cortisol and cortisol:creatinine ratio were analyzed using a multiplicative ANCOVA. The multiplicative ANCOVA model involved the natural logarithm of the values on treatment, adjusting for the factors of the natural logarithm of the baseline value, country, and treatment group.The following high-level conclusions can be drawn from the combined 24h-UFC data collected from the two Phase 3 studies (SUN and SHINE):1. Both higher and lower strengths of Symbicort exhibited measurable suppression of 24h-UFC levels following chronic twice daily inhalation administration in COPD patients relative to placebo. While the cortisol suppression of 30% from Symbicort 160/4.5 mcg was statistically significant (p=0.001), 17% suppression from Symbicort 80/4.5 mcg did not achieve statistical significance (p=0.102). This suggests a dose-dependent response in the budesonide dose range of 160 to 320 mcg following twice daily administration.2. Symbicort 160/4.5 exhibited comparable cortisol suppression to budesonide 160 mcg alone treatment or free combination of budesonide 160 mcg and formoterol 4.5 mcg.

Severity classification, based on the GOLD 2006 criteria applied to postbronchodilator FEV1 at Visit 1, indicated that approximately 80% of the study population had severe or very severe COPD, while 20% had moderate COPD at entry. In general, demographic and key baseline characteristics were similar across treatment groups and geographic regions (US vs. non-US). Exceptions included a higher percentage of women in the US (41.5% of the total) than in the non-US region (24.8%).

The sample size required for exacerbations assured adequate power for the primary variable, FEV1. With a sample size of 400 per treatment group, the power to detect a 0.10 L difference in FEV1 is greater than 95%, based on an estimated standard deviation of 0.3L. The primary and secondary efficacy analyses were identical to the SHINE study (see Appendix 10.1, Statistical Plan, p. 77). Additional safety variables to be assessed in this study include 24- hour Holter monitoring, bone mineral density, and ophthalmologic examination.</note></figure>

In both studies, 24-hour urine specimens were collected at baseline (prior to randomization), at Month 6 (SUN and SHINE), and at Month 12 (SUN). Urine samples were analyzed for urinary free cortisol and creatinine. Creatinine levels were measured to adjust for variations in urine volume by expressing results as the 24-hour urinary cortisol/creatinine ratio.Urinary free cortisol and cortisol:creatinine ratio were analyzed using a multiplicative ANCOVA. The multiplicative ANCOVA model involved the natural logarithm of the values on treatment, adjusting for the factors of the natural logarithm of the baseline value, country, and treatment group. Visual inspection of the cortisol suppression data from Symbicort pMDI plotted against budesonide steady-state systemic exposure data (C max and AUC 0-12h ) revealed completely random distribution and therefore failed to reveal any apparent trend towards an exposure-response relationship. Therefore, exploration of PK/PD relationship was not pursued further. pMDI also contains the non-ozone-depleting hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellant, HFA-227, the suspending agent polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) K25, and the lubricant polyethylene glycol (PEG) 1000. Symbicort pMDI received approval from the FDA on 21 July 2006 for the long-term maintenance treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older. Two formulation strengths of Symbicort pMDI were evaluated in the COPD clinical development program: 80/4.5 mcg per actuation and 160/4.5 mcg per actuation, each administered as 2 actuations per dose. These strengths correspond to doses of 160/9 mcg, and 320/9 mcg, respectively, each administered on a twice daily regimen.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Following high-level conclusions can be drawn from the combined 24h-UFC data</cell></row><row><cell>collected from the two Phase 3 studies (SUN and SHINE):</cell></row><row><cell>1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Is this application for a recombinant or biologically-derived product? YES NO</head><p>If "Yes "contact your ODE's Office of Regulatory Policy representative. <ref type="bibr">5</ref>. The purpose of the questions below (questions 5 to 6) is to determine if there is an approved drug product that is equivalent or very similar to the product proposed for approval that should be referenced as a listed drug in the pending application.</p><p>(a) Is there a pharmaceutical equivalent(s) to the product proposed in the 505(b)(2) application that is already approved? YES NO (Pharmaceutical equivalents are drug products in identical dosage forms that: (1) contain identical amounts of the identical active drug ingredient, i.e., the same salt or ester of the same therapeutic moiety, or, in the case of modified release dosage forms that require a reservoir or overage or such forms as prefilled syringes where residual volume may vary, that deliver identical amounts of the active drug ingredient over the identical dosing period; (2) do not necessarily contain the same inactive ingredients; and (3) meet the identical compendial or other applicable standard of identity, strength, quality, and purity, including potency and, where applicable, content uniformity, disintegration times, and/or dissolution rates. (21 CFR 320.1(c))</p><p>If "No," to (a) skip to question 6. Otherwise, answer part (b and (c)). (Pharmaceutical alternatives are drug products that contain the identical therapeutic moiety, or its precursor, but not necessarily in the same amount or dosage form or as the same salt or ester. Each such drug product individually meets either the identical or its own respective compendial or other applicable standard of identity, strength, quality, and purity, including potency and, where applicable, content uniformity, disintegration times and/or dissolution rates. (21 CFR 320.1(d)) Different dosage forms and strengths within a product line by a single manufacturer are thus pharmaceutical alternatives, as are extended-release products when compared with immediate-or standard-release formulations of the same active ingredient.) (b) Does any of the published literature cited reference a specific (e.g. brand name) product? Note that if yes, the applicant will be required to submit patent certification for the product, see question 12.</p><p>8. Describe the change from the listed drug(s) provided for in this (b)(2) application (for example, "This application provides for a new indication, otitis media" or "This application provides for a change in dosage form, from capsules to solution").</p><p>9. Is the application for a duplicate of a listed drug and eligible for approval under YES NO section 505(j) as an ANDA? (Normally, FDA may refuse-to-file such NDAs (see 21 CFR 314.101(d)(9)). <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">10</ref>. Is the application for a duplicate of a listed drug whose only difference is YES NO that the extent to which the active ingredient(s) is absorbed or otherwise made available to the site of action less than that of the reference listed drug (RLD)?

Section 505-1(a)(1) provides the following factors:</p><p>(A) The estimated size of the population likely to use the drug involved; (B) The seriousness of the disease or condition that is to be treated with the drug; (C) The expected benefit of the drug with respect to such disease or condition; (D) The expected or actual duration of treatment with the drug; (E) The seriousness of any known or potential adverse events that may be related to the drug and the background incidence of such events in the population likely to use the drug; (F) Whether the drug is a new molecular entity (NME).</p><p>Since SYMBICORT was approved July 2006, FDA has become aware of an increased incidence of lower respiratory tract infections in patients with COPD who take SYMBICORT. This information is from controlled clinical trials (one 6-month and one 12-month safety and efficacy trial) submitted with this supplemental new drug application. This information was not available when SYMBICORT was granted marketing authorization. Therefore, we consider this information to be "new safety information" as defined in FDAAA.</p><p>After consultations between the Office of New Drugs and the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology, we have determined that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of SYMBICORT outweigh its risks. In reaching this determination we considered the following:</p><p>A. SYMBICORT is indicated for maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) COPD patients. The estimated 2 number of patients in the United States with this condition is approximately 15.3 million. This estimate is based on smoking rates and the spirometric definition for COPD used in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We anticipate that COPD patients are likely to be prescribed SYMBICORT.</p><p>B. COPD is a chronic progressive lung disease that includes chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or both. The disease is characterized by progressive airflow obstruction. Patients with COPD have progressive shortness of breath, and have frequent exacerbations characterized by increased sputum production and cough, and decline in lung function. COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> C. In clinical studies with SYMBICORT, there was improvement in airflow obstruction and reduction in exacerbations with COPD. Improvement of airflow obstruction was demonstrated in clinical studies lasting 6 months to 12 months in duration.</p><p>D. Since COPD is a chronic disease, the expected duration of treatment with SYMBICORT is one year or longer. It is possible that some healthcare providers may maintain some patients with COPD on SYMBICORT for their lifetime.</p><p>E. Lower respiratory tract infections are the most serious adverse events associated with the use of SYMBICORT in COPD patients. Respiratory tract infections, particularly in COPD patients, can be serious and can cause substantial morbidity. The precise background incidence of lower respiratory tract infections in COPD patients is not known. Data from a 6 month and 12 month study with SYMBICORT in COPD patients with about 800 patients in the placebo groups showed that 5.1% of patients had lung infections other than pneumonia, which is one estimate of the background rate in COPD patients. In these studies, 7.9% of patients treated with SYMBICORT had lung infections other than pneumonia.</p><p>F. SYMBICORT is not a new molecular entity.</p><p>In accordance with section 505-1 of the FDCA, as one element of a REMS, FDA may require the development of a Medication Guide as provided for under 21 CFR Part 208. Pursuant to 21 CFR Part 208, FDA has determined that SYMBICORT poses a serious and significant public health concern requiring the distribution of a Medication Guide. The Medication Guide is necessary for patients' safe and effective use of SYMBICORT. FDA has determined that SYMBICORT is a product that has serious risk(s) (relative to benefits) of which patients should be made aware because information concerning the risk(s) could affect patients' decisions to use, or continue to use SYMBICORT. In addition, patient labeling could help prevent serious adverse events related to the use of the product.  If your answer is "no" because you believe the study is a bioavailability study and, therefore, not eligible for exclusivity, EXPLAIN why it is a bioavailability study, including your reasons for disagreeing with any arguments made by the applicant that the study was not simply a bioavailability study.</p></div>
