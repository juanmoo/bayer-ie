<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Page 3 edify practitioners. Consequently, we do not agree that information about the medication errors should be included in labeling.</p><p>Second, we do not agree that the labeling should include information regarding how many additional events in the apixaban arm or fewer events in the warfarin arm it would take to make the death finding not be statistically significant. A p-value of 0.0465 already implies that the results are close. One way to think about a statistically significant mortality finding is that there were so many fewer deaths in the apixaban arm than in the control arm (in the ITT analysis, 603 vs. 669, 66 fewer, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>) that it is very unlikely that the observed finding was due to chance. If this difference in deaths is reduced to 65, there are still many fewer deaths in the apixaban arm. In order to establish superiority, it is not appropriate to require both the "cushion" of fewer deaths needed to achieve statistical significance at the 0.05 level plus an additional cushion to take care of post hoc "what ifs." Moreover, the analysis that determines the number of events needed to overturn the mortality study finding (or stroke/se or major bleeding) is exploratory, highly conservative, non-random, and somewhat unrealistic. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> It should not be used for labeling. Reviewer's analysis: erateHR create run eff tx txn7 txn30.sas, applicant's data: adefl, adbs2 Stroke SE is the primary endpoint. âˆ†=events in warfarin arm -events in apixaban arm The period of analysis for the event was defined as: ITT = randomization to January 30, 2011 (efficacy cut-off date) Tx = first dose to last dose + 2 days (per protocol definition) TxLD+7 = first dose to last dose + 7 days TxLD+30 = first dose to last dose +30 days <ref type="bibr">Page 4</ref> In addition, the missing data rate in ARISTOTLE cited by Dr. Marciniak (3.2% to 3.6% for vital status) is not especially large and more importantly, it is unclear whether the missingness was biased in favor of apixaban. The primary efficacy analysis in this study was the ITT analysis. In a large global study with many subjects who withdraw consent, it is possible to lose track of subjects that stop coming to a site before the cutoff date for the ITT analysis. Perhaps some were lost to follow-up because they had a stroke or died, which potentially biases the study results. However, there is no reason to believe that this was more likely in the apixaban arm than in the warfarin arm. We cannot directly address whether the missing data are biased in one direction. However, on-treatment analyses are less likely to have missing follow-up information during the period of analysis. In the on-treatment analyses shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, events are counted if they occurred during the analysis period. If the ITT analyses were biased in favor of apixaban because of differential event rates in those whose data are missing, one would expect the on-treatment results for the primary endpoint and death to be less favorable for apixaban than the ITT results because of better follow-up while subjects are on treatment. If the assumed bias in ITT analysis were removed in this way, we would expect the hazard ratio for death or the primary endpoint to move in favor of warfarin compared to ITT, barring other effects. Instead, point estimates for the ontreatment analyses for the primary endpoint and death are both slightly lower -i.e., more favorable for apixaban -than the corresponding ITT results ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1)</ref>. While this is not definitive proof of a lack of bias in the ITT analysis, it is reassuring and suggests that bias, if present, was not large. Given this reassurance from the on-treatment analyses and the lack of information to suggest bias in the ITT analysis, it would be confusing and potentially misleading to include data on follow-up statistics from ARISTOTLE in labeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Observed Persistence of the Effect of Apixaban on Death after end of Study Treatment</head><p>One other issue regarding the mortality finding should be mentioned. In the ITT analysis, there were 66 fewer all-cause deaths, but this was reduced to a difference of 31 deaths in the on-treatment analysis. However, for primary endpoint events, the analogous differences in event counts are 53 and 49, respectively. Thus, for primary endpoint events (which were mostly strokes), nearly all of the benefit of apixaban was established during the treatment period, as one might expect for an anticoagulant. However, for death, a substantial portion of the benefit of apixaban was established off treatment ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1)</ref>. This might be interpreted to make the observed benefit of apixaban for all-cause mortality to be less credible.</p><p>However, there is an explanation for the observed persistence of the effect of apixaban on mortality after study drug is discontinued that does not undercut the strength of the overall finding in the ITT analysis. It relates to the large effect of apixaban on the rate of fatal stroke, the timing of death in fatal stroke cases, and the fact that physicians practice medicine conservatively, i.e., when a patient in a clinical study becomes <ref type="bibr">Page 5</ref> seriously ill, they are often taken off an investigational drug and treated with usual therapy for the patient's condition.</p><p>In ARISTOTLE, the difference between the treatment arms in fatal stroke strongly favored apixaban in the ITT analysis (38 vs. 65 deaths, HR=0.58, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.86). It is notable that while fatal stroke accounts for less than 10% of deaths in the ARISTOTLE ITT analysis, the difference in the number of fatal strokes between the treatment arms accounts for more than 40% of the overall difference in deaths. This relationship was also observed in RE-LY (see our review of Applicant's Complete Response dated 10 Dec. 2012). This difference suggests that the observed overall difference in favor of apixaban is not due to chance. It thus seems useful to examine the timing of stroke mortality in relation to the subjects last dose of study drug and last known stroke event. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 1</ref> is a display of the difference in days between the last dose of study drug and the last known adjudicated stroke in subjects with death adjudicated as a CV death due to stroke ("fatal stroke") in 102 of the 109 subjects with a fatal stroke in the ITT analysis. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Data for both treatment arms are combined in this figure and the 2 others that follow, but all of the trends in the data in the 3 figures discussed here were similar in the two treatment arms (data not shown).The majority of subjects with a fatal stroke (72 subjects, or 71%) had their last dose of study drug on the day of the stroke or one day earlier. This is consistent with the conservative practice of discontinuing an experimental drug when a patient becomes seriously ill, especially when other recommended therapies are available. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> is a display of the difference in days between the last dose of study drug and death for the same 102 subjects, and <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows data for the days between the final stroke and death. For fatal stroke, which was the single largest contributor to the difference in deaths between the treatment arms, the data indicate only 30 of the subjects (29%) died "on treatment" (i.e., 0 to 2 days after their last dose of study drug, and 56 (55%) died within 7 days of their final last dose <ref type="figure">(Figure 2)</ref>. Forty-eight subjects (47%) died within 2 days of their final stroke, 77 (75%) died within 7 days of their final stroke <ref type="figure">(Figure 3)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, the data from the sample of subjects with fatal strokes indicate that a substantial part of the apparent late effect of apixaban on death has an explanation that does not undercut the observed beneficial effect of apixaban on mortality: In 29% of subjects with a known date for their final and fatal stroke, the stroke occurred after the ontreatment period. However, over half of deaths occurred more than 2 days after the final stroke and 1/4 of subjects in the sample died more than 7 days after their last stroke. Thus, it is not surprising that the effect of apixaban on mortality is not confined to the on-treatment period.</p></div>

Distribution of Subjects with Fatal Stroke: Days from Final Stroke to Death (N=102)</head><p>Horizontal axis is days between adjudicated final stroke and adjudicated death due to stroke. Vertical axis represents the number of subjects at each time point.</p><p>Notably, despite the narrowing of the difference in deaths between the treatment arms after treatment, the hazard ratio for death (apixaban vs. warfarin) is not worse ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1)</ref>.</p><p>Also, while the following data from other trials do not directly address the issue of the prolongation of the apparent effect of apixaban, they are reassuring in that they indicated the pattern of timing with respect to treatment of deaths vs. primary endpoint events in ARISTOTLE is not unique.</p><p>In ARISTOTLE a large number of deaths occurred after the end of treatment, a pattern that was not observed for the primary endpoint events. The ratio of primary endpoint events in the on treatment period (i.e., first dose to last dose + 2 days) vs. those in the ITT period was 401:444, or 0.84. Because this ratio is reasonably close to unity, it should not be surprising that the differences in primary endpoint events between the treatment arms (warfarin minus apixaban) were similar in the two periods (53 and 49 in the ITT and on-treatment analyses, respectively). However, the ratio of deaths during the on treatment period vs. the ITT period was 561:1272, or 0.44.</p><p>It is not clear why the ratio of deaths in the on-treatment period vs. ITT period is higher for primary endpoint events than for deaths. Better ascertainment of death than stroke after treatment may account for some of the difference, but it seems likely that discontinuation of study drug because of a serious illness (such as a stroke) that eventually was fatal accounted for some of the difference (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 1</ref> to <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> and associated text above).</p><p>A similar pattern regarding the proportion of primary endpoint events vs. deaths that occurred on-treatment was observed in ROCKET and RE-LY, which were warfarincontrolled trials of rivaroxaban and dabigatran, respectively, performed in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2)</ref>. Primary endpoint events were defined similarly in all 3 trials. As in ARISTOTLE, in both ROCKET and RE-LY the ratio of total deaths Page 8 on treatment vs. deaths during the ITT period was substantially lower than the analogous ratio for primary endpoint events: 0.37 vs. 0.75 respectively for ROCKET and 0.55 vs. 0.74 respectively for RE-LY. </p></div>

Only for lost to follow-up is the date of last contact to be recorded on this CRF. For death there is the death form with a field for date of death, but what about "withdrew consent" or "other" or even "complete"? It is easy to document that "visit date" for "withdrew consent" likely does not represent the date on which the patient visited the site or withdrew consent. For example, one patient discontinued treatment on 16jul00 with the last verifiable events on 18jun00. However, the disposition (DS) dataset has a "Start Date/Time of Disposition Event" for withdrew consent of 12apr11 and the sponsor counts the patient as completing follow-up, censoring on 30jan11. Withdrawing consent on 12apr11, long after the trial ended, is not rational and would not represent a withdrawal of consent during the ITT period, as the sponsor classifies this patient. Another patient is similar, with end of treatment and last events on 06may10 but withdrawal of consent allegedly on 24feb11 with sponsor's censoring on 30jan11. I count both of these patients (and other similar ones) as having incomplete vital status follow-up, partially explaining and justifying why my estimate of incompleteness of vital status follow-up is higher than the sponsor's.</p><p>There are other examples of anomalous dates, e.g., at least three patients have dates of last contact by "direct contact with subject" long after the patient was reported dead. In fact, about 65% of patients who died have a visit date or other date greater than the date of death. Furthermore, for patients who did not die during the study, we do not have an unequivocal last date against which to check the validity of reported dates. There is no good way to detect or resolve many of these date inconsistencies even with a painstaking manual review of the CRFs-and we do not have most of the CRFs. Any estimates of completeness of vital status follow-up are optimistic.</p><p>Fragility of the Death Benefit in ARISTOTLE While the estimates of missing vital status follow-up are concerning (&gt;3%) and likely higher, how do they relate quantitatively to the reported death benefit? The sponsor claims that there were statistically significantly fewer deaths in the apixaban arm than in the warfarin arm in ARISTOTLE based on the analysis in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> excerpted from the clinical study report: The p-value is close to 0.05 and the upper confidence limit for the hazard ratio is 1.00 so we know that this result is very fragile. How fragile? A change in only one death (one more with apixaban or one fewer with warfarin) could make this result nominally statistically insignificant. This critical number 1 is dwarfed by 317, the estimated-but still likely optimistic-number of patients with missing vital status in the apixaban arm. Even the total difference in deaths</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bleeding and Cancer</head><p>Background I raised the issue of whether a drug that affects bleeding might also affect cancer rates in my review of prasugrel, a platelet inhibitor. The details of the data and my discussion are available in the Medical Reviews, Parts 18 to 23, available at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/ drugsatfda_docs/nda/2009/022307s000TOC.cfm. I summarize the findings with prasugrel below for ease of reference.</p><p>I analyzed solid cancer rates in the large TRITON outcomes trial of prasugrel vs. clopidogrel in acute coronary syndromes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Wiviott, Braunwald et al. 2007</ref>) because my interpretation of the prasugrel 24-month mouse carcinogenicity study was that prasugrel may be a tumor promoter for a wide variety of solid cancers. To my surprise the solid cancer event rates by arm in TRITON showed the strikingly different incidence curves shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: Times to First Solid Cancer* Events in the Prasugrel TRITON StudyFigure 4. 9 effect of all platelet inhibitors, or an effect of drugs that increase bleeding. While my preliminary analyses of older clopidogrel studies did not confirm a similar effect, I analyzed the FDA submissions for new, potent platelet inhibitors and for new anticoagulants. My preliminary analyses of the trials of new anticoagulants showed reasonably consistent results: Whatever arm had more bleeding had more solid cancer events and the solid cancers were deadly.</p><p>I had developed a rigorous methodology for ascertaining cancer events in CV outcome trials for a meta-analysis of angiotensin receptor blockers and cancer. FDA staff can access the review plan with the details of the methodology for this latter meta-analysis under Tracked Safety Issue 935 in a DARRTS communication filed August 31, 2012. Following as closely as possible the rigorous methodology I ascertained cancer events in the APPRAISE-2 and ARISTOTLE trials of apixaban. For the first version of this review I used analysis datasets for APPRAISE-2 provided by the sponsor in an early NDA submission. For this version I used the more detailed SDTM datasets provided in a later submission. The APPRAISE-2 cancer findings did not change for this second version, although from the SDTM datasets I did identify one additional apixaban patient with a gastrointestinal tumor likely malignant but not documented unequivocally as malignant.</p><p>I have not yet performed a rigorous ascertainment of cancer events in a third large apixaban outcome trial, AVERROES. <ref type="bibr">(Connolly, Eikelboom et al. 2011</ref>) AVERROES was a randomized, double-blind trial of apixaban vs. aspirin in patients with atrial fibrillation unsuitable for warfarin therapy. AVERROES was terminated early for a benefit favoring apixaban. Major bleeding rates were not significantly different between the apixaban and aspirin groups so the cancer findings may not be relevant to the question of bleeding and cancer. I will do a rigorous analysis of AVERROES in the future. I present the cancer findings for APPRAISE-2 and ARISTOTLE below.</p><p>Solid Cancers in APPRAISE-2 APPRAISE-2 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of apixaban added to standard antiplatelet therapy in patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alexander, Lopes et al. 2011)</ref> The trial was terminated early because of a higher rate of major bleeding events in the apixaban arm without a counterbalancing reduction in ischemic events. The apixaban/placebo hazard ratio for TIMI major bleeding was 2.59 (95% CI 1.5-4.5).</p><p>Rates of solid cancer events were higher in the apixaban arm as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.</p><p>responding to a related issue: The issue of whether angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are associated with increased cancer rates, as raised by a 2010 published meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Sipahi, Debanne et al. 2010)</ref>, remains unanswered today. The June 2, 2011, FDA safety communication (available at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm257516.htm) that cleared ARBs is based on an inadequately-specified and flawed FDA meta-analysis, including counting "malignant lung neoplasm" but not "lung carcinoma" as lung cancers. I documented the many problems with the FDA meta-analysis in reviews (available to FDA staff) filed in DARRTS on <ref type="bibr">July 20, 2012, and</ref><ref type="bibr">August 31, 2012, under</ref> Tracked Safety Issue 935. I proposed analyzing the ARB trials rigorously but was discouraged by Dr. Ellis Unger, the Office Director, in the email reproduced in Attachment 1. The portion of that email most relevant to bleeding and cancer is the following quotation:</p><p>"Third, if you were to go ahead with this and find a RR of, say 1.3, I doubt there would be much enthusiasm for basing a regulatory decision (labeling or otherwise) on that. People would have various opinions on where the meaningful threshold is, but it might be worth asking for some input before you start."</p><p>I find it disturbing that Dr. Unger expressed a lack of concern about a drug increasing the risk of cancer by 30%. We routinely accept smaller efficacy benefits and our advisory committee has consistently refused to set a minimum magnitude for an acceptable benefit. We mandate that diabetic drugs not increase cardiovascular risk by 30%. That limit was partially based on practicality of trials-most clinicians would prefer a lower risk limit if the sizes of the resulting trials were feasible. I assert that any validated risk of cancer is concerning for a hypertensive drug used chronically for which there are many alternatives-or for anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs used chronically. We should inform practitioners and patients about the risks of drugs so that they can make an informed decision and that they can institute follow-up measures to minimize the risks. I have proceeded in time available with the rigorous analysis of the ARB trials.</p><p>My review did invoke a response from Dr. Unger. I've included his response, and my response to it, as Attachment 2. I believe my response in Attachment 2 addresses well his reasons for not pursuing these critical cancer issues. My recommendations below remain unchanged.</p><p>I recommend the following:</p><p>ï‚· The data regarding bleeding and cancer should be presented and discussed at an advisory committee meeting. If the rigorous analysis of the ARB trials confirms a risk for ARBs and cancer, then the data regarding ARBs and cancer should also be presented and discussed at an advisory committee meeting. It may be advantageous to have both topics addressed at the same meeting.</p><p>ï‚· The data regarding bleeding and cancer should be included in the apixaban label and in the labels for all antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs. If the advisory committee meeting discussing bleeding and cancer is scheduled promptly then the labeling regarding bleeding and cancer can be delayed until after the meeting.</p><p>flaw that prevents capturing the identities of SAEs. We can eliminate trials with the latter problems. If the trials with reasonable SAE capture approaches and adequate follow-up consistently show a cancer risk, then we can have confidence that there is a real problem. Your alleged problems would represent noise that would likely obscure real risks and produce inconsistent results from trial to trial, not consistently show a risk. Finally, cancer is easier to document than the cardiac events that have proved useful in identifying CV risk-and efficacy!--of many drugs.</p><p>ï‚· ". . . where there is strong potential for ascertainment bias (bleeding can lead to tumor discovery) . . ." Note that this remark does not apply to ARBs and cancer, the original context of your 1.3 RR remark. I agree that there is a potential for ascertainment bias due to bleeding. However, that potential does not appear to explain the cancer risks observed because the cancer incidence curves continue to diverge for the durations of all studies and the cancer survival in each study is the same in all arms despite the increased cancer rate in the arm with more bleeding. If ascertainment bias played a major role we would expect the cancer incidence curves to converge and survival to be prolonged in the arm with more bleeding, if only by a lead time bias if not also because of earlier detection with higher rates of cure. The question of how much ascertainment bias plays a role is precisely the reason why we need to analyze the vast amounts of data we have more thoroughly and present and discuss the results openly at an advisory committee meeting.</p><p>ï‚· ". . . where there is no reasonably plausible underlying mechanism of action . . ." The FDA has never required, and should not require, a plausible mechanism of action for a safety issue. However, there are plausible mechanisms of action for both of these cancer risk issues. I would be happy to discuss them.</p><p>Finally, you have identified potentially legitimate but unsupported "uncertainties" in my proposals. However, there is one issue about which there is no uncertainty: Not counting lung carcinomas as lung cancers in the FDA meta-analysis of ARBs and cancer is wrong. The FDA safety communication of June 2, 2011, that cleared ARBs is based on that poorly executed and seriously flawed meta-analysis. That safety communication is long overdue for correction and the relationship of bleeding to cancer is long overdue for characterization and public dissemination. Determining completeness of follow-up has one complication: The type of follow-up typically varies in outcome studies. For patients who have a face-to-face study visit with the investigator on or after the study end date follow-up is complete for all study outcomes or events. However, for some patients final follow-up may consist of a phone call with the patient or a spouse or a primary physician, for others a report of a hospitalization, and for still others a newspaper obituary or a registry report of alive or dead. The level of detail available from these latter, nonface-to-face follow-ups varies and, while usually adequate for determining vital status, may not be adequate for ascertaining endpoints or adverse events. I recommend estimating two levels of completeness of follow-up: (1) vital status; and (2) events. For the former I accept any type of documented follow-up having a date unambiguously referencing the patient as alive. For the latter I accept reports of documented face-to-face visits, hospitalizations or other events, and phone calls with documented queries regarding events. Because of ambiguities in case report</p></div>

I estimated completeness of event follow-up based on events, procedures, vital sign recordings, and last direct contacts with the patient (i.e., the types of reports relevant to events, endpoint or adverse, or the absence thereof) but not counting the flawed status report visit dates. For these reports about 15% of patients, or over 2,700 patients, have incomplete follow-up. Compare 1,351, the number of apixaban patients with incomplete follow-up, to 53, the difference in primary endpoints. There is a vast amount of missing follow-up in which endpoints may be hidden or missed.</p><p>COMMENT: The alleged death benefit of apixaban compared to warfarin is fragile as reported by the sponsor, i.e., p = 0.046, a change in only one death rendering the difference statistically insignificant. Furthermore, the validity of this fragile benefit depends upon having 100% valid data. The substantial missing vital status follow-up, the problems with date recordings, and the lack of a significant death benefit for warfarin destroy confidence that apixaban reduces allcause mortality. We might have some confidence that apixaban reduces stroke rates in atrial fibrillation: Stroke reduction with warfarin is substantial and allegedly apixaban improves upon the warfarin reductions. However, our confidence in the apixaban stroke benefit is also reduced by the substantial missing event follow-up as well as by the data quality issue identified by the primary reviewers, i.e., errors in the dispensing of the study drug or documentation thereof. I, like most FDA reviewers, would like to conclude that apixaban is effective in atrial fibrillation-we would like to have alternatives to warfarin. While there are problems with the ARISTOTLE data, the stroke results are reasonably in the right direction and our priors are that a drug with an anticoagulant pharmacodynamic action should be effective. I consider it to be very unfortunate that ARISTOTLE, like many other recent outcome trials, has substantial problems with data quality. Some of the responsibility for the data quality problems rests with us, the FDA: We have approved drugs ignoring similar data quality issues, granting superiority claims and not discussing in the labels the data quality issues. We must stop doing this.</p><p>If we approve apixaban I recommend the following for the labeling:</p><p>ï‚· The indication statement should include only stroke and systemic embolism.</p><p>ï‚· .</p><p>ï‚· The Clinical Studies section of the label should include a discussion of the data quality problems in ARISTOTLE. It should summarize the dispensing errors and provide the missing follow-up statistics for both vital status and events. It should report that a change in one death eliminates the statistical significance of the death benefit and that, because of the missing data, we can not have confidence in a death benefit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bleeding and Cancer</head><p>Background I raised the issue of whether a drug that affects bleeding might also affect cancer rates in my review of prasugrel, a platelet inhibitor. The details of the data and my discussion are available in the Medical Reviews, Parts 18 to 23, available at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/ drugsatfda docs/nda/2009/022307s000TOC.cfm. I summarize the findings with prasugrel below for ease of reference.</p><p>I analyzed solid cancer rates in the large TRITON outcomes trial of prasugrel vs. clopidogrel in acute coronary syndromes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Wiviott, Braunwald et al. 2007</ref>) because my interpretation of the prasugrel 24-month mouse carcinogenicity study was that prasugrel may be a tumor promoter for a wide variety of solid cancers. To my surprise the solid cancer event rates by arm in TRITON showed the strikingly different incidence curves shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: Times to First Solid Cancer* Events in the Prasugrel TRITON StudyFigure 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>8</head><p>Reference ID: 3229396 (b) <ref type="bibr">(4)</ref> responding to a related issue: The issue of whether angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are associated with increased cancer rates, as raised by a 2010 published meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Sipahi, Debanne et al. 2010)</ref>, remains unanswered today. The June 2, 2011, FDA safety communication (available at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm257516.htm) that cleared ARBs is based on an inadequately-specified and flawed FDA meta-analysis, including counting "malignant lung neoplasm" but not "lung carcinoma" as lung cancers. I documented the many problems with the FDA meta-analysis in reviews (available to FDA staff) filed in DARRTS on <ref type="bibr">July 20, 2012, and</ref><ref type="bibr">August 31, 2012, under</ref> Tracked Safety Issue 935. I proposed analyzing the ARB trials rigorously but was discouraged by Dr. Ellis Unger, the Office Director, in the email reproduced in the Attachment. The portion of that email most relevant to bleeding and cancer is the following quotation:</p><p>"Third, if you were to go ahead with this and find a RR of, say 1.3, I doubt there would be much enthusiasm for basing a regulatory decision (labeling or otherwise) on that. People would have various opinions on where the meaningful threshold is, but it might be worth asking for some input before you start."</p><p>I find it disturbing that Dr. Unger expressed a lack of concern about a drug increasing the risk of cancer by 30%. We routinely accept smaller efficacy benefits and our advisory committee has consistently refused to set a minimum magnitude for an acceptable benefit. We mandate that diabetic drugs not increase cardiovascular risk by 30%. That limit was partially based on practicality of trials-most clinicians would prefer a lower risk limit if the sizes of the resulting trials were feasible. I assert that any validated risk of cancer is concerning for a hypertensive drug used chronically for which there are many alternatives-or for anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs used chronically. We should inform practitioners and patients about the risks of drugs so that they can make an informed decision and that they can institute follow-up measures to minimize the risks. I have proceeded in time available with the rigorous analysis of the ARB trials.</p><p>I recommend the following:</p><p>ï‚· The data regarding bleeding and cancer should be presented and discussed at an advisory committee meeting. If the rigorous analysis of the ARB trials confirms a risk for ARBs and cancer, then the data regarding ARBs and cancer should also be presented and discussed at an advisory committee meeting. It may be advantageous to have both topics addressed at the same meeting.</p><p>ï‚· The data regarding bleeding and cancer should be included in the apixaban label and in the labels for all antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs. If the advisory committee meeting discussing bleeding and cancer is scheduled promptly then the labeling regarding bleeding and cancer can be delayed until after the meeting. First, this would represent a lot of man-hours, so I have to assume that there is a paucity of work in the Division at this point, or that you will be doing this mostly after hours.</p><p>Second, when we get into writing analytic plans, and specifically plans for adjudicating clinical endpoints, the plan/protocol might need to be reviewed at a high level -i.e., the OND IO or higher. There is a MAPP on this, I believe. You should consult that MAPP before you start any work to see if it applies here. If it applies, the protocol will need to go up to for review and comment before you begin.</p><p>Third, if you were to go ahead with this and find a RR of, say 1.3, I doubt there would be much enthusiasm for basing a regulatory decision (labeling or otherwise) on that. People would have various opinions on where the meaningful threshold is, but it might be worth asking for some input before you start.</p><p>Finally, given you familiarity with some of the trial data, any decision YOU make regarding inclusion and exclusion of trials can be called into question after the fact. It doesn't matter that your criteria are reasonable and defensible, because you can know the effect that your criteria will have on the trials to be included/excluded before you begin.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is a representation of an electronic record that was signed electronically and this page is the manifestation of the electronic signature. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Executive Summary</head><p>The Applicant has responded to our Complete Response (CR) letter of 6/22/2012 and addressed each of the 6 items in that letter. Most importantly, the Applicant has provided the requested information relating to medication errors from an additional 20% of bottle labels from ARISTOTLE study sites randomly selected by FDA. When combined with the 12% of bottle labels from randomly selected sites previously collected to satisfy the EMA, these bottle labels comprise the Applicant's "Combined Random Sample" of bottle labels. Due to conservative sampling practices, the Combined Random Sample includes 155,038 labels, representing about 35.5% of the bottles dispensed at all sites in the study.</p><p>The Applicant compared the serial number on each legible label to the IVRS record of bottles that were to be dispensed to the subject and generated rates of "Type 1" errors involving dispensing a bottle with a serial number not assigned to the subject (regardless of the bottle contents) and also a subset of Type 1 errors termed "Type 2" errors, in which the unassigned bottle contained the wrong medication or the wrong dose of active apixaban. All dispensations associated with illegible labels or missing labels were imputed to be Type 1 errors and either 50% or 100% of such dispensations were imputed as Type 2 errors. Type 2 errors had potentially serious implications for subjects, because nearly all Type 2 errors resulted in a subject receiving either two placebos or two active drugs for the period in which the subject took study drug from the bottle dispensed in error, thereby increasing the subject's risk of stroke or bleeding, respectively.</p><p>Labels representing over 99% of dispensations at the sampled sites in the Combined Random Sample were collected, and over 99% of collected labels were legible. The bottle-level error rate among bottles with legible labels was about 0.18% and 0.25% in the apixaban and warfarin arms, respectively. When imputed errors for illegible or missing labels are included, the bottle level error rate was 0.9% and 1.1% in the apixaban and warfarin arms, respectively. With the absolute worst case assumption that each missing or illegible label corresponded to a Type 2 error, the subject level error rate (i.e., the percentage of subjects who received at least one Type 2 error bottle) was 12.2% and 12.4% in the apixaban and warfarin arms, respectively.</p><p>Using worst case models of the effects of errors on outcomes (i.e., assuming that all errors either increased the rate of the primary efficacy endpoint, time to stroke or systemic embolism rate in the warfarin arm, or alternatively, increased the rate of primary safety endpoint, time to ISTH major bleeding, in the warfarin arm), we compared the worst case per subject error rates of about 12% to the error rates that would be required to negate superiority for apixaban to warfarin for the primary efficacy and safety endpoints. Dr. S. Bai (Office of Biostatistics) calculated that 13 fewer strokes or systemic emboli in the warfarin arm would negate superiority for the efficacy endpoint, and 86 fewer major bleeds in the warfarin arm would negate superiority for ISTH major bleeding. If all errors occurred in the warfarin arm, and all modeled errorinduced events were eliminated from the analysis, it would take per-subject Type 2 error rates of over 20% (i.e., considerably greater than our worst case error estimate) to negate either superiority for either the primary efficacy or primary safety endpoint, <ref type="bibr">Page 3</ref> assuming that the rate of the relevant endpoint during the period that the subject took study drug from the erroneously dispensed bottle was 5 times the observed rate in the study for the warfarin arm. Thus, superiority of apixaban over warfarin for the primary efficacy and safety endpoints persisted despite highly unlikely, worst case models of the effects on event rates of highly unlikely, worst case error rates.</p><p>We also requested information regarding manual changes to an IVRS database held by a contractor that involved changing treatment assignment in the database after medication errors were discovered. We were concerned that these changes might have affected the randomization database. The sponsor submitted convincing information that the randomization data were not affected.</p><p>The CR letter also included requests for information relating to:</p><p>ï‚· Unblinding of the scratch-off panel of the bottle labels ï‚· The intensity of monitoring of key eCRF fields, including drug accountability information ï‚· Database inconsistencies with eCRFs observed in connection with our review of the medication error information ï‚· Inconsistencies in the adverse event database, consisting of multiple entries for what appeared to be the same adverse event</p><p>The responses provided by the Applicant were sufficient to allay our concerns about the implications of these issues for the approvability of the application.</p><p>Recommendation: The application should be approved. We recommend that labeling describe that apixaban was superior to warfarin for the primary efficacy and safety endpoints as well as mortality. A revised draft of labeling is the eRoom.</p><p>In addition to our review of the Applicant's complete response, this review includes discussions of several safety issues not raised in the original clinical review of May 22, 2012. None of these issues affects our recommendation regarding approval. There is also an expanded discussion of the mortality data in the application, which in the opinion of this reviewer (MR) supports inclusion of data and language in Sec. 14 of labeling indicating that apixaban was significantly superior to warfarin for allcause mortality in ARISTOTLE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head><p>The Applicant submitted this NDA for the reduction in the rate of stroke and systemic embolism in subjects with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation on 9/28/2011. The proposed indication . After a 3 month extension of the review clock Page 4 because of a major submission late in the review cycle, we sent a Complete Response (CR) letter on 6/22/2012, with the following comments and requests:</p><p>"We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we cannot approve the application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and provided recommendations to address these issues.</p><p>1. As you are aware, some subjects in ARISTOTLE were given the wrong study drug (e.g. active instead of placebo and vice-versa). Knowledge of the study drugs actually dispensed to subjects is crucial to understanding the outcomes of the study. While we recognize your efforts to better define the rate and nature of dosing errors, which suggest a lower rate than initially reported, we believe the information you have submitted for us to review has not adequately characterized the frequency of errors in dispensing study drugs. Before we can approve your NDA you will need to submit reliable information regarding the following:</p><p>ï‚· The frequency of a subject in ARISTOTLE receiving the wrong study medication, specifically:</p><p>a. dispensing active warfarin instead of placebo warfarin to a subject randomized to apixaban;</p><p>b. dispensing active apixaban instead of placebo apixaban to a subject randomized to warfarin;</p><p>c. dispensing placebo apixaban instead of apixaban to a subject randomized to apixaban;</p><p>d. dispensing placebo warfarin instead of warfarin to a subject randomized to warfarin, and e. dispensing the wrong dose of apixaban to a subject randomized to apixaban ï‚· The frequency of dispensing to a subject a bottle with a serial number other than the one assigned by the interactive voice response system (IVRS).</p><p>ï‚· The frequency with which the serial number on the tear-off label from a study drug bottle did not match the IVRS assigned serial number.</p><p>ï‚· The frequency with which the IVRS assigned serial number did not match each of the following and any one of the following: the eCRF entry of the serial number of dispensed study drug bottles, the eCRF entry of the serial number of returned study drug bottles, and the eCRF entry of the serial number of study drug bottles brought in to a visit but not returned.</p><p>You should use whatever sources of information you have available to respond to our requests. We believe that the best source of information for responding to the first two bulleted items requested above is the tear off labels on which are printed the serial numbers of the study drug bottles. You may choose to collect all of these labels from investigative sites. However you recently submitted to us a summary report (but not the full report) you prepared for the European Medicines Agency (EMA), detailing your assessment of the errors in dispensing Page 5 study drugs in a random 12% sample of subjects. The full report of this assessment might constitute an adequate response to our requests above, or may serve as a template for designing a response to our requests. A brief review of the summary report raises some questions that will need to be addressed if the full report is used to respond to our requests. For example, your analysis included only legible labels whereas it seems to us that a bottle with a difficult to read label is more likely to be dispensed in error. You assert in the report you prepared for EMA that the frequency of a wrong study drug being dispensed to a subject was less than 0.1%. If the frequency is much greater than that, we may have additional requests for information. One of those will be identification of all primary endpoint events, deaths, and ISTH major bleeds that occur at times a subject may have been on two active study drugs or no active study drug. Another will be determining the frequency with which site monitoring identified and did not identify a subject whose eCRF indicates they may have been dispensed a bottle with an incorrect serial number.</p><p>2. Investigators in the ARISTOTLE study were supposed to report all instances in which they scratched off a coating on the tear-off labels to unblind a subject. We do not believe you have checked tear-off labels to verify that all instances of unblinding by investigators were reported in the 12% sample. If you have not done so, submit a plan to us to determine the frequency of unblinding by the investigator not reported to you. If the frequency is more than minimal, we may have additional requests.</p><p>3. In submissions to your NDA, you describe the intensity with which certain eCRF fields were monitored and checked during the conduct of ARISTOTLE. For example, you have told us that the entry on the eCRF listing the serial number of the bottle dispensed was subjected to more intense monitoring and edit checks than the entry listing the serial number of the bottle returned. To help us understand these different procedures, you need to provide us with all plans used to monitor and verify the accuracy of the entries on the eCRF. We note that the final monitoring plan you submitted in your NDA was dated after data-lock, and so may not have been a working plan actually used during the conduct of ARISTOTLE. You should provide the initial monitoring plan with all subsequent changes to that plan, both formal and informal. Indicate when and how changes in monitoring were implemented. Include all communications to sites, and identify the organizations responsible for all monitoring in the original monitoring plan and any changes made.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.</head><p>You recently informed us that manual changes were made to a dataset containing the serial numbers of bottles assigned by the IVRS to subjects in ARISTOTLE. You stated that these changes were made in response to information provided by investigators directly to the IVRS vendor, to ensure that a bottle dispensed in error would be removed from inventory so it could not be assigned.</p><p>Manual changes to the IVRS concern us because of the possibility of alterations to the randomization dataset. You therefore should provide the following:</p><p>ï‚· All agreements between BMS and concerning the role of in the conduct of ARISTOTLE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Page 6</head><p>ï‚· All SOPs from related to the conditions under which manual changes to data from the IVRS could be made and the documentation required to do so.</p><p>ï‚· An IVRS dataset that flags all subjects whose original IVRS-assigned bottle serial number was later changed, the serial number originally assigned and the altered serial number, and the reason for the change. Original IVRS datasets with codes to create the dataset (kitassgn) that was provided to the Agency may be helpful.</p><p>ï‚· Most importantly, an audit trail of the changes indicating who, when and why manual changes were made to the data set containing IVRS assigned bottle serial numbers. If the changes were made in response to information provided by an investigative site, please include the communication from the site documenting the information provided.</p><p>ï‚· A statement signed by responsible individuals that no changes were made to the randomization dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.</head><p>We are concerned that the trial datasets submitted in your NDA do not accurately reflect the information in the eCRFs. In our brief review of your medication error dataset (smed.xpt) (used for most of your medication error analyses), we identified an observation with a valid date in the eCRF that was misrepresented by a period in the dataset, indicating that a valid date was missing. We also found medication data (indicating that drug was dispensed and taken until the end of treatment) for which there were no corresponding eCRFs in one subject. We can provide more details concerning these mismatches on request.</p><p>We are concerned about these errors because they were found after a cursory examination of these datasets, leading us to believe that there may be important errors in the datasets used for critical analyses. You should explain how these and similar errors, if any, occurred. If you believe that the datasets for important analyses are accurate, please provide the basis for your belief.</p><p>6. Some subjects have a unique adverse event listed multiple times as both nonserious and serious. This appears to be because the site personnel completed a non-serious AE CRF and a serious adverse event (SAE) CRF for the same event.</p><p>You should prepare an adverse event analysis dataset (adae.xpt) in which all adverse events are listed a single time with the correct designation as serious or non-serious.</p><p>We expect that you will anticipate and answer any reasonable questions we are likely to have after reviewing the information you submit in your complete response."</p><p>We met with the Applicant on July 16, 2012 (minutes dated August 2) to discuss these requests and their plans for a response. We also sent a follow-up general advice letter on August 9. The sponsor's response to the CR was substantially complete on September 17, and on September 26 we sent a letter classifying the September 17 submission as a Class 2 Resubmission, with a goal date of March 17, 2013. This is primarily a review of the resubmission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Page 7</head><p>For additional information about the rationale for the CR letter and the above requests for information, see the initial Clinical Review of this NDA dated 5/22/2012, the Cross Disciplinary Team Leader review and the Division Director's memo, both dated 6/22/2012.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Review of Submitted Responses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Request 1</head><p>Request 1 related to the frequency of dispensing errors. These errors fall into 2 general types:</p><p>The subject received a bottle with a serial number not identical to one allocated to the subject by the IVRS system (called "Type 1"). The bottle may or may not have contained the wrong medication for the subject.</p><p>The subject received a bottle of the wrong medication (or the wrong dose of apixaban) (called "Type 2"). The bottle would necessarily bear a serial number different from the one allocated to the subject by the IVRS. Type 2 errors are a subset of Type 1 errors.</p><p>Type 1 errors may or may not be medically important, but in all cases reflect dispensing errors at the site. Type 2 errors would be potentially medically important to the subject who received the wrong bottle. This was a double dummy study in which each subject received an active drug (either apixaban or warfarin) and a placebo for the other treatment. Warfarin and apixaban bottles and labels appeared quite different. Most Type 2 errors involved substitution of a placebo for an assigned active drug (e.g., warfarin placebo instead of warfarin active) or vice versa. A subject who received a placebo version of the assigned active drug would be taking 2 placebos for a period of several weeks to 3 months if the error was not caught, and would be at higher risk for stroke or systemic embolism during this period. A subject who received an active drug instead of the assigned placebo would be taking 2 actives and be at higher risk of bleeding. A subject in the active apixaban arm who received the wrong active dose could be at greater risk of stroke or bleeding, depending on whether the subject was supposed to receive the 5 mg dose (but received 2.5 mg tablets) or the 2.5 mg dose (but received 5 mg tablets), respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sources of Data</head><p>The discussion below focuses primarily on error information derived from the partial set of bottle label tear-off panels (which include the bottle serial number and a bar code) collected by the Sponsor from randomly selected study sites. We will refer to these as "labels." The Sponsor collected all available labels from randomly selected sites in two waves. The "First Random Sample" included about 12% of all dispensed labels, and was collected late in the initial review cycle. It was done in response to a request by the EMA. After that, the "Confirmatory Random Sample" was collected in response to the CR letter and was intended to include another 20% of dispensed labels. The combination of these two samples, termed the "Combined Random Sample," is the primary focus of this analysis. Both samples consisted of labels from sites randomly selected to provide the target number of labels. All labels at selected sites were to be submitted. In the case of First Random Sample, BMS ran the site selection program. In the case of the Confirmatory Random Sample, FDA ran the site selection program. Due to conservative sampling practices intended to assure that at least the targeted number of legible labels were collected, the Combined Random Sample included 155,038 labels, representing about 35.5% of the 436,182 bottles dispensed at all sites in the study, somewhat more than the combined target of 32% of labels.</p><p>In addition to these labels, the Sponsor had another 8% of labels, termed the "Convenience Sample" that were provided to the Sponsor in error, with more than 80% of these coming from sites in Russia. Presumably, the CRO that serviced sites in Russia provided erroneous information to the sites about the need to submit these labels to the sponsor. These labels were available prior to the CR letter, and analyses of error data from the Convenience Sample are included in our initial medical review of 5/22/2012. These labels are not included in most of the analyses discussed below because of the non-random nature of the sample.</p><p>Information on the processes used to collect these samples and enter data is found in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, copied from the sponsor's submission. The "investigations" of bottle label mismatches and missing labels mentioned in the table are discussed further below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1. Processes Used to Collect Bottle Labels and Record Data</head><p>Although we requested analyses of error rates based on several sources of information regarding what was dispensed to the subject, the reviewers believe that the most accurate source of information regarding dispensing is the tear-off portion of the bottle label that was removed from the label at the time of dispensing and retained at the site on either a hard copy of CRF page 800 or in the subject file. The sponsor regarded these labels as the source data for information entered by the site into the eCRF dispensing field and the drug dispensing logs that were kept at the sites.  Data for disposition of the labels in the Combined Random Sample are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table  3</ref>. The collected labels accounted for more than 99% of the bottles dispensed at the sampled sites, and 99.9% of the collected labels had a discernible bottle number, determined either visually, or if not visually legible, by reading the bar code on the label with an electronic device. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The geographic origin of the bottles in the Combined Random Sample was reasonably consistent with the origin of subjects in the study overall. Also about 69% of the labels were from bottles of warfarin or matching placebo and 31% were from bottles of apixaban or matching placebo, consistent with the overall dispensing data for the trial ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 4)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The sponsor provided information on the barcode readers used to read visually illegible labels (all were Wasp Model 3509 Barcode Readers manufactured by Wasp Barcode Technologies). For validation, each of the 9 barcode readers purchased by BMS was used to read 100 visually legible ARISTOTLE bottle labels (different labels were used to validate each reader). Three readers were tested at each BMS site that received bottle labels (2 in the US and one in Belgium). The visually legible bottle serial number on each label was entered into a database and compared to the number obtained using the barcode reader, which was entered into the database electronically. Each reader was 100% accurate in matching the visually read serial numbers. The NDA submission suggests that the individually validated barcode readers were then used to read labels for the analyses described in this review.</p><p>Page 11  The applicant did not provide additional analyses on the demographics and diseaserelated parameters in subjects included in the Combined Random Sample. However, such analyses are of modest interest only, because the primary focus of these analyses is dispensation.</p><p>Note that site 386 in Belgium was one of the sites selected to be in the Confirmatory Random Sample. This site reportedly sent its bottle labels to BMS but they were lost in shipment. No copies were made prior to shipment. BMS considered these labels to be "non-informative missing data," and they were excluded from all analyses.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The Applicant's treatment of the data from site 386 is acceptable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytic Methods</head><p>In general, bottle based error rates were calculated as E/D, where E represents the number of bottles erroneously dispensed (including actual errors and, in most analyses, also imputed errors) and D represents the number of dispensed bottles at the relevant sites included in the sample.</p><p>The method for determining whether an error occurred differed across analyses and will be described in connection with the analyses presented below.</p><p>The method for determining the count of dispensed bottles was consistent across most analyses. Unless otherwise indicated, a bottle was considered dispensed if one or more of the following events occurred:</p><p>a label existed or a site indicated that a container was dispensed a container was assigned by IVRS a container was entered in the eCRF as dispensed, even if it was not assigned by the IVRS.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: This method for determining dispensing events would tend to produce a larger denominator for error rate analyses than one based on only one source of data, such as the IVRS database. While this might slightly reduce the observed actual error rates, it would probably notably increase the rate of imputed errors, because in FDA's preferred analysis the number of imputed errors is equal to the number of dispensations minus the number of obtained legible labels. We think this is a reasonable worst-case approach since labels may not be missing at random, and because we think a missing or illegible label may be more likely to be associated with an error than one that is available and legible. This approach also gives the sponsor a strong incentive to minimize the number of uncollected labels or illegible labels.</p><p>In general, subject-based error rates were calculated as P e /N, where P e represents the number of subjects with one or more dispensing errors (again, usually including imputed errors) and N is the number of subjects who received one or more bottles of study drug at the sites included in the sample.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results of Dispensing Error Analyses Requested by FDA</head><p>The analyses of dispensing errors based on bottle labels that were requested by FDA in general had the following characteristics:</p><p>Analyses based on bottle labels attempted to account for missing and illegible bottle labels, assuming that such labels should not be considered to be "missing (or illegible) at random". In any case where a bottle was dispensed that could not be matched to a legible bottle label, it was assumed that a bottle with the wrong serial number was dispensed. Note that the vast majority of known dispensing errors involved the same type of bottle (i.e., if the IVRS-allocated bottle was active warfarin, another bottle of "warfarin" would in most cases be dispensed in the event of an error), with a 50% chance of the subject getting either placebo or active study drug. Accordingly, each imputed error involving dispensing of the wrong bottle was considered to result in 0.5 imputed dispensing errors involving the wrong medication.</p><p>A dispensing error based on a non-matching, missing, or illegible bottle label was counted as an error, even if other sources of information, such as the case report form or a medication log, indicated that the correct bottle might have been dispensed. Our rationale for this choice was that the bottle label represented the source document for what was dispensed. The CRF and the medication logs were filled in by site staff, perhaps the same site staff that dispensed a wrong bottle. It is possible that the site filled out these forms based on what was supposed to have been dispensed, not what was actually dispensed. Note the site received the allocated bottle number from the IVRS through a computer generated voice on the telephone and then within minutes to hours later, via a fax or email. If the fax or email was used as a source document, the sitegenerated record would match the IVRS regardless of what bottle was actually dispensed.</p><p>The sponsor provided analyses consistent with FDA's preference. The sponsor provided additional analyses in which other sources of information were used to negate errors based on the bottle labels.</p><p>In addition to the analyses of dispensing errors based on bottle labels, FDA requested analyses based on the eCRF records of bottles dispensed, returned, or "validated" (i.e., brought to the site for counting of tablets, and then taken home again by the subject) as the source of dispensing information (see above).</p><p>The sponsor also used other sources of information to negate dispensing errors found in these analyses.</p><p>Data for bottle-level type errors based on bottle labels (i.e., the subject received a bottle not assigned by the IVRS, regardless of what drug was contained in the bottle) is displayed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 5</ref>. About 0.2% of dispensations in each arm were associated with legible labels indicating that a subject received a bottle with the wrong serial number. Another 0.73% to 0.85% of dispensations in the apixaban and warfarin arms, respectively, were associated with missing labels (by the Applicant's definition, the term "missing labels" included illegible labels). In the worst case, if all missing labels are Page 14</p><p>imputed to be associated with bottle-level errors), the error rate is 0.9% in the apixaban arm and 1.1% in the warfarin arm. In the best case, if none of the missing labels were associated with errors, the error rates would be 0.18% and 0.25% in the apixaban and warfarin arms, respectively.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 6</ref> provides bottle-level data on the number of Type 2 errors (dispensing of the wrong medication to a subject). Over 99.0% of dispensations in each arm were associated with labels that decoded to the correct treatment. About 0.10% vs. 0.11% of labels for apixaban and warfarin subjects arms, respectively, decoded to the wrong treatment. Errors in the dispensing of warfarin (which in the table represents the incorrect active treatment for apixaban arm subjects and the incorrect placebo treatment for warfarin arm subjects) accounted for about 2/3 of the errors, consistent with the fact that more than twice as many bottles containing warfarin active or placebo were dispensed than bottles of apixaban active or placebo. Errors consisting of dispensing the wrong dose of active apixaban (5 mg tablets for 2.5 mg tablets, or vice-versa) were exceedingly rare. About 0.73% and 0.85% of labels were missing for the subjects in the apixaban and warfarin arms, respectively. If each of these missing labels was associated with a bottle not matching the IVRS allocated bottle, then about 50% of these labels would be associated with the wrong medicine. This follows because the typical Type 2 error was substitution of active for placebo of the same type or viceversa. Thus, 50% of missing labels were imputed to be associated with dispensing of the wrong medication. If the observed errors are combined with the imputed errors, the composite bottle level Type 2 error rate was 0.47% vs. 0.54% in the apixaban and warfarin arms, respectively.</p><p>Page 15  Over 99.8% subjects in each arm had at least one legible label. About 3.4% and 4.2% of subjects in the apixaban and warfarin arms, respectively, had at least one label with a serial number not matching an IVRS assigned serial number for that subject. About 10.8% of subjects in each arm had at least one missing label. No analysis on the overlap between subjects with non-matching labels and missing labels were provided. However, the information for Type 2 errors suggests that at least 17 subjects in the apixaban arm and 11 subjects in the warfarin arm had both observed medication errors and missing labels. If all missing labels are imputed to represent non-matching labels and only the 28 subjects described in the previous sentence had both a missing label and a non-matching label, then one can derive an estimate of subject-level Type 1</p><p>Page 16 errors. This estimate yields error rates of 13.7% and 14.6% in the apixaban and warfarin arms, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Type 2 errorssubject level:</head><p>When missing labels are ignored, over 97.8% of subjects in each arm had at least one legible label and received no labels corresponding to bottles containing the wrong medication. However, 10.79% and 10.75% of subjects in the apixaban and warfarin arms, respectively, had at least one missing label. In this case, we know the number of subjects who had at least one missing label and who received no known bottle with the medication ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 7</ref>). If we assume that 50% of missing labels are associated with the wrong medication, and that no person had more than one missing label, then the rate of Type 2 errors was 7.03% and 7.24% in the apixaban and warfarin arms, respectively. FDA agreed to accept the 50% rate based on verbal information from the sponsor that very few subjects had more than one missing label. However, it is now clear that a substantial number of subjects had more than one missing label. For example, there were 589 missing labels in the apixaban arm subjects, and 353 subjects had at least one missing label. Among those subjects, the mean number of missing labels was 589/353, or 1.67, but we did not calculate the distribution. In the warfarin arm, the analogous mean value is 1.83. For any individual, as the number of missing labels increases, the expected probability of receiving a bottle containing the wrong medication would increase. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Because we were not provided with the distribution of the missing labels, in addition to creating a composite of observed medication errors + imputed errors using a 50% rate for imputation, we also calculated the composite assuming that 100% of missing labels were associated with dispensing the wrong medicine. This absolute worst case scenario yielded Type 2 error rates of 12.16% and 12.44% in the apixaban and warfarin arms, respectively. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> If the probability of receiving the wrong medication associated with each missing label is p, then the probability of receiving at least one bottle of wrong medication for a subject with n missing labels is 1-(1-p) n For example, if the probability of receiving the wrong medication associated with each missing label is 0.5, then a subject with either 1, 2, or 3 missing labels would have a 50%, 75%, or 87.5% likelihood, respectively, of receiving at least one bottle of the wrong medication. 1 n = subjects with at least one legible label not matching IVRS + estimate of subjects with at least one missing label but without observed mismatch with IVRS assignments 2 n = subjects receiving a container of incorrect type + 0.5 x subjects with at least one missing label and without a study medication error in legible labels. 3 n = subjects receiving a container of incorrect type + 1.0 x subjects with at least one missing label and without a study medication error in legible labels S = number of subjects with at least one bottle dispensed, used as the denominator for all percentages NAnot applicable FDA also requested a bottle-level analysis of mismatches between bottle serial numbers entered into 3 eCRF fields vs. the IVRS allocated bottles. The 3 eCRF fields represented:</p><p>Page 18 ï‚· dispensed bottles, ï‚· returned bottles, and ï‚· "verified" bottles (i.e., bottles containing study medication brought in for tablet counts and then taken home again by the subject).</p><p>Data entry into these fields was performed manually at the site. Sites were not supplied with bar code readers. <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 8</ref> provides bottle-level data on Type 1 errors found when comparing bottle serial numbers in these 3 fields to the IVRS allocation for each treated subject. Per bottle Type 1 error rates varied widely depending on which of the 3 fields was compared to the IVRS file. The lowest error rates -0.05% to 0.07%were observed with the dispensed field. Error rates in the returned were more than 10 x error rates in the dispensed field. Error rates in the verified field were about 2 x the rates in the dispensed field. Note that these data were reviewed in our initial NDA review. It is also notable that all error rates in <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 8</ref> are lower than the composite bottle-level Type 1 error rates based on bottle labels in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 5</ref>.</p><p>The sponsor noted that about Â¾ of the errors represented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 8</ref> involved bottles apparently returned to the site that were never shipped to the site in question (based on the sponsor's shipping records). They argue that it was physically impossible for such a bottle to be dispensed from or returned to the site. They performed an analysis where such bottles were eliminated from the numerator and denominator ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">Table 9)</ref>. Error rates for all 3 eCRF fields were reduced from those displayed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 8</ref>, with the largest reduction observed in the returned field. Reviewer Comment: The reviewers agree that a bottle not shipped to a site was probably never dispensed to or returned by a subject at that site. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> However, it is not known what bottle was actually dispensed or returned in cases where the eCRF indicates that bottle shipped to another site was given to or returned by a subject. It seems possible that some other bottle at the site was mistakenly dispensed in cases where a bottle not shipped to the site appears in an eCRF field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Dispensing Error Analyses Submitted by the Applicant</head><p>We agreed that the Applicant could submit additional analyses beyond those that we requested, including those based on bottle labels that included only legible bottle labels and those that allowed elimination of errors in cases where site-created records (i.e., the eCRF or the dispensing logs) indicated that the correct bottle was dispensed, even if the bottle label indicated otherwise or was missing or illegible. They also corrected what they termed to be "label placement errors," which occurred when a bottle was correctly dispensed but the corresponding label was placed in the record of another subject at the site. The evidence supporting such corrections consisted of: Page 20</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual Subject Drug Logs</head><p>The following decision rule was used:</p><p>If the container number is uniquely identified in a Protocol Deviation Report, Site Monitoring Visit Report or other Site Correspondence, the subject identified as receiving the container in these records was assigned the container.</p><p>Otherwise, if the drug logs, the dispensed field of the eCRF data, and IVRS data are all consistent with this container being dispensed to another subject at the same site, and there is no evidence in the drug logs, dispensed field of the eCRF, and IVRS that the container was dispensed to the subject identified on the label page, the container was assigned to this other subject.</p><p>If a container cannot be uniquely re-assigned to a subject according to this process, it remained as entered in the label database associated with the subject as reported by the site.</p><p>In addition, the sponsor used the following techniques to eliminate alleged false positive bottle error determinations:</p><p>The sponsor used the eCRF entries and site drug logs to help "deduce" the serial number on illegible labels.</p><p>Sites were queried about all missing labels in attempt to determine if a bottle was actually dispensed in connection with a dispensing event that could not be matched to a label. The sites confirmed that 161/589 missing labels in the apixaban group and 128/462 missing labels in the warfarin group were associated with supposed dispensing events that did not occur.</p><p>The sponsor also made more favorable assumptions than FDA about the consequences of a missing label. FDA imputed all missing labels to be associated with Type 1 errors and initially 50% to be associated with dispensing of the wrong medication on a per bottle basis. The sponsor made a series of assumptions with Type 2 error rates ranging from 1 to 10 x the observed error rate for legible labels.</p><p>These various techniques led to error rates lower than those reported in the tables in this review. However, it is not necessary to provide additional details regarding the sponsor's analyses, because even if one accepts FDA's worst case assumptions, the error rates are very unlikely to have affected the treatment effects on the primary efficacy endpoint and the primary safety endpoint in ARISTOTLE, as discussed in the next section of this review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Potential Impact of Type 2 Errors on Key Study Outcomes</head><p>As noted in Sec. 3.1.1.2 of the initial Medical review, Dr. Steven Bai, the statistical reviewer for apixaban, calculated that it would take 13 fewer primary endpoint events (strokes or systemic emboli) in warfarin arm subjects to negate the finding that apixaban was superior to warfarin for the primary endpoint. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 10</ref>, copied from page 52 of the initial NDA review, reports the results of a simple model intended to explore the effects Page 21 of the additional primary endpoint events (strokes or systemic emboli) resulting from a worst case scenario of warfarin arm subjects receiving placebo for warfarin instead of warfarin. Such subjects were assumed to receive two placebos for 38 days, the mean duration of treatment with one bottle of warfarin. This was assumed to increase the event rate to either 3X or 5X the rate actually observed in the warfarin arm of ARISTOTLE (1.6 events/100 subject-years) for 38 days. With the expected 3X event rate (consistent with a 66% reduction in event rate with therapy compared to placebo, comparable to the results of the placebo-controlled trials of warfarin), it would require a per-subject error rate of &gt;40% in the warfarin arm, with no analogous errors (i.e., a subject receiving 2 placebos) in the apixaban arm, to negate the finding of superiority of apixaban for the primary endpoint. If a 5X event rate were to result from taking 2 placebos, it would take a &gt;20% per-subject error rate in the warfarin arm, with no analogous errors in the apixaban arm to negate superiority for the primary endpoint. However, the highest per-subject error rates calculated in connection with this review, even using worst case (and very unlikely) assumptions regarding missing data, are displayed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 7</ref>. The composite rate of observed and imputed Type 2 subject-level errors was 12.16% and 12.44% in the apixaban and warfarin arms, respectively. This is below the threshold for losing statistical significance for the primary endpoint finding even if one assumes a primary efficacy event rate in subjects with errors that is 5x the observed event rate in the warfarin arm. Also note that the composite error rate in <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 7</ref> is quite similar in the 2 treatment arms, rather than the nearly impossible (and exceedingly unfavorable for the warfarin arm) asymmetrical pattern that the model assumes. Thus, the observed superiority of apixaban for the primary endpoint persists despite worst-case assumptions about the rate of errors and their distribution. Analogous data for the primary safety endpoint, ISTH major bleeding, are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 11</ref>. Dr. Bai calculated that a minimum of 86 fewer bleeds in the warfarin arm would negate superiority of apixaban. If we assume that all errors were substitution of active apixaban for placebo apixaban in warfarin arm subjects, resulting in a subject taking two active drugs for 100 days, then a per subject error rate appreciably greater than 40% would be required for 86 additional bleeds in warfarin arm subjects if the bleeding rate during the error period was 3 x the observed overall major bleeding rate of 3.1%/year. If we assume a bleeding rate 5 x the observed overall rate during the error period, then an error rate appreciably greater than 20% would be required to negate superiority of apixaban. However, the worst case error rate was less than 13%, and the actual error probably substantially less than that. Note that errors in warfarin/placebo dosing were considerably more common than errors in apixaban/placebo, and this model assumes that all errors involved apixaban dosing in the warfarin arm, which clearly was not the case. Thus, the observed superiority of apixaban for ISTH major bleeding also persists despite worst-case modeling assumptions.</p><p>The finding of superiority for mortality in ARISTOTLE is more fragile than either the primary efficacy or safety endpoint findings. A swing of one death in the wrong direction would result in a p-value greater than 0.05 for the difference in mortality rates. However, given that extensive analyses show roughly similar error rates in the two Page 23 treatment arms, and the observed rates of stroke and death due to stroke 4 are substantially reduced in the apixaban arm, it seems speculative and illogical to infer an effect on death that disfavors apixaban in an analysis adjusted for medication errors. For a more thorough discussion of this issue, see the discussion of mortality in Sec. 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Request 2</head><p>This request concerned additional cases of unblinding discovered in connection with the bottle label analyses conducted by the sponsor. As noted in the initial review, the bottle label tear off panel had a scratch-off coating that covered information on the identity of the study drug within the bottle. Investigators were supposed to report all cases in which they scratched off this coating.</p><p>The sponsor examined all collected labels in the Convenience, First Random and Confirmatory Random Samples. There were no unreported unblindings in the Convenience and First Random Samples. In the Confirmatory Random Sample, there were 4 labels from 3 subjects (each at a different site) discovered to have been scratched off, breaking the blind for the relevant subject, that were not known to BMS prior to examining the labels. This amounts to 3 out of 6511 subjects in the Combined Random Sample, or 0.046%, with previously undocumented unblinding. At this rate, one would expect a total of about 8.4 such unblindings in subjects in the entire study population of 19,140 treated subjects, which is not of concern. For more information about the subjects with previously unreported unblinding in the Confirmatory Random Sample, see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 12</ref>. Reviewer comment: One might be concerned about missing labels with regard to unreported unblinding, because it is possible that an unreported, scratched off label would be more likely to be not submitted to BMS by a site involved in one of the two random samples than some other label. Overall, in the Combined Random Sample, there were 927 labels that were missing in the sense of being absent (435 and 492 in the apixaban and warfarin arms, respectively, see <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 3</ref>). However, only 2 of these absent labels were at sites where there were unreported unblindings in the Combined Random Sample (one at each of 2 sites, 0838 and 0956). This is somewhat, but not Page 24 completely reassuring. However, the hypothesis of informative missingness suggested in the first sentence of this comment is speculative.</p></div>

However, ARISTOTLE had a reduced source data verification (RSDV) plan, which was first described in Ver. 4.0 of the SMP (Jan 29, 2007). Under this plan, once a site met specified data quality criteria, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">5</ref> 1 out of 2 subjects at the site would have 100% source data verification (SDV).

We were concerned that important datasets used for the primary and secondary analyses may also be inaccurate. The FDA-identified errors and the Applicant's investigation of these errors are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 13</ref>. The Applicant explained that the analysis datasets and programmed statistical outputs (primarily developed by PPD) were double programmed by independent statisticians or programmers.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Request 6</head><p>This request was for a dataset that indicates the correct designation of the adverse event as either serious or non-serious (NSAE). Unique adverse events that appeared multiple times in the AE dataset (as both an SAE and NSAE) were collapsed into one record if the records contained the same MedDRA Preferred Term (PT) and the same onset date. In addition, if information regarding the study drug differed between the 2+ records that were collapsed, then the most conservative value was kept (e.g., The most conservative value for "Relationship to study drug" is "most related". The most Page 29 conservative value for "Action taken regarding study drug" is "drug discontinued, followed by drug interrupted, followed by dose change").</p><p>The revised dataset, ADAE2.xpt, appeared to correctly designate unique AEs as either serious or NSAE, however the dataset still contained multiple NSAE records for a unique event. (e.g., two NSAE records for one subject are identical except that the drug was discontinued in one record and no action was taken with the drug for the other record). The effect of this would have an impact if the NSAE records were mapped to different MedDRA terms.</p><p>Reanalysis of the SAE data with the revised dataset did not alter the SAE results, as suspected. As mentioned in Section 7.3.2.2 (Other Nonfatal SAEs) of our review, there were more SAEs for syncope and related terms in subjects on apixaban compared to warfarin. The reviewer cannot offer an explanation for this finding, but the treatment difference and concern of falls in this population warrants inclusion of syncope in labeling. The analysis of adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation with the revised dataset was similar to that reported in our original review. The reasons for treatment discontinuation were similar between treatment groups. The most common High Level Group Term (HLGT) for nonfatal AE leading to treatment discontinuation was central nervous system vascular disorders followed by gastrointestinal hemorrhages, and then epidermal and dermal conditions.</p><p>Significant nonfatal AEs that led to dose interventions are shown for HLGT. Based on the ARISTOTLE protocol, it is expected that warfarin treated subjects would have more dose changes. Non-serious AEs that were severe or greater in intensity occurred in ~ 8% of subjects and were generally similar in both treatment arms.  Common AE with the revised dataset produced results identical to that of the Applicant's, and the results were discussed in Section 7.4.1 of the original review.</p><p>These data provide no evidence of a signal of a difference in non-bleeding AEs between warfarin and apixaban.</p><p>Page 31</p></div>

ARISTOTLE -Bleeding Rates with Concomitant Aspirin Use</head><p>In ARISTOTLE, 27% of subjects on apixaban also took NSAIDS (mostly acetaminophen) for some duration during the trial.

Although warfarin has reversal agents, it is unclear if their use has had a significant impact on important outcomes.

If useful information can be gleaned from that information, an addendum will be written.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mortality in ARISTOTLE</head><p>As noted above, the information on medication errors does not negate the observed findings of superiority to warfarin for the primary efficacy endpoint, time to the composite of stroke and systemic embolism, and the primary safety endpoint, time to ISTH major bleeding.</p><p>The mortality finding (superiority for all-cause death) is not nearly as robust as the findings for the primary endpoint and major bleeding. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 19</ref> is adapted from the original clinical review of the NDA. Note that the HR for all-cause death favors apixaban with a point estimate of 0.89, but the upper limit of the 95% CI for all-cause death is 1.00 and the p is 0.465. Dr. Bai calculated that 1 less death in the warfarin arm would negate statistical significance for superiority of apixaban. While one could imagine that medication errors might have contributed to one or more deaths in the warfarin arm, such errors might also have contributed to deaths in the apixaban arm.</p><p>It is noteworthy that in addition to being superior to warfarin for the primary endpoint of time to stroke or systemic embolism, apixaban was superior to warfarin for time to stroke of any kind (199 vs. 250 events, HR =0.79, 95% CI 0.66, 0.95) and fatal stroke (38 vs. 65, HR=0.58. 95% CI 0.39, 0.86), and nearly so for non-fatal stroke (161 vs. 185, HR=0.84, 95% CI 0.68, 1.04). The low HR for fatal stroke seem consistent with the advantage of apixaban over warfarin in terms of hemorrhagic strokes (40 vs. 78), which tend to be more severe and more often fatal than non-hemorrhagic strokes. It is quite plausible that an agent that is superior to another in reducing the rate of stroke, and in particular, fatal stroke, would have an advantage in terms of overall mortality, as long as it was at least neutral in terms of other important causes of death, which apixaban seems to be.</p><p>Thus, data from ARISTOTLE for fatal outcomes other than all-cause death and for serious non-fatal outcomes lend credibility to the observed finding of superiority of apixaban over warfarin for all-cause death. In addition, the strong trend for a mortality advantage for apixaban over aspirin in AVERROES, which was terminated after an interim analysis showed superiority for the primary endpoint of time to stroke or SE, also lends support to the mortality finding in ARISTOTLE. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Note that while aspirin is not approved to reduce either the rate of stroke or mortality in subjects with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, a meta-analysis of study data suggests that it does reduce the rate of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> It thus seems likely that the rate of death in aspirin-treated subjects with atrial fibrillation is not increased over no treatment, and that superiority of apixaban over aspirin for all-cause death would support an effect of apixaban on mortality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Page 35</head><p>In RE-LY, the data for the comparison of dabigatran 150 mg bid vs. warfarin yielded a HR for mortality of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.77, 1.00). A hazard ratio for fatal stroke is not available, but the risk ratio for dabigatran 150 mg vs. warfarin was 0.52. Thus the apixaban mortality data are quite similar to those of dabigatran, a closely related product for the same indication <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 20)</ref>.</p><p>In sum, apixaban and dabigatran are closely related drugs that inhibit adjacent steps near the end of the coagulation cascade. Both drugs are superior to warfarin in terms of reducing the rates of stroke and systemic embolism, and show similar reductions in the rate of all-cause death and fatal stroke compared to warfarin.</p><p>It is also notable that in ARISTOTLE, while fatal strokes make up only 8% of total deaths (103/1272) the difference between the treatment arms in fatal strokes, 27, is 41% of the difference between the two arms in total deaths (66). In RE-LY, fatal strokes made up 7% of total deaths, while the difference between the treatment arms in fatal strokes, 21, was 43% of the difference between the arms in deaths (49). Thus, in each study, fatal strokes made up less than 10% of overall deaths, but the difference between the treatment arms in fatal strokes made up over 40% of the overall difference between the arms in deaths. Thus, the difference in mortality between the arms was due in substantial part to a reduction in the rate of fatal stroke, which is a not surprising finding for drugs that reduce the rate of stroke. Note that both apixaban and dabigatran were associated with large reductions in the rate of hemorrhagic stroke, which tends to be more serious and more often fatal than ischemic stroke. This too would also be consistent with an effect on overall mortality <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 20)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">8</ref> Thus, the similarities in the mortality data in ARISTOTLE and RE-LY, and the close proximity of Factor Xa and IIa in the coagulation cascade, suggest that the two studies could be considered to support each other's findings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">9</ref> There is precedent for this practice. Losartan and irbesartan were both studied (in separate placebo-controlled trials) for use in prevention of progression of diabetic nephropathy based on a composite that included changes in serum creatinine. Each product was directly supported by one trial, but two trials would ordinarily be required to support an approval based on a surrogate. However, the studies and the drugs were similar enough so that the studies could be considered to support each other, and both drugs were approved for the diabetic nephropathy indication. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> In that case, the drugs were in the same class (angiotensin receptor blockers) and the sponsors gave each other a right of reference to the relevant data. These conditions are not applicable here. However, the mortality data in ARISTOTLE and RE-LY are very similar, and the drugs are closely related, as both are inhibitors of clotting factors in the final common pathway of the coagulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">8</ref> Dabigatran, unlike apixaban, also significantly reduced the rate of ischemic stroke compared to warfarin.</p><p>To date, dabigatran is the only novel anticoagulant to have shown this benefit in subjects with AF. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">9</ref> ROCKET-AF, a blinded trial comparing rivaroxaban to warfarin in subjects with AF, had a directionally similar pattern of efficacy findings, but rivaroxaban was not superior to warfarin in the ITT population for the primary endpoint or for mortality. 10 See NDA 20-757, Review by E.

The purpose of this addendum is to address information relating to medication errors submitted by the sponsor late in the review cycle that was not addressed in our final review: the applicant's programmed edit checks, the applicant's method of producing the container label dataset, the potential impact on endpoint events. The addendum also adds to the discussion of data integrity, an issue that was described in our review.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Programmed edit checks</head><p>While we refer to the applicant's less than diligent monitoring at the sites, we did not fully explain the rationale for our comment. This addendum provides our thoughts on the applicant's programmed validation checks (submission 48) that ran in the background of the eCRF; these edit checks ran after values were entered into the eCRF and saved in the database. Discrepant fields were highlighted in red for Site personnel to review.</p><p>There were ten programmed edit checks used for study medication. 1 Four (#2, 3, 4, and 5) of these checked that the container number dispensed or verified/returned were within the allowable range of container numbers (100001-875128). The problem with these checks is that the container number entered in these fields was not checked against the number assigned by the IVRS. Of the edit check discrepancy messages found in the CRFs, the most common one was for edit check #7 which compared the apixaban/placebo container number verified at a visit with the apixaban/placebo container number dispensed at the previous visit. The problem with check #7 is that the apixaban/placebo bottle was not always dispensed at the previous visit, yet this edit check message appeared. So while this discrepancy message appears many times for a subject, it was often meaningless. Check #9 compares the container number dispensed at a visit to all the container numbers dispensed at any subsequent visit to catch duplication. While this check was at the subject level only, had it also been done for the entire system it would have caught transcription errors. The reviewer did not find many examples of discrepancy text for edit checks #1, 6, 8, 10 2 ; however three of these four only applied to apixaban/placebo. Thus, edit checks for apixaban/placebo were more rigorous than for warfarin/placebo. This may explain why the rate of discrepancy between the verified/return fields and IVRS database was considerably higher for warfarin/placebo than for apixaban/placebo. However, it does not prove that the correct bottle was actually dispensed in the case of such discrepancies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Container label dataset</head><p>The applicant defined illegible label in an email communication to Dr. Grant on June 19, 2012. We disagree with their definition and believe that an illegible label should be a label that cannot be read (i.e., the container number is torn off the label, or the label is sufficiently smudged and cannot be read). Moreover, during FDA inspection of the labels at BMS, Ms. Blaus and Dr. Rose were able to read labels that the applicant deemed illegible. Labels that are difficult to read are more prone to errors; the applicant should consider all illegible labels a medication error. We note each bottle label tear-off panel also has a bar code; we were informed by the sponsor that this is a unique bar code. It might be possible use these bar codes to ascertain the bottle number when the numbers on the label are not legible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Observed effects of medication errors on elinical events</head><p>The sponsor did several analyses of clinical events that occurred during periods that a patient took medication from an erroneously administered medication bottle of the wrong type; i.e., one that contained the wrong study medication (not including dispensing of the wrong dose of apixaban). In an analysis provided in the Sponsor's "White Paper" on medication errors that included events occurring while taking tablets from an error bottle and for 90 additional days afterwards, there were 4 primary efficacy or safety outcomes:</p><p>â€¢ One patient in the apixaban arm had a non-fatal ischemic stroke during a 9 day period of dual placebo therapy. â€¢ One patient in the apixaban arm experienced a non-fatal major bleed during a 90day period of dual active therapy, â€¢ One patient in the apixaban arm had a non-fatal major bleed within 90 days of a period of dual placebo therapy, and â€¢ One patient in the warfarin arm experienced a nonfatal major bleed within 90 days of a 31 day period of dual active therapy.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: the Sponsor did not specify how errors were detected and or how many errors occurred. We were orally informed that these errors were found by comparing the eCRF dispensing field with the IVRS data.</p><p>The third of these events, a major bleed during dual placebo therapy, is an unexpected finding. The other 3 events are consistent with expectations: patients taking two placebos would have in increased risk of ischemic stroke, while those taking two actives would have an increased risk of bleeding. In any event this small number of events is not informative. However, as explained in the main review, we are concerned that some errors in dispensing may not have been recognized because the site entered the IVRS assigned bottle number into the eCRF dispensing field instead of the bottle that was really dispensed to the patient. We think the bottle labels are a more accurate record of dispensing.</p><p>The sponsor did an analogous analysis in patient with errors identified by using the dispensing, verified, and returned fields. This produced a much larger number of errors.</p><p>Tables provided below show rates of stroke/systemic embolism and death during the time the patient took tablets from the error bottle and for 90 days afterwards:     Reviewer Comment: Tables with differing lengths of follow-up after the patient stopped taking medication from the error bottle were provided to us (0, 30, 60 and 90 days), but we are presenting the 90 day data here; it generally has the highest event rates and permits capture of events during the period that warfarin control is reestablished after an interruption. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> includes patients who received any study medication bottle of the wrong type, i.e., one that contained a drug other the one they were supposed to receive, except that substitution of one dose of active apixaban for another was not counted as an error. Patients represented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> all received a placebo bottle in place of an active bottle. Thus, unless they experienced two errors at the same time, they took two placebos for some period of time instead of one active and one placebo, and would have been at higher risk of ischemic stroke. The patients represented in Table3 all received an active in place of placebo. Unless they experienced two errors at the same time, they would have taken two actives for some period of time, and would have been at increased risk of bleeding.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data integrity</head><p>This addendum cites another mismatch issue identified with the datasets and CRF. The data for one subject, ID 185030-0252-20280, shows that the subject continued treatment until the end of the study (Month 13), while the eCRF does not have data (including medication and disposition data) past Month 4. This error was identified rather easily in a dataset that contains over 1,000,000 lines of observations. One possibility is that the applicant left important pages off of the eCRF, but another possibility is that the data do not match the eCRF, an issue that was cited in the main review for an identified valid date.</p></div>

Sensitivity analyses that remove all subjects who may have been dispensed incorrect study drug do not undermine the conclusion that the benefit of apixaban in ARISTOTLE is greater than the risk and that apixaban was noninferior to warfarin in reducing the risk of stroke with significantly less bleeding.

Although site monitoring did detect some instances of subjects receiving bottles of study drugs different from those assigned, errors in dispensing study drug continued during the conduct of the trial with no action taken to lessen their frequency.

A detailed analysis of the results and the significance of ARISTOTLE and AVERROES will not be included in this memo because the applicant will be asked to supply more reliable data about which study drug subjects actually received as well as about the monitoring of ARISOTLE.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation</head><p>A stroke is a sudden neurological deficit of vascular origin lasting more than 24 hours or associated with infarction on brain imaging. Stroke remains a major source of morbidity and mortality in the USA. Each year about 795,000 Americans have a stroke, of who about 135,000 die, making stroke the third leading cause of death in the USA (AHA Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics-2012 Update). About 15% of all strokes are attributable to AF. The prevalence of AF is strongly associated with age; the prevalence in the general population is about 1% but in those over 80 the prevalence approaches 10%. In those over 80 years AF is the single leading cause of major stroke.</p><p>Atrial fibrillation results in uncoordinated atrial contraction with resulting stasis of blood, especially in the left atrial appendage. Stasis predisposes to thrombus formation; embolization of thrombus from the left atrial appendage into the cerebral circulation results in stroke. Strokes in patients with AF are often large and disabling.</p><p>The baseline risk of stroke in patients with AF can vary widely depending on the presence or absence of various concomitant conditions. In the absence of any of these conditions ('lone atrial fibrillation'), the risk is about 1% per year. Hence anticoagulants are generally prescribed only to patients with AF whose baseline risk for stroke is high enough to offset the risk of bleeding (major bleeding rate of about 2% per year). The risk for stroke in patients with AF is commonly estimated using the CHADS 2 (CHF, Hypertension, Age, Diabetes, Stroke or TIA) stroke risk classification. In this classification scheme, the presence of CHF, hypertension, age â‰¥ 75, and diabetes are assigned a score of one and a history of stroke or TIA are assigned a score of two. The score is the sum of all component scores. Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, has been marketed for reduction of the risk of stroke in patients with AF for many years. The results of placebo-controlled trials of administering warfarin to patients with atrial fibrillation indicate that warfarin markedly reduces the relative risk of stroke, by about 2/3. Although very effective in reducing the risk of stroke, warfarin is difficult and burdensome to administer well. Its pharmacological action can be affected by a number of drug-drug, drug-disease, and food-drug interactions. As a result, its pharmacodynamic effect (measured as international normalized ratio or INR) is typically monitored at least monthly so that the dose can be adjusted if needed. Because of the difficulty in dosing warfarin and because it is an anticoagulant, major bleeding is common (2% per year) in patients with AF taking warfarin. Warfarin-related toxicity causes more than 43,000 emergency room visits each year making it the second most common drug (after insulin) implicated in emergency room visits in the United States.</p><p>In the last two years, two single anticoagulation factor inhibitors have been approved for marketing in the USA for reduction of the risk of stroke in patients with AF. Dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, was approved in October 2010 "to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation." The current PI indicates that a dose of 150 mg bid is superior to warfarin with a two-sided p-value = 0.0001 and a HR of 0.65 with significant reduction in the risk of ischemic as well as hemorrhagic stroke and with a similar rate of major bleeding. Rivaroxaban, a factor Xa inhibitor (like apixaban), was approved in November 2011 "to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation." The current PI indicates that a dose of 20 mg qPM is noninferior but not superior to warfarin with a similar rate of major bleeding.</p><p>Although not included in the indication section of the PI for aspirin (21 CFR 343.80), the 2011 ACCF/AHA/HRS Focused Updates Incorporated into ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Atrial Fibrillation states "aspirin, 81 -325 mg, is recommended as an alternative to vitamin K antagonistsâ€¦in those with contraindications to oral anticoagulation." Meta-analyses have indicated that aspirin reduces the relative risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation by about 20-25% per year; i.e., it is much less effective than warfarin for this indication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">CMC</head><p>The CMC reviewers concluded that the applicant's proposed manufacturing (and associated analytic methods) of the drug product and drug substance are acceptable. Manufacturing site inspections were acceptable. Stability testing supports an initial expiry of 36 months. There are no remaining outstanding CMC issues.</p><p>The doses administered in most nonclinical studies submitted to support the NDA were limited by bleeding due to the anticoagulant activity of apixaban. Nonetheless, standard repeat dose toxicology studies and safety pharmacology studies indicated that the safety margins for all toxicities except bleeding were acceptable. Humans have a significantly higher concentration of one metabolite (O-desmethyl apixaban sulfate) than in the usual nonclical species. Nonetheless, the total exposure in the dogs was high enough to conclude that this human metabolite is toxicologically qualified. Apixaban appears to be retained within the eye for a prolonged period after discontinuation of dosing but is not phototoxic in vitro.</p><p>There were two notable findings in the nonclinical studies:</p><p>1) Up to 12% of the maternal dose of apixaban is excreted in milk, posing a risk to nursing babies of unintended anticoagulation with the attendant risk of bleeding. This risk will be disclosed in the PI.</p><p>2) Juvenile studies indicate that apixaban may cause degeneration of the developing testicular seminiferous tubules. This finding appears reversible. This finding will need to be further explored prior to the conduct of any pediatric studies.</p><p>Apixaban did not demonstrate genotoxic potential in the Ames Assay, in vivo chromosome aberration assay (Chinese hamster ovary cells), or rat micronucleus assay.</p></div>

It may be that a lower dose of apixaban would result in a similar reduction of the risk of CNS and non-CNS embolism with less risk of bleeding. Of course it should be noted that relative to warfarin, apixaban appears to have reduced the risk of bleeding.</p><p>In ARISTOTLE subjects with two or more of three factors (age â‰¥ 80 years, weight â‰¤ 60 kg, and serum creatinine â‰¥ 1.5 mg/dl) were administered a dose of 2.5 mg bid. This dose adjustment was made to minimize bleeding risk and was not based on PK considerations. Average exposure in the subjects administered 2.5 mg bid was about 25% less than those administered 5 mg bid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Drug-drug interactions</head><p>About 20% of apixaban dose is metabolized by CYP3A4. Exposure about doubles when coadministered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor so the dose administered clinically should be halved if administration with a strong inhibitor such as ketoconazole is required. Conversely, exposure is halved when co-administered with a strong CYP3A4 inducer so they should be avoided.</p></div>

Intrinsic factors potentially affecting elimination: age, gender, hepatic insufficiency and renal impairment.</head><p>Age, body weight, and gender as single factors have minimal impact on exposure.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Design and General Conduct of ARISTOTLE</head><p>ARISTOTLE was randomized, double-blind, double-dummy active-controlled non-inferiority study comparing administration of apixaban to warfarin in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and at least one additional of the CHADS 2 risk factors for stroke. The primary endpoint was time to the first occurrence of stroke or non-CNS systemic embolism. The trial was initiated in December 2006 and the last subject visit occurred in May 2011. The final clinical study report indicates that 18,201 subjects recruited at over 1000 sites in 40 countries were randomized 1:1 to either apixaban (generally at a dose of 5 mg po bid) or investigator titrated warfarin. 477 endpoint events were analyzed in the primary endpoint analysis.</p><p>"The difference in the proportion of subjects with relevant or significant deviations is driven by error in treatment assignment where 7.3% of subjects in the apixaban group and 1.2% of subjects in the warfarin group received, at some point during the study, a container of the wrong type."</p><p>So the clinical study report states that apixaban subjects were six times more likely to be dispensed an incorrect study drug than were warfarin subjects and that a rather large number of all subjects were dispensed a study drug to which they were not randomized at some point during their participation in ARISTOTLE. While the discrepancy and rate of error in dispensing study medication apparently did not occasion any serious inquiry by the applicant prior to submission of the NDA, it was noticed by the clinical and statistical reviewers of this NDA. Inquiries from the Agency resulted in the applicant providing information that could be characterized as evolving over time but also could be characterized as contradictory.</p><p>These dispensing errors were the result of the complicated procedures employed by the applicant for dispensing study drug, which provided many avenues for human error (both in dispensing and recording what was dispensed). As should have been anticipated, everywhere human error could have occurred it did occur (cf. Murphy's Law). The following are the steps that had to be completed related to dispensing of study drug: 1. The investigator or his/her designee had to enter the correct identifying information for the subject in the interactive voice response system (IVRS). 2. They had to remember or record the IVRS assigned serial number of the bottle to be dispensed. 3. They had to either choose the correct bottle from wherever study drug was being stored (which varied from site to site) or depend on someone else to have the correct information to do so. 4. They had to tear off a label from the bottle and place it in the correct subject's paper CRF 800 (at least during the first half of the study. For reasons apparently not contemporaneously documented in any trial related document, the bottle stickers in the second half of the trial were to be retained but not necessarily on a paper CRF and were no longer intended to be collected by the applicant at the end of the study). 5. They had to give the bottle to the correct subject. 6. They had to enter the correct serial number on the eCRF (which might happen at a time remote from dispensing; initially the system used for recording information on the eCRF frequently was not available). 7. They subsequently had to enter the correct bottle serial number on the eCRF each time the subject came in for a visit. 8. They had to enter the correct bottle serial number on the eCRF when (and if) the subject returned the bottle. In addition, there were two logs at each investigative site supplied by the sponsor/applicant: 1) an inventory log in which the serial number of each bottle shipped to the site and each bottle dispensed was recorded and 2) a log for each subject in which the serial number of each bottle dispensed to that particular subject was recorded.</p><p>Each subject was dispensed bottles of apixaban or apixaban placebo and separate bottles of warfarin or warfarin placebo. Each of the two study drugs were dispensed independently and therefore when a dispensing error resulted in an incorrect study drug being dispensed, usually only one of the two study drugs was dispensed incorrectly resulting in a subject being administered two active study drugs or two placebos until the next time study drug was dispensed. The dispensing of two placebo study drugs results in a subject not being treated with any anticoagulant putting them at unnecessary risk for stroke. The dispensing of two active study drugs exposes a subject to unnecessary risk of bleeding.</p><p>The applicant had four sources of data available for determining which study drugs were dispensed to each subject: 1. The serial numbers entered in the eCRFs. 2. The serial numbers recorded by the IVRS. 3. The labels torn from the bottles and retained after being dispensed. 4. Two drug accountability logs. The applicant apparently used only the first source to come to the conclusion stated on page 88 of clinical study report of ARISTOTLE. And that conclusion reflected only subjects who appeared to receive active study drug instead of placebo (e.g., if assigned to apixaban but received active warfarin instead of the placebo for warfarin). In response to FDA requests the applicant examined the second source and finally, from the third source, an 8% sample of tear off labels (mostly from Russian sites) BMS had in-house (despite the decision in 2009 not to collect the paper CRFs to which the bottle stickers had been affixed). During this process the applicant disclosed to FDA that manual changes had been made to the IVRS system to change the serial number of the bottle assigned. According to the applicant these changes were made in response to information provided by investigators directly to the IVRS vendor, to ensure that a bottle dispensed in error would be removed from inventory so it could not be assigned. It should be noted here that manual changes to an IVRS should be made only under very limited circumstances and must always have a full audit trail indicating who, why, and when the changes were made.</p><p>In response to a request from EMA, the applicant eventually collected an additional 12% of tear off labels from sites selected at random in order to clarify the extent of errors in dispensing study drug. The summary report of the findings (but not the full report) was only recently submitted to FDA. This report appears to represent the current thinking of the applicant on this issue. The applicant asserts in this report that the actual number of bottles dispensed that contained an incorrect medication (not counting incorrect doses of apixaban) was likely 0.03% and the number of subjects who received an incorrect study drug at some time during the study was 0.65 % (and because there was 50% chance that a bottle dispensed with an incorrect serial number contained the incorrect study medication, it follows that 1.3% of subjects received a bottle with an incorrect serial number at some point during the study.) The summary report raises a number of issues, among them:</p><p>ï‚· A random sample of 12% may plausibly characterize the bottle error rate but it is not clear how the sample size was determined.</p><p>ï‚· The appropriateness of including the convenience sample 8% already collected is not satisfactorily explained.</p><p>ï‚· The analyses the applicant performed utilized legible labels; it is unclear how many illegible labels there were and how these missing data may have affected the conclusions. Intuitively, it seems that a bottle with a difficult to read label is more likely to be dispensed in error.</p><p>ï‚· The sponsor asserts that most of the apparent errors were actually due to incorrect recording in the eCRF of the serial number of the bottle dispensed. The errors were found mostly in the fields of the eCRF in which the serial numbers of the bottles returned were recorded. The applicant states this field was not subjected to as rigorous an edit check as the field in the eCRF in which serial numbers of dispensed bottles were recorded. The applicant does not provide an explanation of why transcription errors were so frequent at the time when the investigative site actually had the bottle and so could consult it to determine the serial number.</p><p>It should be noted again that the submission of even the summary report came toward the end of the the 3 month extension of the initial PDUFA goal date, far too late to be fully reviewed before the final PDUFA goal date.</p><p>The information provided to the Agency is not all the information available for determining the actual number of dispensing errors and the number of subjects who actually received an incorrect bottle of study drug (i.e., a bottle with the serial number other than the one assigned via the IVRS). As noted above, other sources for determining when and to whom study bottles were dispensed remains unexamined, most importantly the 80% of bottle tear-off labels that remain at investigative sites. Depending on assumptions made, more than 10% of subjects may have received at least one bottle of study drug different from the one assigned by the IVRS. And the number of bottles dispensed that contained incorrect study medication (regardless of whether the serial number on the bottle was the one actually assigned) may be much less than 0.1%.</p><p>With the currently available information the following can be confidently concluded: ï‚· The percentage of subjects who either were dispensed a bottle with an incorrect serial number or who had at least one error on a CRF related to study drug dispensed is in excess of 10%. ï‚· The number of bottles dispensed that contained incorrect study drug (defined as receiving a study drug of the wrong type or the wrong dose of study drug) is much less than 1.0%. ï‚· Using any reasonable assumptions, the number of bottles dispensed that contained incorrect study drug is not large enough to overturn the finding that apixaban was noninferior to warfarin in ARISTOTLE. ï‚· No conclusive evidence of harm to a subject as a result of an error in dispensing study drug has been found.</p><p>Regarding the last point, however, the failure to identify the problems with dispensing study drugs during the trial could have increased subjects' risks of stroke and bleeding. FDA could refuse to review a study submitted in support of an NDA if the safety of the subjects in the study was not adequately protected. So we need a clearer picture of exactly how dosing was monitored.</p><p>The reviewers identify an additional issue related to the errors in dispensing study drugs: why they were not detected during the course of the trial and corrected. The monitoring performed by the applicant did identify many subjects in whom entries in the CRFs and IVRS were discrepant and so may have been dispensed a wrong bottle of study drug (the trial was blinded so study monitors should not have known if a study bottle dispensed with an incorrect serial number contained the assigned study drug). And there are instances of subjects being notified they had received incorrect bottles and returning them to the site. Nonetheless the applicant does not seem to have been aware during the conduct of ARISTOTLE that many subjects were dispensed an incorrect bottle of study drug. And the applicant has not provided any evidence that they took action to remedy the complicated procedures utilized to dispense study drug, which were the probable source of the errors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Advisory Committee Meeting</head><p>This application was not the subject for an advisory committee (AC). Two other oral anticoagulants (dabigatran and rivaroxaban) have been approved for marketing for stroke prevention in patients with AF and so the issues presented by this NDA did not seem particularly novel or controversial at the time of filing. Trial conduct issues were identified late in the review cycle (the application was a priority review). The possibility of an advisory committee was then re-considered but it was concluded that the issues raised could not be usefully addressed by an AC with the information currently available.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OSI Inspections/ Fraud in China</head><p>On 30 December BMS notified the Agency of GCP misconduct by one of its employees at site 1200 in Shanghai China. The original PDUFA goal date of 28 March 2012 was extended by three months to allow for adequate time for OSI to complete its assessment of this event.</p><p>Although BMS contracted with a Contract Research Organization, PPD, to provide site monitoring for ARISTOTLE, PPD did not have a presence in the People's Republic of China when the trial was initiated in PRC; BMS initially used its own employees for monitoring. One BMS employee along with at least one other individual altered subject records after being notified the site would be inspected by OSI. OSI inspected eight clinical sites worldwide after becoming aware of this action. Additionally, after errors in dispensing study drug became an issue, BMS and PPD, a CRO involved in conducting and monitoring ARISTOTLE, were inspected specifically to review the issue of trial oversight and monitoring. OSI concludes that the study appears to have been conducted and monitored adequately. They did recommend that data from sites in China be excluded because the employee who committed the GCP violation in China was involved in the conduct of the trial at all Chinese sites.</p><p>Two observations in the OSI Clinical Inspection Summary dated 11 May 2012 are of note: ï‚· Two instances were found of investigators unblinding subjects for reasons other than medical emergency. Investigators could unblind subjects by scratching off the stickers in their possession, i.e., without notifying the applicant. Because the applicant did not collect most of the stickers torn off the study drug bottles, it is unclear if all, or even most, instances of unblinding are known. ï‚· One investigator in India knowingly maintained subjects' INRs in a range below that specified in the protocol. Apparently this practice was not identified and corrected by monitoring.</p></div>

The Agency has not discussed other portions of the label with the applicant.</p><p>If the NDA were to be approved at this time, then the Division's recommendation would be to indicate in the label that administration of apixaban reduces the risk of stroke at an acceptable rate of bleeding without including any discussion of specific trial results and p-values. The uncertainty that remains about which study drug some subjects were actually taking precludes reaching a conclusion with sufficient precision to state in the label.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommended Regulatory Action</head><p>The drug dispensing errors do not appear at this time frequent enough to undermine a finding that apixaban is safe and effective for reducing the risk of stroke and non-CNS systemic emboli in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Nonetheless, it is a matter of concern that the actual study drugs given to subjects remain uncertain because the best source for this information, the study drug bottle tear off labels, have not been fully examined. If the Agency had been aware of the statement on page 88 of the clinical study report for ARISTOTLE prior to filing the application, we would have refused to file it; MAPP 6010.5 indicates that "substantive deficiencies â€¦ that appear to have been inadequately addressed in the applicationâ€¦" are a basis for refusal to file. And among the reasons to refuse to approve an NDA listed in 21CFR 314.125 is the lack of "explanation of the omission of other informationâ€¦pertinent to the application."</p><p>The decision to be made then is a difficult and subjective one, balancing the utility of making apixaban available now and the undesirability of approving an NDA when there remains uncertainty as to what study drug subjects were given, an uncertainty that has not yet been adequately addressed. And there is hardly anything more fundamental to understanding the outcomes of a trial than knowledge of the study drugs actually administered. Clearly it would be unreasonable to require the applicant to try to determine with 100% accuracy what every subject in ARISTOTLE was taking at all times. But that is not the same as requesting the applicant to use all available sources for determining as well as possible which study drugs subjects were dispensed. It appears the applicant has collected a 12% random sample of the study drug bottle tear off labels for an EMA-requested analysis and that may be sufficient to place an acceptable upper bound on the rate of dispensing incorrect study drug.</p><p>Beyond these questions, the Division believes that there are two reasons the NDA should not be approved at this time:</p><p>1. Without more clarity about when subjects received either no active study drug or two active study drugs, it is not possible to query whether subjects suffered harm as a result of the applicant's inaction while ARISOTLE was being conducted.</p><p>2. The applicant has not yet provided the audit trail for the manual changes to the IVRS to demonstrate that all changes to the IVRS were appropriate.</p><p>Finally, the applicant does not appear to have provided the monitoring plan actually used during the conduct of ARISTOTLE. There was a preliminary monitoring plan at initiation of the trial. And the applicant submitted a final monitoring plan, but it is dated after data lock so it is not clear if it was the plan used while the trial was being conducted. The Agency should require submission of the monitoring plan actually used during the trial, i.e. documentation of all changes made to the initial monitoring plan during the trial for the following reasons:</p><p>ï‚· The sponsor's most favorable interpretation of the data indicates that more than 1% of subjects in the trial received a study drug bottle with a serial number other than the one assigned by the IVRS and site monitoring identified a number of these subjects. The failure to correct this problem could have led to errors in interpretation of the trial and could have exposed subjects to unnecessary harm. The Agency should review the plan to determine if it is likely that monitoring was inadequate in other important areas.</p><p>ï‚· The applicant has made many assertions about the frequency and kinds of edit checks that were made during the conduct of the trial. For example, the document responding to EMA's concerns about drug dispensing errors, the applicant states "programmed listings were also run to identify potential data errors, primarily in the dispensed fields of the eCRFâ€¦" Without the monitoring plan, the applicant's assertions can not be verified.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is a representation of an electronic record that was signed electronically and this page is the manifestation of the electronic signature.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Conclusions</head><p>The rate of discontinuation of follow-up for the primary efficacy endpoint in ARISTOTLE was similar in the apixaban 5 mg bid and warfarin treatment arms, 4.8%, at the time the primary endpoint was assessed. This endpoint, the time to the composite of stroke and systemic embolism, was assessed at the end of the Intended Treatment Period (ITP), which was the expected date of attainment of the study's event target. The rate of early discontinuation of follow-up was slightly higher than the analogous rates in the RE-LY trial (4.1% and 4.2% for the dabigatran 150 mg bid and warfarin arms, respectively), but it was considerably lower than the analogous rates in the ROCKET trial (7.4% and 7.0% for rivaroxaban 20 mg od and warfarin, respectively). Both dabigatran and rivaroxaban were approved for the same indication sought for apixaban on the basis of the studies cited above. This reviewer believes that the rate of early discontinuation of follow-up in ARISTOTLE is not in itself problematic in interpreting the results of the trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>ARISTOTLE is the primary support for the approval of apixaban for its proposed indication, the reduction in risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. It was a large (18,201 subjects), double-blind (double dummy), randomized, global, event driven trial comparing apixaban 5 mg bid (with a lower dose for patients with at least 2 of 3 pre-specified risk factors for bleeding) to warfarin titrated to a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0. The primary efficacy endpoint was noninferiority of apixaban to warfarin for time to the composite of stroke or systemic embolism. This endpoint was met. In an additional analysis that was allowed under the study's pre-specified hierarchical analysis plan, apixaban was also superior to warfarin.</p><p>A question has arisen regarding how the data for early discontinuation of follow-up in ARISTOTLE compare to analogous data from studies in NDAs submitted to FDA since 2009 for other drugs for the same indication as apixaban. These studies include the warfarin-controlled trials of dabigatran (RE-LY) and rivaroxaban (ROCKET). Like ARISTOTLE, these were large, global trials in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and had the same endpoint as apixaban.</p><p>Assessment of early discontinuation of follow-up may be complicated by the fact that some patients discontinue follow-up early (for example, for withdrawal of consent), but nonetheless may have known vital status at the end of a study, typically obtained from a database of deaths or a report from a family member. It is not rare for sponsors to consider these patients as not having discontinued follow-up early. However, while their vital status is known, the investigator may not know whether the patient has had an event such a stroke (which was part of the primary endpoint in all these studies). Thus, the better practice is usually to request discontinuation data that identifies these patients as having early discontinuation of follow-up.</p><p>Such data was requested from the Applicant. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> below is copied from the clinical review of the apixaban NDA, dated May 22, 2012. It contains discontinuation of followup data from ARISTOTLE that treats patients as lost to follow-up if they discontinue follow-up alive for the primary endpoint and other endpoints, without regard to knowledge of vital status at some time subsequent to the time that follow-up for other endpoints was discontinued. It indicates that 4.8% in each arm of ARISTOTLE had early discontinuation of follow-up. Similar data were requested and obtained for early discontinuation of follow-up in RE-LY and ROCKET. Summary data on early discontinuation of follow-up from ARISTOTLE and the two other studies are displayed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. RE-LY was a threearm trial, but data for only the approved dabigatran 150 mg bid dose and the warfarin comparator are shown; data for the dabigatran 110 mg bid dose (not approved in the US) are not shown. SPAF: Stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation n=Number of subjects who had not died before the discontinuation of follow-up and who withdrew consent for follow-up, were lost to follow-up, or had some other reason for early discontinuation of followup prior to the end of the ITP or an analogous study milestone.</p><p>In RE-LY, the early discontinuation rate was 4.1% and 4.2% in the dabigatran 150 mg bid and warfarin arms, respectively, slightly lower than in ARISTOTLE. However, in ROCKET, the early discontinuation rate was 7.4% and 7.0%, respectively, in the rivaroxaban 20 mg od and warfarin arms, substantially higher than in ARISTOTLE.</p><p>Dabigatran and rivaroxaban were approved on the basis of the RE-LY and ROCKET trials, respectively, and the rate of early discontinuation in neither trial was considered to be an impediment to approval. The rate of early discontinuation in ARISTOTLE is intermediate to the rates of early discontinuation in RE-LY and ROCKET, but it is substantially closer to the low rate of RE-LY than to ROCKET. This reviewer does not consider the early discontinuation rate in ARISTOTLE to be an impediment to approval.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is a representation of an electronic record that was signed electronically and this page is the manifestation of the electronic signature. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Recommendation on Regulatory Action</head><p>Based on our review of the clinical data, we recommend a complete response (CR). Reasons for this recommendation include:</p><p>1. This application rests entirely on the ARISTOTLE study as support for the efficacy of apixaban for its target indication, the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AFib). In addition, ARISTOTLE supplies most of the NDA's safety data. We do not have sufficient confidence in the ARISTOTLE study data to approve the application.</p><p>ARISTOTLE was a double dummy study in which subjects randomized to apixaban received active apixaban and placebo warfarin, and subjects randomized to warfarin received active warfarin and placebo apixaban. We discovered a substantial issue involving medication errors in ARISTOTLE, whereby subjects received either two active drugs or two placebos for varying amounts of time. The former would primarily increase the risk of bleeding, while the latter would primarily increase the risk of ischemic stroke and other thrombotic events. Some of the data indicate that the medication error rate, affecting up to about 8% of subjects in each arm, were driven by errors in the dispensing of warfarin/placebo (refers to active warfarin or placebo warfarin) bottles. If this is the case, one would expect that some warfarin arm subjects might receive placebo warfarin and placebo apixaban, and that some apixaban arm subjects might receive active apixaban and active warfarin. The potential consequence of these errors is a higher ischemic stroke rate in the warfarin arm, and a higher bleeding and or hemorrhagic stroke rate in the apixaban arm.</p><p>We are still not sure of the number and type of errors that occurred, despite considerable effort on the parts of the Applicant and the review team. Similarly, we are not sure of how these errors affected study outcomes.</p><p>The Applicant has told us that they were unaware of the scope of the medication errors during the trial or even when they submitted the NDA. This was due in part to deficiencies in centralized monitoring while data were accruing and less than diligent monitoring at the sites. Notably, there is no evidence that the sponsor initiated effective procedural changes to ameliorate the rate of medication errors, such as increasing the intensity of monitoring or the intensity of its centralized data checking procedures.</p><p>Both the Applicant and the review team have modeled the data to account in various ways for assumed medication errors. Even at assumed error rates that represent presumptive worst case scenarios, the observed findings of superiority 11 of apixaban to warfarin for the primary efficacy endpoint (time to stroke or systemic embolism) and for the primary safety endpoint of ISTH major bleeding a probably would not be overturned, however, the Applicant's laxity in conducting ARISTOTLE makes us uneasy about other aspects of the study that remain to be elucidated. There may be substantial problems about which the review team and the Applicant are not aware.</p><p>We do not expect trials to be conducted perfectly. However, the trial infrastructure should include processes and staffing to detect and understand problems that threaten the integrity of the trial. Trial management should then use this information to implement effective corrective measures to ensure trial integrity. It is notable that another Sponsor of a large global trial of a cardiovascular drug recently discovered a medication error problem during their trial and responded by substantially increasing the intensity of study monitoring and by changing drug dispensing procedures. This was not done during the ARISTOTLE trial.</p><p>Apixaban is proposed to treat a life-threatening condition for which warfarin and two newer oral agents are already approved. The Applicant should convince us of the rigor of its study processes and the integrity of the ARISTOTLE study data before we approve apixaban as the fourth orally available drug for this indication.</p><p>2. If we were inclined to approve apixaban at this time, it would be difficult to describe the results of ARISTOTLE in labeling due to the unknown rate of medication errors and their effects on the outcomes of the study. Notably, the Applicant has the ability to substantially ameliorate the current uncertainty about the rate of medication errors by collecting the bottle labels still outstanding. These bottle labels, which bear a unique code that identifies the medication, were to be torn from each bottle prior to dispensing and then affixed to a page of the paper case report form (CRF 800) for each subject. The Applicant initially planned to collect all CRF 800s at the end of the study. However, over half way through the trial the Applicant decided to not collect these labels at the end of the study, although investigators were instructed to continue to collect the labels and maintain them at the study sites. <ref type="bibr">b</ref> The Applicant informed us that they possess only 8% of the labels; the rest are presumably still at the study sites. In our view, these labels are the best available evidence of the medication dispensed to a subject.</p><p>The clinical reviewers believe that in the case of controlled trials that are the a ISTH =International Society on Thrombosis &amp; Hemostasis b The reason given to us (during interviews with BMS executives) for this change was that the project team determined that collecting the bottle labels was unnecessary because the IVRS system kept track of assigned bottles. The change in procedure was made in July 2009, and implemented through a series of emails to operations staff.

This is especially important when, as here, there is only one trial for the key comparison of safety and efficacy, or when the sponsor . Because we believe the bottle labels generally represent the best source of information regarding what drug was dispensed to any given subject, we believe that prior to approval, the Applicant should attempt to collect all of the outstanding bottle labels and thoroughly and accurately describe the medication error rate and its impact on important efficacy and safety parameters in ARISTOTLE. <ref type="bibr">c</ref> We believe that collecting a fraction of the labels will not suffice since knowing the treatments subjects received is fundamental to the interpretation of a trial, and that here the medication errors could confound both the evaluation of efficacy and safety. d Our concerns about the conduct of this study are sufficiently great such that we believe that (1) there is a lack of substantial evidence from adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations that apixaban has the effects its labeling purports it to have (21 CFR Sec. 314.125(b)(5)) and <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> there is insufficient information to determine whether the drug is safe for use as proposed in labeling (Sec. 314.125(b)(4)). In addition, we believe the proposed labeling is misleading in that it fails to describe and account for the problems in study conduct.

However, the true rate of medication errors is c We are not asking for perfect execution. The Applicant should make a diligent attempt to collect all the bottle labels. We expect that not all will be available for collection, and that some will be illegible. We also recognize that an individual bottle label in a patient's file may not accurately represent the medication actually received. However, in the aggregate, we think the bottle labels represent the best evidence of what was dispensed. d In a non-inferiority trial, poor study execution would ordinarily tend to reduce differences between treatments, making it easier to win. While the nominal results of this trial support superiority of apixaban to warfarin, the trial was planned as a non-inferiority trial at a time when it was not known whether any new anticoagulant would be superior to warfarin in efficacy.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Overview</head><p>The primary support for the proposed indication is the results of the warfarin-controlled ARISTOTLE trial. In addition, the Applicant conducted the aspirin-controlled AVERROES trial. Because warfarin has been convincingly demonstrated to be superior to antiplatelet agents (including aspirin alone or in combination with clopidogrel) in preventing thrombotic events in patients with nonvalvular AFib, and because aspirin is not indicated to prevent stroke in this population, the AVERROES trial should be considered merely supportive.</p><p>ARISTOTLE was a large (&gt;18,000 subjects), randomized, double blind (double dummy), event-driven, warfarin-controlled, non-inferiority trial in adults with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (AFl) with at least one additional risk factor for thrombotic events. The dose of apixaban was 5 mg by mouth (po) twice daily (2.5 mg twice daily for those with pre-specified risk factors for bleeding); warfarin was to be titrated to a target INR range of 2.0 to 3.0.</p><p>The primary endpoint was time to a composite of stroke and systemic embolism (SE). The Applicant's designated primary endpoint analysis was for non-inferiority (with a margin of 1.38 for the hazard ratio (HR)) in the ITT (all randomized patient) population. This analysis included events occurring during the "intended treatment period" (ITP), which extended from each patient's date of randomization to January 30, 2011, the estimated date of attainment of the study's target of 448 primary endpoint events. This analysis will be referred to as the "ITT/ITP" analysis. As the initial analysis in a 4-step hierarchical analysis plan, it was used to evaluate (1) non-inferiority to and then <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref> superiority to warfarin if non-inferiority was achieved. Steps 3 and 4 in the hierarchy are discussed below. The ITT/ITP analysis of the primary endpoint yielded a hazard ratio (apixaban vs. warfarin) of 0.79, with a 95% CI of 0.66 to 0.95, p (superiority) = 0.0114, thus supporting both non-inferiority and superiority. However, if the standard for a superiority claim based on a single study is a p â‰¤ 0.01, one could arguably deny a superiority claim. Additional analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint included ones of "evaluable" patients (i.e., the per-protocol population), counting events occurring during the ontreatment period (first dose of study drug to last dose + 2 days), and two other analyses based on the on-treatment period but with event windows extending to 7 or 30 days after the last dose of study drug. All these analyses of the primary endpoint results supported superiority of apixaban to warfarin, with p-values ranging from 0.011 in the worst case (the ITT/ITP analysis) to &lt; 0.001 in the best case (for both the on-treatment and last dose + 7 days analyses in the per-protocol population). Additional analyses of the primary endpoint in all treated patients using various event windows were all supportive of non-inferiority to warfarin, but not all supported superiority.</p><p>These positive results in the ITT/ITP analysis were preserved across major subgroups of patients in the ITT/ITP analysis, including each gender, the elderly, subjects previously treated with a VKA, subjects with a prior history of stroke, TIA or systemic embolism, subjects in each of the 4 specified geographic regions, those who qualified for the lower dose, and those enrolled at US sites.</p><p>The primary endpoint findings were also supported by numerical imbalances for most important secondary efficacy endpoints that favored apixaban over warfarin in the ITT/ITP analysis. These endpoints included the rates of strokes (all types combined), hemorrhagic strokes, fatal strokes, systemic emboli, vascular deaths, and non-vascular deaths. The results for myocardial infarction also favored apixaban. The results for death also support the primary endpoint findings, and are discussed under a separate heading below.</p><p>There was a small imbalance of pure ischemic strokes in favor of warfarin in the ITT population during the ITP (140 vs. 136 events occurring during the ITP). However, when ischemic strokes with hemorrhagic conversion are also included, the results slightly favored apixaban (152 vs. 156), and the additional inclusion of strokes of uncertain type also favored apixaban (166 vs. 177 for the combined categories). There were few systemic emboli and the difference in rate between the treatment arms was small. Thus the primary endpoint results favoring apixaban were driven mostly by an excess of hemorrhagic strokes in the warfarin arm (40 vs. 78). While all strokes were counted as efficacy events, hemorrhagic stroke is a risk of anticoagulation, not something that is prevented by anticoagulation. Thus, if apixaban is superior to warfarin in terms of stroke, it is superior because it causes less hemorrhagic stroke than warfarin. There is a modest (non-significant) difference between apixaban and warfarin in terms of reducing the rate of ischemic stroke, the primary reason for giving anticoagulants to patients with atrial fibrillation. In the pre-specified, 4-step hierarchical analysis plan, step 3 was a superiority analysis for time to ISTH major bleeding, the primary safety endpoint. This analysis was robustly successful and is discussed further in the safety summary.</p><p>Step 4 in the hierarchy was an analysis of superiority of apixaban for time to all-cause death, conducted in a manner similar to that of the primary endpoint ITT/ITP analysis. This was just barely successful: the HR was 0.89, with a 95% CI of 0.80 to 1.00 (p=0.0465). Hazard ratios for CV death and non-CV death differed little from each other and from the all-cause death HR.</p><p>The following issues are relevant to the interpretation of the efficacy results of the trial:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study medication errors and other trial execution issues in ARISTOTLE:</head><p>The clinical reviewers are concerned that study medication errors and deficiencies in monitoring and the data quality assurance process may have affected outcomes in ARISTOTLE. This complex issue is described in depth in Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.</p><p>, there is explicit language in Sec. 14 of the Applicant's proposed PI regarding superiority to warfarin.</p><p>The primary support is the just-barely significant reduction in time to allcause death in the ITT/ITP analysis (HR=0.89, 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.00, p=0.0465). However, one additional death in the apixaban arm or one fewer death in the warfarin arm would negate the statistical significance of this finding. An analysis with a variable cutoff date that includes a 30 day follow-up period for treated patients after the last dose of study drug (rather than the ITT/ITP analysis, in which all completing patients (about 75% of the total) were still on treatment at the analysis cutoff date) was slightly less favorable for apixaban, with p = 0.08 and an upper limit of the HR of 1.01 <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">(Table 46</ref>).</p><p>In addition, 590 patients (3.2% of those randomized) discontinued follow-up alive during the study and had no information on vital status at the cut-off date for the ITT/ITP analysis of death; they were censored on the date of their last contact prior to the cut-off date. As discussed in Sec. 3, there were systemic blinding issues in this study that might have led to unblinding of individuals or even most patients at a site. If such unblinding occurred, ascertainment bias might have affected the vital status tracking of dropouts, thus potentially biasing the mortality results.</p><p>Also, the results of analyses based on site-specific INR control suggest that unlike for the primary endpoint results, better INR control was associated with less favorable results for apixaban for all-cause death. The Applicant's analyses show at sites above the median TTR, the HR for all cause death was 0.93, and sites in the top quartile of However, as in the ROCKET study of rivaroxaban, in the 30 days after the last dose of blinded study drug, there were significantly more primary endpoint events (mostly ischemic strokes) in the apixaban arm than in the warfarin arm, with a HR of about 4 (21 vs 5 events). Events were distributed throughout the 30 day period and not concentrated at the beginning of the transition period. In the apixaban arm, there were 3 hemorrhagic strokes, all in subjects who received open-label VKA treatment, and all occurring in the second half of the 30 day post-dose period. Although speculative, these 3 events could have been related to warfarin use. INR information during this period was not routinely collected, and was absent for the vast majority of subjects. However, less than 50% of subjects were receiving a VKA at the start of the study, suggesting that some investigators did not customarily manage warfarin in a manner consistent with practice guidelines used in the U.S. and the European Union (EU). Accordingly, it may be that INR control was suboptimal following the end of the study in many subjects.</p><p>There was an analogous finding (i.e., a significantly increased rate of stroke/SE in the 30 days after the last dose of study drug in the apixaban arm compared to the warfarin arm) in completing patients in AVERROES, the aspirin controlled study of apixaban in patients with AFib who had failed or were deemed unsuitable for VKA therapy. In that study, no completing patient was known to have received VKA treatment, so this explanation for the difference in stroke rate is not applicable.</p><p>The Applicant did not collect information on the concentration and function of clotting system constituents after cessation of long term treatment with apixaban, and nothing is known about the pharmacodynamics of warfarin that is initiated in this setting. Given the findings in ARISTOTLE and AVERROES, it would be desirable for the Applicant to collect information on this issue.</p><p>For more information regarding the rate of events after discontinuation of study drug in ARISTOTLE see Sec. 6.1.10.2.2, and for information on the Applicant's proposed instructions for the transition from apixaban to warfarin see Sec. 5.3.1.5.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dosing regimen:</head><p>The Applicant evaluated one dosing regimen in its pivotal trial: 5 mg of apixaban bid for most patients, 2.5 mg bid for patients with at least 2 of 3 specified risk factors for bleeding. The Applicant established that this regimen overall was superior to warfarin for the primary efficacy and safety endpoint. Only 5% of subjects qualified for the 2.5 mg bid dose. Safety and efficacy results in this subgroup of subjects were slightly more favorable for apixaban than in the much larger subgroups that qualified for the 5 mg bid dose, so the dose reduction criteria seem reasonable. However, criteria for dose reduction other than those selected by the Applicant may also be reasonable. The Clinical Review: Nhi Beasley and Martin Rose Application type: Priority, NDA 202155 ELIQUIS (apixaban) 22 same regimen was used in AVERROES, an aspirin controlled trial of apixaban in patients with AFib who were not candidates for warfarin therapy.</p><p>This dosing regimen was based primarily on the results of a parallel-arm dose finding study in post-operative orthopedic surgery patients at risk for VTE. At the EOP2 meeting for the AFib program, we reviewed the relevant data and agreed to the use of this regimen in both ARISTOTLE and AVERROES prospectively. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Sec. 6.1.8)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adequacy of anticoagulation in the warfarin treatment arm and constancy assumption issues:</head><p>Although the primary efficacy analysis in this study involves non-inferiority to warfarin, satisfaction of the constancy assumption would not be a critical issue if we accept the nominal superiority of apixaban over warfarin in the prespecified primary endpoint analysis. Nonetheless, the constancy assumption was satisfied for ARISTOTLE with respect to the historical trials that established the effectiveness of warfarin for preventing stroke in patients with AFib. For additional information on the constancy assumptions and other aspects of warfarin use in ARISTOTLE, see Sec. 6.1.10.1).</p><p>Quality of INR control in the warfarin arm in ARISTOTLE was in between that obtained in the ROCKET study of rivaroxaban (another study satisfying the constancy assumption with respect to use of warfarin) and the better results obtained in RE-LY, but was closer to RE-LY than to ROCKET in this regard. Thus, anticoagulation in ARISTOTLE was good enough so that the overall findings of non-inferiority or superiority to warfarin should not be rejected due to inadequate dosing in the control arm. However, for subjects at sites with TTR above the median, and in the best quartile of TTR, results for all-cause death suggest lack of superiority over warfarin, which might be a labeling issue (see text above and Sec. 6.1.10.1.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Overview</head><p>Most of the safety data for apixaban comes from ARISTOTLE (trial discussed in Sec 5.3.1). This was the largest randomized trial for the reduction in risk of stroke in AFib to date. As mentioned earlier, over 18,000 subjects with at least one risk factor for stroke were randomized to warfarin or apixaban in this non-inferiority trial; of the subjects randomized to apixaban, &gt;95% of subjects received 5 mg po BID. Apixaban 2.5 mg po BID was for subjects with two out of three risk factors for bleeding at baseline. The mean duration of exposure, ~ 1.7 years, was adequate and similar to that of other large antithrombotic trials. The information from this trial alone is adequate to characterize the safety of apixaban. However, for specific events of interest (drug induced liver injury (DILI), rare serious neurologic adverse events, and concomitant antiplatelet therapy) the reviewer also analyzed the data in other trials.</p><p>The primary safety adjudicated endpoint was ISTH major bleed (i.e., bleeding leading to a 2 unit transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBC) qualifies); a bleed that can be insignificant and readily reversible. However, the ISTH definition has historically been Clinical Review: Nhi Beasley and Martin Rose Application type: Priority, NDA 202155 ELIQUIS (apixaban) 23 used in patients receiving long-term anticoagulation and was the primary safety endpoint in the last two NDAs for this indication. Apixaban was consistently superior to warfarin for ISTH major bleed as well as for other serious bleeding (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 13</ref>). While we do not like to compare across studies, the reviewer did examine across studies to look for consistency (albeit there were differences between RE-LY, ROCKET-AF and ARISTOTLE). Although the other antithrombotics were not superior to warfarin on ISTH major bleed, they each had a significant reduction in ICH, similar to apixaban.</p><p>The bleeding superiority findings in ARISTOTLE are robust (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 81</ref> Sensitivity Analyses of Superiority Findings for Bleeding Endpoints). To overturn the results, an additional 87 ISTH major bleeds in the apixaban arm are needed, or 93 fewer ISTH major bleeds in the warfarin arm are needed.</p><p>The site of major bleeds was mostly in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (not a critical organ), followed by intracranial, then by intra-ocular <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">(Table 86)</ref>. Like dabigatran and rivaroxaban, the site of most major bleeds was the GI tract, however, in contrast to both antithrombotics, the annual rate of major GI bleed was lower on apixaban compared to warfarin (by 0.1%) and relative to warfarin, there was no difference in major GI bleed. With the exception of intracranial and intra-ocular bleeds, the site of major bleeds was similar between subjects on either treatment. There were numerically more intra-ocular major bleeds on apixaban (n=33) compared to warfarin (n=22). There are pre-clinical data to support that there may be a pharmacologic basis for this; apixaban radioactivity was still present in the eyes of rats at 168 hours post dose while it was last measureable in plasma at 24 hours. If apixaban is approved, the reviewer recommends that information on major bleeding at this critical site be collected and reported to the Agency in their Safety updates. Attempts should be made to collect adequate information on the subject's medical history to assess if a particular patient population may be at greater risk for major intra-ocular bleeding.</p><p>The reviewer conducted many analyses of all ARISTOTLE bleeding definitions and their relationship with TTR (time in range, time above range, time below range), a measure of warfarin control and safety. The overall mean TTR in ARISTOTLE was 62% (median 66%). e The many analyses did not show a consistent relationship between bleeding and TTR, suggesting that using TTR might not be a sensitive marker of individual warfarin control and ultimately bleeding events.</p><p>Analysis of countries by TTR quartiles shows that more than half of all US sites were above the median TTR of 66%; the same was true for Canada (the third highest enrolling country) (see <ref type="figure">Figure 22)</ref>. Russia was the second highest enrolling country, but more than half of the subjects were in the lowest quartile of TTR, suggesting that warfarin control was poor in most subjects treated in Russia. The Ukraine, China, and India were the 9 th , 10 th and 11 th top enrolling countries, but more than 75% of subjects in those countries were below the trial mean TTR of 62%. 24 Subgroup analyses of ISTH major bleed were generally consistent with the overall findings. A rather novel finding was that females on apixaban had less major bleeding than males and the relative benefit over warfarin was greater in females than in males. This finding is somewhat contrary to the results from a dedicated pharmacokinetic (PK) study that showed females have 15-18% higher concentrations than males, so one would not expect less bleeding in females based on PK. This reviewer is cautious about making conclusions based on un-prespecified subgroup analyses since findings can be spurious, and so would not recommend that this finding be highlighted in labeling. Subgroup findings are hypothesis generating. As age increased, so did the risk of major bleeds, but relative to warfarin there was less major bleeding on apixaban in subjects â‰¥ 75 years old. While there were 5 subgroups f on apixaban that appeared to lose their bleeding advantage over warfarin, for many of these subgroups the effect size was still close to the overall trial effect size [ISTH major bleed apixaban vs. warfarin HR (95%CI): 0.69 (0.60, 0.80)], so the reason may be due in part to smaller number of subjects. A group worth noting where this might not be the case was in diabetics [HR (95%CI): 0.96 (0.74, 1.25)]. Many of the intra-ocular bleeds were in diabetics and if apixaban is approved, the Applicant should collect and analyze demographic and concomitant disease information in patients that have intra-ocular bleeding. Warfarin treated subjects that were VKA experienced did not have lower bleeding rates compared to VKA naÃ¯ve subjects. Compared to the overall trial, the rates of major bleeding in the US were higher (+0.7%) and the relative benefit of apixaban over warfarin was slightly less, HR 0.75 (95%CI, 0.56, 1.00), nominal p-value=0.0497. Apixaban 2.5 mg BID, given to subjects having at least 2 of 3 risk factors for bleeding (age â‰¥ 80 years, weight â‰¤ 60 kg or serum creatinine â‰¥1.5 mg/dL) at baseline, was safe and effective. This dose adjustment was not based on PK (exposure in these subjects treated with 2.5 mg was 25% lower than (not equivalent) subjects treated with 5 mg). Most subjects qualified by age and weight. Although &lt;5% of subjects received the lower dose, apixaban 2.5 mg was superior to warfarin on major bleed and stroke/SE (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 94</ref>). Major bleeding was higher in subjects with at least 2 out of 3 risk factors (despite the lower apixaban concentrations) compared to those without 2 out of 3 risk factors, suggesting that bleeding in this subgroup was likely more due to the population rather than apixaban. The dose adjustment translated into a greater relative benefit over warfarin [(HR (95%CI) for apixaban 2.5 mg/warfarin, 0.50 (0.29, 0.86) versus apixaban 5 mg/warfarin, 0.71(0.61, 0.82)]. While the rate of stroke/se was also higher in this population, apixaban 2.5 mg had greater relative benefit over warfarin [(HR (95%CI) for apixaban 2.5 mg/warfarin, 0.40 (0.18, 0.88) versus apixaban 5 mg/warfarin, 0.80 (0.65, 0.98)]. If apixaban is approved, the lower dose should be approved and prescribed as used in ARISTOTLE. </p></div>

The reviewer cannot explain this, but it should be noted in labeling.</p><p>Generally, there were no differences in reasons for treatment discontinuation (by System Organ Class) between treatment arms. However in the trial as a whole, more subjects discontinued for an AE in the warfarin arm (8.4% vs. 7.6%, respectively). This was driven in part by a nearly three-fold higher number of warfarin-treated subjects with discontinuations for injury, poisoning, and procedural complications (63 (0.7%) vs. 22 (0.2%) subjects, respectively). The most common reason for treatment discontinuation was in the SOC of nervous system disorders (1.5% of subjects on apixaban vs. 1.7% on warfarin) which consisted mostly of stroke/TIA events, followed by gastrointestinal disorders. There were numerically more major bleeds after apixaban discontinuation (n=44) compared to after warfarin discontinuation (n=29). The excess bleeds did not appear to be from the inability to properly initiate warfarin treatment. Unfortunately data collection after drug discontinuation was too sparse to definitively determine the cause of the excess bleeds.</p><p>Apixaban does not appear to cause drug induced liver injury (DILI). There was one fatal case of hepatic failure that occurred on apixaban that independent, blinded, hepatologists judged as possibly related to apixaban or another drug (tianeptine). Otherwise, there were no probable cases and the number of potential Hy's Law cases was balanced between arms.</p><p>Apixaban does not appear to cause serious neurologic adverse events. In a Phase 2 (P2) dose ranging trial there was 1 case of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) and 1 case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in subjects taking apixaban 5 mg QD and 10 mg QD, respectively. Following the two reports, the Applicant enhanced surveillance for neurological events, obtained neurological consultations for specific events, and instituted external, blinded, independent neurologist assessments of specific SAEs. There were a total of 6 GBS cases, 3 ALS cases and 7 cases of acute polyneuropathy identified in the NDA and Safety Update Report (SUR). All but one case were blindly reviewed; of these, all consensus assessments were "unlikely to be drug-related". One subject treated with apixaban did not have a consensus assessment as of late April 2012, but the three individual neurologists' assessments were 2 unlikely, 1 possible. Serious neurologic AEs occurred infrequently and were balanced between treatment arms in ARISTOTLE. Based on the totality of the data, the reviewer believes that apixaban does not cause serious neurologic AEs such as GBS, ALS or acute polyneuropathy.</p><p>The most common adverse event was bleeding. Minor bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding was lower in the apixaban arm than in the warfarin arm (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table  101</ref>). The reviewer was unable to complete the analysis of common adverse events because the sponsor's AE dataset contained errors that were likely created by an investigator filling out two or more CRFs for one unique event, a SAE CRF and a NSAE </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>26</head><p>(non-serious adverse event) CRF. Monitoring did not appear to catch this. There was no systematic pattern for how this error happened, nor was there a way to easily fix the dataset since the AE term was sometimes mapped to different higher MedDRA terms. The Applicant's analysis of common AEs indicates that the frequency of AEs were similar between apixaban and warfarin.</p><p>There were no significant laboratory findings. Thrombocytopenia was similar between treatment arms. There were no significant effects on vital signs or ECGs. The Thorough QT study was negative.</p><p>Renal elimination does not play a large role in the excretion of apixaban since its elimination is multimodal. However, it is known that subjects with renal impairment are inherently at risk for more adverse events, including bleeds and strokes. Event rates of both major bleeding and stroke/se increase in both treatment arms as level of renal impairment worsens <ref type="figure">(Figure 26 and Figure 27</ref>). Relative to warfarin, apixaban has less major bleeding in subjects with mild-severe renal impairment. For stroke/se, there was no suggestion of worse outcome on apixaban relative to warfarin.</p><p>Apixaban is a substrate for CYP3A4 and the drug efflux transporter proteins, pglycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). The Clinical Pharmacology reviewers recommend, and the reviewer agrees, to avoid concomitant use with strong CYP3A4/P-gp inducers, and reduce the apixaban dose by half when coadministered with a strong CYP3A44/P-gp inhibitor <ref type="figure">(Figure 6)</ref>.</p><p>Data from APPRAISE-2, an ACS trial where randomization was stratified by single or dual antiplatelet therapy shows that bleeding rates are 2-8 times greater on apixaban compared to placebo. The bleeding risk was ~2 times greater in subjects on dual antiplatelet treatment and apixaban compared to single antiplatelet treatment and apixaban. Although the population in APPRAISE-2 is different from those in ARISTOTLE, to put the bleeding in perspective, the rate of ISTH bleeding in APPRAISE-2 on apixaban plus single antiplatelet therapy is almost 3 times greater, and with dual antiplatelet therapy is 6 times greater, than in ARISTOTLE where apixaban was used alone. The rate of bleeding (TIMI major and ISTH major) on apixaban with single antiplatelet therapy in APPRAISE-2 was similar to the rate of bleeding on warfarin in ARISTOTLE. So in patients that need both an anticoagulant and an antiplatelet it may be reasonable to use apixaban with a single antiplatelet agent. Because of the risk of bleeding, the reviewer discourages the use of apixaban with dual antiplatelet therapy.</p></div>

There are 6 placebo-controlled studies of warfarin in patients with AFib. Taken together, they provide compelling evidence that warfarin is effective in reducing the risk of strokes in this setting, with FDA's meta-analysis showing a 64% reduction in the stroke rate. g A published meta-analysis suggests a more modest reduction in the rate of all-cause death using these same studies, 1 but this finding is not recognized in the warfarin label.</p><p>Aspirin provides only modest protection against stroke and is recommended as an alternative to warfarin in patients with low stroke risk or in patients in whom warfarin is contraindicated in the AHA/ACC/ESC consensus guidelines on the management of atrial fibrillation. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> However, warfarin has been shown to be substantially superior to aspirin, especially in patients at higher risk of stroke, 1, 3 and this use of aspirin is not included in its label.</p><p>In October 2010, the Agency approved dabigatran, a Factor IIa inhibitor, based on RE-LY, a global, non-inferiority trial that compared two blinded doses of dabigatran to open label warfarin. Dabigatran 150 mg was superior to warfarin in reducing the risk of stroke/SE (primary endpoint) and no different from warfarin on ISTH major bleeding (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>). Dabigatran 150 mg had a significant benefit for both hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes. Dabigatran 110 mg was non-inferior to warfarin on stroke/SE and superior to warfarin on ISTH major bleeding. Dabigatran 110 mg was significantly better than warfarin on hemorrhagic strokes, but not on ischemic strokes. Moreover, the absolute risk of ischemic stroke was higher on dabigatran 110 mg than it was on dabigatran 150 mg or warfarin. Relative to each other, dabigatran 150 mg caused more bleeding than dabigatran 110 mg, HR 1.16 (95%CI, 1.00, 1.34), but the higher dose was significantly better at reducing the risk of stroke/SE compared to the lower dose HR 0.72 (95%CI 0.58, 0.90).</p><p>Given that the threshold for an ISTH major bleed, the primary safety endpoint in RE-LY, was low (only a 2 g/dL reduction in Hg qualified), the prevention of a stroke was weighted heavier than the causation of a major bleed. Thus, the data favored approval of dabigatran 150 mg only. That said, the Agency searched for a population where the benefit outweighed the risk on dabigatran 110 mg and was unable to find one. </p></div>

Anticoagulant agents affecting the intrinsic and/or extrinsic coagulation cascade may have their bleeding risks potentiated by anti-platelet co-therapies. For a discussion of this topic with apixaban, see Sec. 7</p><p>Warfarin is associated with a myriad of drug-drug, and drug-food (and alcohol) interactions. Many mechanisms exist for these interactions, including metabolic inhibition of multiple cytochrome P450 isozymes (but primarily CYP2C9), drug reduction of the gut flora thereby reducing Vitamin K, and drug displacement of warfarin (a highly protein bound drug). Subjects may also metabolize warfarin at different speeds. Additionally, warfarin activity is determined partially by genetic factors; polymorphisms in the genes VKORC1 and CYP2C9 explain in part the difficulty in dosing warfarin to a therapeutic INR. The PK or PD interactions with warfarin may result in over-or underanticoagulation and associated problems of bleeding or thrombosis, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">5</ref> While many of these mechanisms are specific to warfarin, those mechanisms that affect the clotting cascade could potentially affect apixaban.</p><p>Maintenance of target levels of anticoagulation in patients taking warfarin is highly variable across regions, individual study sites or practices, and patients. In the global RE-LY trial of dabigatran vs. warfarin, which supported approval of dabigatran for the apixaban proposed indication, an analysis of quartiles of site-specific levels of time in therapeutic range (TTR) of INR showed an inverse relationship between quartiles of TTR (with the 4 th quartile having the highest TTR) and the rate of efficacy and safety events in the warfarin study arm.

Dr. Temple suggested that a trial in "lower-risk patients normally treated with aspirin" might also be done. Also, if the warfarin-controlled study failed to meet its endpoint, but apixaban was superior to aspirin in the other study, the latter finding could support approval. â€¢ A single study, a double-blind warfarin controlled NI trial, could also support approval if FDA agreed to the NI and the analysis plan. â€¢ VKAs other than warfarin could be used in a global trial, but the majority of control arm subjects should be on warfarin. â€¢ In the study of apixaban vs. aspirin, the reason for not taking a VKA should be recorded for each patient. â€¢ The proposed dose of aspirin (300-325 mg) was acceptable (note: this is not the dose of aspirin that was used in AVERROES, which was 81-324 mg daily). </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.1">Background and treatment dispensing</head><p>Medication errors are defined as dispensing the wrong type of study medication to a subject. In this study, of subjects randomized to apixaban, 5% (considered at high risk for bleeding), were to receive active apixaban 2.5 mg and placebo warfarin tablets; the rest were to receive active apixaban 5 mg and placebo warfarin. Subjects randomized to warfarin were to receive active warfarin 2 mg tablets (to be titrated to the target INR) and placebo apixaban.</p><p>Thus, medication errors could conceivably result in a patient having concomitantly:</p><p>â€¢ Two different active products (warfarin and apixaban)</p><p>â€¢ Two placebos â€¢ The wrong apixaban tablet (2.5 mg instead of 5, or vice versa) and a placebo â€¢ Rarely, two bottles of active warfarin or two bottles of active apixaban â€¢ Rarely, the wrong active medication and a placebo</p><p>In the sponsor's analysis two scenarios were not counted as errors: 1) having the wrong apixaban dose, and 2) having a bottle with the wrong container number if the treatment was correct. This is because the type of medication was correct. Apixaban bottles (and their matching placebos) will be referred to as "apixaban/placebo". Warfarin (and their matching placebos) will be referred to as "warfarin/placebo". Apixaban/placebo bottles were noticeably larger than the warfarin/placebo bottles (insert FIG). Each apixaban/placebo strength was packaged in similar bottles, but the strength was clearly labeled on the bottle. Of course, placebo and active drug had similar labeling and bottles. Perhaps adding to the complexity of this trial was that the days supply for apixaban/placebo and warfarin/placebo differed. Apixaban/placebo contained 200 tablets, a 100 day supply, whereas warfarin/placebo bottles contained 100 tablets of the 2 mg strength. Since warfarin was titrated to an INR between 2 and 3, the days supply of a bottle was variable. If the average dose was 6 mg/day (3 tablets), a bottle would last about 33 days, and the subject might need 3-4 bottles of warfarin/placebo prior to needing another bottle of apixaban/placebo. Thus, the consequence of receiving an erroneous apixaban bottle might be more lasting than the consequences of receiving an erroneous warfarin bottle, but one might expect more errors with warfarin/placebo bottles because more were dispensed.</p><p>Each time a bottle was dispensed to a patient, the following sequence of events was supposed to occur:</p><p>1. The site entered specified information into the telephonic IVRS system, including the patient number and the last 3 warfarin (active or placebo) doses in mg. 2. The IVRS system ( replied in a computer-generated voice with the unique container number(s) for the bottle(s) to be dispensed to the subject. Each bottle of study drug had a unique container number. 3. The IVRS system also faxed or emailed the container number(s) to the site within 24 hours. The IVRS system retained an electronic record of the event. Note that an open stock system was used; bottles were not stocked in "kits" for identified subjects. Instead, any bottle at a site conceivably could be dispensed to any subject. 5. Site staff removed the tear-off portion of the bottle label, which had the unique container number, and affixed it to CRF page 800 or another piece of paper kept at the site. From the start of the study in December 2006 until July 2009, it was intended that these sheets would be collected by site monitors and sent to BMS at the end of the study; copies were to be retained at the site. During this period, the labels were affixed to CRF page 800. In July of 2009 BMS determined that the labels were to be affixed to a piece of paper kept at the site (not a CRF page), and these source documents would not be sent to BMS, but were to be retained at the site. 6. The patient was given the bottle(s). 7. Site staff manually entered into the eCRF system the unique container number of each bottle dispensed. 8. When the patient returned with a bottle, the investigator manually entered the unique container number into the eCRF system on the appropriate page.</p><p>Some of the opportunities for errors to occur in this process are highlighted:</p><p>â€¢ The wrong subject ID could be entered into the IVRS system.</p><p>â€¢ The wrong bottle could be pulled from the shelf and given to a subject. Note that each bottle had a unique bar code, but it was not used. â€¢ Site staff could have entered into the eCRF a number not matching the container number on the subject's bottle. This could occur in a "dispensed" field as well as in "returned" and "verified" fields (when the subject returned to clinic). Site staff could have used the IVRS fax to enter the container number and not the actual bottle (which could have been mistakenly dispensed). If this method of entering the container number was used and the subject had the wrong container number, then the eCRF would match the data in the IVRS and indicate that the subject had the correct bottle, but the subject would actually have the wrong bottle. â€¢ The tear off-label or paper on which it was affixed might be lost or displaced, or the label could be affixed to the wrong subject record.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer comment: This reply started a cycle of questions between the Agency and the Applicant whereby the Applicant's attempts to address our questions</head><p>only left more questions. This dialogue continued until late April when we continued to have more questions and discovered that the dataset the Applicant was using for the majority of their analyses did not match the information in the CRF. Although we now know considerably more about the medication error issue than we did in January, it remains a moving target and we still have questions.</p><p>The Applicant indicated that the reported numbers were for subjects that received the wrong active medication; since more warfarin/placebo bottles were dispensed, then there were more chances for error with the warfarin/placebo bottles (as the study report indicates). Thus, there would be less active treatment errors in subjects randomized to warfarin because these subjects had fewer occasions to receive apixaban/placebo treatment (since this bottle should only need replacing after 100 days).</p><p>We asked the Applicant to redo its analysis of errors, and count either erroneous dispensing of placebo or active drug as an error. We also asked for data on a per bottle basis, rather than a per patient basis, and data on what was actually supplied in the case of each error.</p><p>1. The Applicant provided the information we requested. Counting erroneous dispensing and returns of active or placebo, there were 8.6% and 7.9% of patients in the apixaban and warfarin arms, respectively, that had medication errors. Additional information on errors is provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 3</ref>.  Note that the per-bottle error rate was similar in the two arms, at 0.38%. Notably, there were about 6 times as many errors involving erroneous dispensing of warfarin active/placebo as apixaban active/placebo. However, the total of warfarin active/placebo bottles dispensed was only 2.3 times the number of apixaban bottles dispensed, meaning that the error rate for warfarin active/placebo bottles was more than twice as high as for apixaban active/placebo bottles. This discrepancy was not initially explained.</p><p>The medication errors represented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 3</ref> were discovered by comparing the IVRS derived database of medications to be dispensed with the eCRF-derived database of bottles dispensed or bottles returned (including bottles "verified", i.e., brought back the site for counting of tablets but then taken home again by the patient). This comparison would not initially catch an error resulting from dispensing an erroneous bottle if the site entered the IVRS generated-bottle number into the eCRF instead of the number of the bottle actually dispensed in error, although the error might be picked up when the bottle was returned. . Additional data were provided with respect to what was dispensed in cases of known dispensing errors. The most common substitution for active apixaban was placebo apixaban, and vice versa. The most common substitution for active warfarin was placebo warfarin, and vice versa. However, substitutions of active for active, one type of placebo for another, the opposite active for placebo, and one apixaban strength for another occurred. Thus, some patients were dispensed two actives of different types, some two placebos, some two actives of the same type, and some the wrong active or the wrong dose (of apixaban) with placebo.</p><p>The Applicant performed analyses of key endpoint (stroke/SE, all-cause death, major bleeding) in which patients were censored at the time of their first medication error. The result of these analyses were each slightly more favorable for apixaban than the ITT analyses of the same endpoints.</p><p>Because the data provided did not eliminate the possibility that a site simply entered into the CRF the number of the bottle they were supposed to dispense rather than the one they actually did dispense, we asked the Applicant to review the CRF 800s that they have in house (both original and scanned/faxed copies from the site) and compare the container numbers to the IVRS and the eCRF data. We also asked for:</p><p>â€¢ analyses of TTR as a metric of the effect of medication errors on control of INR â€¢ a sensitivity analysis of the data, taking into account the error rate of medication errors already observed and how many more errors would have to be observed, , to overturn the non-inferiority and the superiority findings. â€¢ a description of monitoring activities with respect to medication errors and corrective actions taken when errors were found, both at the site level and systemically. â€¢ data for the event rate data for ISTH major bleed, stroke/se, and all cause death by the treatments the patient was actually receiving at the time of the event, 30 days, 60 days and 90 days after the incorrect treatment was received, along with data sets and the SAS codes used for the analyses.</p><p>2. The Applicant responded in part to the above request on 2/21/2012. a. Comparison of IVRS data to bottle labels: The Applicant attempted to enter data on dispensed bottles using scanned copies of the bottle labels in house, but there were substantial legibility issues with the scanned copies. We also had difficulties reading the bottle number from scanned copies of the labels.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 4</ref>. A mismatch occurred when a bottle label number associated with a patient was not one of the bottles numbers assigned by the IVRS system to the same patient. The table also includes for purposes of comparison the data on mismatches between the clinical database and the IVRS system from <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 3</ref>. Note that substitution of one active dose of apixaban for another (i.e., a 2.5 mg active tablet substituted for a 5 mg active tablet, or vice versa) were not counted as errors by the Applicant.  The data using the bottle labels to identify dispensed drug suggest a lower perbottle error rate than was calculated from the comparison using the clinical database as the source of what was actually dispensed. The error rate using the bottle labels was 0.1% and 0.15% in the apixaban and warfarin arms, respectively. Reviewer Comment: The initial monitoring plan provides for collection of the CRF pages with the bottle labels by BMS. We understand that this was to be done at the end of the study. However, after an amendment to the monitoring plan in July 2009, at which point more than 12,000 study patients had been enrolled and treated, the monitoring plan was amended so that the original CRF pages with the bottle labels would be kept at the site.</p><p>Nonetheless, the Applicant argues that the 8% of original labels collected are an unbiased (but certainly not random) sample of the total. The Applicant provided data indicating that in patients with collected bottle labels, information about error rates based on the clinical database was similar to the data for the study population as a whole, suggesting that the bottle label sample is representative. However, as indicated in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, 29,706 (83%) of the 35,859 collected bottle labels, from 1075 (71%) of the 1512 patients with bottle labels possessed by the Applicant, were from sites in Russia, which enrolled only 9.9% of the ITT patient population. This suggests that the population with collected bottle labels may not be representative of the study as whole.</p></div>

The Applicant suggests that some the errors found by comparing the trial database bottle dispensing and return data with the IVRS database amounts to mere "transcription errors," not errors in dispensing. Their evidence for this comes from the fact that among bottles that did not match IVRS assigned bottles, a high percentage of the bottle numbers of bottles returned and a lower percentage of the bottles dispensed do not 44 correspond to bottles that were sent to the relevant site (determined from the drug shipment database). For example, in the apixaban arm, a total of 859 medication errors were identified by comparing the dispensing and return data to the IVRS. Of these 712 (83%) involved the identification of mismatched bottles that were entered into the study database as being dispensed or returned that should not have been at the site if the shipping records are correct. In warfarin arm patients, the analogous data are 645 of 795 mismatched bottles (82.3%) that should have been shipped to other sites. Most of the bottles that should not have been at the site were identified as bottles that were returned (but never dispensed). The Applicant suggests that these represent transcription errors. Another interpretation is that the shipping records are suspect, and that the bottle dispensed was not correctly recorded -perhaps the investigator simply entered the number given to him or her by the IVRS.</p><p>In addition, The Applicant compared the bottle label data to the clinical trial database information on medication errors. Although the clinical trial database suggested that the per-bottle error rate was more than 3X the per-bottle error rate derived from the bottle label database, only eight of the 44 errors (18%) found in the bottle-label database (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 5</ref>) were also found to be errors in the clinical trial database, meaning that 36 errors (82%) were not picked up in the clinical trial database. Note that the monitors were supposed to compare the bottle labels to the information in the clinical trial database. The Applicant suggests that the reason that some of these errors were not picked up by the monitors is that they do not represent dispensing errors, but mere errors of record-keeping at the site: the bottles were correctly dispensed, but the bottle labels were placed in the wrong patient file. The evidence for this contention is the fact for some bottle label errors, the bottle represented by the label was recorded as being dispensed to a different patient at the same site in the study database and the medication log kept at the site.  Denominator for percentages is n in first data row.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment: This last claim by the Applicant is difficult to evaluate. If site staff simply used their notes from the IVRS call or the IVRS fax or email as the source for the information in the study database and medication log, those entries would match the IVRS database, but the bottle could have been dispensed to someone else at the site. Regardless of the identity of the patient that actually received the bottle in question, the discrepancy between the bottle label data and the study database or medication log might have been picked up by good monitoring and possibly resolved.</head><p>Reviewer Comment: The Applicant may well be right that some of the errors in the clinical database may represent only transcription errors, and the patient received the correct bottle (or another bottle of the same type), but the number of a bottle of a different type was entered into the database. The fact that many of the errors involve bottles that were recorded as being sent to other sites supports that notion that these errors may simply be errors in data entry.</p><p>A very different picture results from analysis of the bottle label data. Of the more than 35,000 bottles for which the sponsor has bottle labels, our analysis indicates that every bottle was sent to the site where it was supposedly dispensed.</p><p>This reviewer draws the following inferences from these data:</p><p>â€¢ The clinical database information on bottles dispensed and returned is probably not reliable, â€¢ study monitoring did not appear to have found inconsistencies between the bottle labels and the eCRF (the source of information in the clinical database) and did not lead to effective preventive measures such as modifying the errorprone dispensing system adopted by the Applicant, â€¢ and, most important, the best evidence of what was actually dispensed to the patients probably is the bottle label information. Only 8% of the labels were collected by the Applicant; the remainder is presumably still at the investigational sites. c. The Applicant argues that the good TTR observed in ARISTOTLE (an overall mean of 62% and median of 66% indicates that warfarin control was not affected much by medication errors. However, TTR is not a sensitive measure of the effect of sporadic medication errors. The most important medication error that would affect TTR in warfarin arm patients would be substitution of placebo warfarin for active warfarin. If one bottle were substituted, the patient might receive placebo for the days he or she took tablets from the bottle, which might be less than one month. By the time of the next INR visit, the patient might have resumed taking active warfarin, and perhaps returned to near his or her usual INR level. Even if the patient was still under-treated, the amount of imputed time out of range would be some fraction of the number of days in between the previous in-range value and the next in-range value in range. To gauge the effect of a placebo-for-active warfarin medication error, we assumed that a patient was in the study for the warfarin arm median of 88 weeks with 65% of days in range (very near the trial median). This patient would have 57.2 weeks in range. If a substitution of placebo for active warfarin reduced the time in range by 4 weeks to 53.2 weeks, the patient's TTR would fall to 60.5% -a reduction of 4.5%. If this occurred in 1/10 of warfarin arm patients in the trial (a rate considerably higher than that suggested by the Applicant), and this patient was representative, the overall TTR would fall by less than Â½% due to the medication errors.</p><p>However, stopping warfarin or apixaban therapy for 28 days due to a medication error could increase the rate of stroke (see Sec. 6.1.10.2.</p><p>Taking two active drugs for a month could increase the rate of bleeding. Thus, the fact that overall TTR in ARISTOTLE was reasonably good does not rule out the possibility that medication errors affected the trial outcome.</p><p>d. In its initial submissions regarding dispensing errors, the Applicant only counted a dispensing event as an error if the medication was of the "wrong type", i.e., the patient received a medication he or she should not have received. On March 22 and then again on April 12, we asked the sponsor to perform analyses of dispensing errors that included instances where the patient received a bottle with an erroneous bottle number, even if the medication was of the right type. Because the site was supposed to obtain the bottle number from the IVRS system at the time of the patient visit or just before the visit, we also asked the Applicant to count a dispensing event as an error of the IVRS assigned a patient a bottle, but the patient received the bottle before the assignment or more than 7 or 30 days after the assignment, because this would suggest an error at the site. 47 (according to the study database, based on the CRFs) were assigned by the IVRS from 0 to 7 days prior to the indicated dispensing event. The remainder of bottles dispensed was dispensed to a subject either before or more than 7 days after days after the bottle was assigned by the IVRS to that patient. For &lt;0.1% of bottles dispensed, that particular bottle was never assigned to the patient who received it. This would include bottles of the correct type (containing the medication the patient was supposed to receive, ignoring errors involving the wrong dose of apixaban) and also bottles of the wrong type. <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 7</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 8</ref> provide patient level data analogous to the bottlelevel data in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 6</ref>. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 7</ref> data for the two types of medication each patient was supposed to receive are disaggregated, while in <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 8</ref>, they are combined. <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 8</ref> indicates that about 7.5% and 7.9% of patients in the apixaban and warfarin arms respectively were dispensed at least one bottle that was not assigned to the patient by the IVRS or was assigned after it was dispensed or more than 7 days prior to the dispensing date. About 4.9% and 5.3% of patients in the apixaban and warfarin arms, respectively received at least one bottle that was not assigned to the patient by the IVRS or was assigned after it was dispensed or more than 30 days prior to the dispensing date.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The Applicant explained to us verbally that they believe that bottles indicated as being dispensed before being assigned represent errors in the assignment date. They also commented that many bottles that were dispensed late represent deliberate acts by the site when more than one bottle of a type was ordered by the IVRS. In such cases, the investigator might dispense one bottle while keeping the others for dispensing in the future. This claim is difficult to evaluate.</p><p>While the error rates in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 6</ref> through <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 8</ref> are not problematic, it should be noted that the dispensing field information would be inaccurate if the investigator merely copied the bottle number provide to the site by fax or email into the CRF, but dispensed a bottle with a different number. When errors in the "verified" field (for bottles brought back to the site for a tablet count and then taken home again by the patient) and the "returned" field (i.e., the final return of a bottle) are counted, the per patient error rate increases to over 30% in each arm. However, the data that include the verified and returned field information are confounded, by the fact that in many cases where a bottle indicated as verified or returned was not dispensed to the patient and the bottle was never shipped to the patient's site. However, some modest percentage of the errors involving bottle numbers in the verified and returned fields may represent true errors. Because of the uncertainty around these data, the reviewers believe that the bottle label information is the most accurate way to estimate the medication error rate.   50 e. The Applicant performed a series of assumption-based modeling analyses of key endpoint results of ARISTOTLE. The Applicant assumed a series of per-bottle error rates higher than the observed error rate of 0.38%. Assumed error rates assumed ranged from 0.5% to 1% at increments of 0.1%, then 1% to 5% at increments of 1%, and finally, an assumed error rate of 10%. The Applicant described the methodology as follows:</p><p>"In the simulations, for each assumed rate of treatment assignment errors, e.g., 0.5%, correct bottles were randomly selected and assigned to an incorrect treatment type. These simulated cases were combined with the 1654 known cases to achieve the overall error rate in treatment dispensations at the specified level; for each assumed error rate, 100 replications were generated and, for each replicate, sensitivity analyses on primary efficacy and ISTH major bleeding were performed. The sensitivity analyses used the observed endpoints in the study and followed the methodology used in the CSR analyses but excluding endpoints on or after a subject first received an incorrect bottle type and censoring subjects who did not have an endpoint prior to first receiving an incorrect bottle type."</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The Applicant presented mean results (event rates, hazard, ratio, 95% CI, and superiority p) for each run of 100 replications. Also, all-cause death comparisons were not estimated in these models.</p><p>For the primary endpoint, superiority of apixaban over warfarin (i.e., p&lt;0.05) was maintained for error rates up to and including 5%, with p=0.036 for the 5% modeling run. For ISTH major bleeding, superiority of apixaban was maintained up to including an error rate of 10%, with p=0.0013 for the 10% modeling run. For each endpoint, the general trend was a very small reduction in the hazard ratio (i.e., a change favoring apixaban) as the error rate approached 10%, with widening of the confidence intervals as progressively more patients were censored for assumed errors ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 6</ref>). In <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">Table 9</ref> the Applicant argues that this suggests that even with these very high error rates, the superiority results for the primary endpoint and ISTH major bleeding are robust. finding of superiority of apixaban over warfarin. A priori, in this type of analysis, the hazard ratio is unlikely to change very much. Instead, the confidence interval of the HR would be expected to widen as patients and data were excluded from the analysis. Eventually the CI would cross zero. This is exactly what occurred. However, the actual impact of medication errors might be extreme in either direction (i.e., towards making apixaban look better or worse than it does in the protocol-specified analyses of the relevant endpoints).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer comment: This reviewer has concerns with the Applicant's approach. The Applicant's modeling results are based on means of 100 replications of the study results with censoring based on an assumed error rate.

Patients should be censored on the basis of actual data, and the results based on those data, not the means of 100 modeling runs. There is no sense in relying on modeling when the actual data are available and could be obtained by the Applicant. would be negated only of one assumed high error rates, and that non-inferiority for these outcomes would not be threatened. These analyses are summarized below:</p><p>1. The Medical Officer who performed the efficacy review modeled the results for the primary efficacy endpoint (composite of stroke and systemic embolism). The model examined the as follows:</p><p>â€¢ The baseline case was the ITT analysis.</p><p>â€¢ The model assumed the worst case: that medication errors occurred and they biased the study only in favor of apixaban, so that when patients with errors were removed from the analysis, the study results would become less favorable for apixaban. The model assumed one type of error: substitution of warfarin placebo for active warfarin in the warfarin arm, which according to the clinical database was the most common error that would have biased the study in favor of apixaban for the primary endpoint. â€¢ Various error rates were assumed â€¢ There were two assumptions on the magnitude of the effects of errors on total stroke, which comprised most of the primary endpoint events. â€¢ The duration of the effect of the error on the event rate was assumed to be 38 days, the mean number of days that tablets from a warfarin bottle were taken, â€¢ No more than one error per patient was assumed â€¢ The number of strokes added by the various error scenarios was compared to the number of events, if subtracted from the warfarin arm, would negate the findings of superiority (13) or non-inferiority (78) of apixaban to warfarin in the ITT analysis. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 10</ref> shows the number of additional strokes that would be expected to result from various error rates as described in previous paragraph. The first 3 data rows assume per-patient error rates of 10%, 40% and 100%, with all errors resulting in 38 days of an event rate 3x the primary efficacy endpoint event rate in the warfarin arm in the ITT analysis. Note that the actual error rate was about 8% based on the clinical database and about 3% based on the bottle label database.</p><p>Dr. Bai's analysis indicated that it would take 13 fewer events in the warfarin arm to negate superiority of apixaban to warfarin, and 78 fewer events to negate non-inferiority. A 10% error rate would be expected to account for 3 extra events in the warfarin arm. The limit of 13 events to negate superiority is not closely approached until the error rate reaches 40%, when 12 errors would be expected. If all warfarin arm patients had experienced an error, 30 additional events would be expected. In this extremely unlikely scenario, superiority would be negated, but non-inferiority would not be lost when the error-induced events were eliminated from the analysis.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Dataset Quality</head><p>We are concerned that the trial datasets do not match the information in the CRF. In our review of four observations of data out of over one million in your medication error dataset, smed.xpt (used for most of your medication error analyses), we found an observation with a valid date in the CRF that was misrepresented by a period in the dataset, indicating that a valid date was missing. This error in the dataset has the possible effect of reducing the reported medication error rate since the observation was subsequently excluded from the count of medication errors because of the missing date in the dataset.</p><p>The raw dataset smed.xpt, containing information on drug dispensing, was used to create the analysis dataset, adinctrt.xpt. In smed.xpt the apixaban/placebo bottle verification date (variable name: smedd) for subject CV185030-1106-2032 contains a period(.), implying that the date was missing, invalid or partial. However, this subject's eCRF has an apixaban bottle verification date of "24OCT2008". Notably, the warfarin/placebo bottle medication return date is also "24OCT2008" in the eCRF, and it correctly appears in the dataset (variable name: smrtd). The SDTM dataset da.xpt (contains similar information as smed.xpt) is also incorrect since it appears that the Applicant used smed.xpt to create da.xpt. (reviewer's analysis: med_err\adinctrt check, sponsor's dataset smed, da) These dates are important because they were used to determine the subject's actual treatment in relation to the primary safety and efficacy endpoints. For this particular bottle, the Applicant removed it from the analysis dataset, adinctrt.xpt which was used for the majority of the medication error analyses.</p><p>The identified date problem, found with little effort, is worrisome because the primary analyses are time to event analyses. The Applicant should assure us that the datasets for these analyses are accurate and describe why they believe so. If their data cleaning processes were different for these datasets than they were for the medication error datasets, then they should apply similar processes to cleaning their medication error datasets. They should explain how their new process differs from that used for this NDA submission. There is certainly a concern that there may be other aspects of the datasets that do not match the CRF that the reviewer has not identified.</p></div>

Tissue distribution studies in rats showed that the GI tract (stomach, small intestine, large intestine, cecum), thyroid, urinary bladder, adrenal glands, liver and kidneys were exposed to the highest concentrations of apixaban. The brain, heart, and bone marrow were exposed to the lowest concentrations. Radioactivity was still present in the eyes at 168 hours after dosing. In contrast, radioactivity was last measureable in the blood and plasma at 24 hours post dose. The presence of radioactivity in the eye is noteworthy because the intraocular bleeding was higher on apixaban than on warfarin (see Sec <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7.3.2.1)</ref>. Elimination half-life estimates for apixaban-equivalents were less than 5 hours for adrenal glands, blood, plasma, and testes, but greater than 60 hours for the eyes, bone marrow and cecum.

There were transient effects on serum potassium. The NOAELS (no observable adverse effect level) correspond to exposure ratios of ~4 times (in rats) and 20-28 times (in dogs) the human exposure of unbound apixaban 5 mg BID.</p><p>Activated charcoal reduced the clearance of apixaban, with the largest effect at 3 hours after the dose in dogs. Hemodialysis (for 4 hours) had no effect on oral apixaban AUC 0-Acceptable animal studies indicate that apixaban and its metabolites are not carcinogenic, mutagenic, clastogenic, or genotoxic. In the carcinogenicity studies CD-1 male and female mice and Sprague Dawley rats did not have a statistically significant increase in tumors at exposure ratios of ~9, ~20, and 2-4 times, respectively, the human exposure dose of unbound apixaban 5 mg BID.</p><p>There were no drug-related effects on estrous cycling, mating or fertility in male or female rats; at the highest dose of 600 mg/kg body weight gain decreased slightly in male rats. The NOAEL doses were 200 mg/kg in males and 600 mg/kg in females, corresponding to exposure ratios that are 2.7 fold and 4.2 fold, respectively, the human exposure dose of 5 mg BID.</p><p>In an acceptable embryo-fetal development study in rats, the NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 1000 mg/kg/day because of a decrease in mean body weight gain and increased vaginal bleeding at 3000 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL corresponds to an exposure ratio of 4.2 times the human exposure dose of unbound apixaban 5 mg BID. A prenatal/postnatal development study in rats showed that dosing in the main study did not need to be interrupted during parturition. Bleeding and prolonged PTs were observed with 200 and 1000 mg/kg. There was no drug related mortality of F0 dams. At the NOAEL dosages of 200 and 1500 mg/kg, the exposure ratios were 4.9 and 5.4 times, respectively, the human exposure dose of unbound apixaban 5 mg BID.</p><p>Apixaban is excreted into the milk of rats primarily as apixaban. Concentrations of apixaban in milk were higher than concentrations in blood and plasma at all time points. Approximately 12 % of the maternal dose is excreted into the milk over a 24 hour period.</p><p>The main juvenile toxicology study in rats had a potential drug-related AE of an increased incidence of unilateral or bilateral degeneration of the testicular seminiferous tubules with 600 mg/kg/day in the Set 1 males that were necropsied at the end of dosing. The incidence of testicular degeneration was 33% (above the maximum of 26.7% in the historical control data). This finding appeared reversible in the recovery group; however the PT reviewer believes that this finding was drug related because of the severity of the testicular finding and the correlation with hypospermia in the epididymides.</p><p>The pharmacology/toxicology reviewer has the following recommendations: 1. Warn women of child-bearing potential of the high risks for bleeding during labor and delivery (there were no deaths during parturition in the pre/postnatal development study) 2. Conduct an additional juvenile animal study to determine if a critical period can be identified because of the severity of the testicular degeneration in the juvenile study. This should be done prior to any clinical pediatric studies. </p></div>

A telephonic IVRS system (available at all hours world-wide) was used for randomization, which was stratified by site and prior VKA status (naÃ¯ve or experienced). IVRS inputs included site no., patient name and number, age, prior VKA status, serum creatinine, and weight. VKA naÃ¯ve patients were defined as those who had not previously received warfarin or another VKA or had received â‰¤ 30 consecutive days of treatment with warfarin or another VKA in the past.. Other patients were defined as experienced. There was a target of at least 40% VKA naÃ¯ve patients at each site, which was enforced through the IVRS system. If the number of VKA-experienced patients was more than 60% of the number randomized at any site +2 patients, another VKA experienced patient could not be randomized by the IVRS system. This rule was implemented during the first year of enrollment and maintained until the end of enrollment.</p><p>In patients taking VKA at study entry, VKA therapy was discontinued prior to randomization. Randomization and study drug initiation occurred when the INR was &lt; 2.0.</p><p>A classic double dummy design was employed. Subjects in the apixaban arm received placebo for warfarin, and subjects in the warfarin arm received placebo for apixaban. Apixaban or matching placebo was provided as 2.5 or 5 mg plain red-brown oval tablets; the two strengths noticeably differed in size. Warfarin or matching placebo was supplied as 2 mg lavender round scored tablets only. However, as discussed in the comment below, this reviewer believes there was a blinding issue.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: We were provided with samples of study drug, including bottles of active and placebo for apixaban 5 mg and warfarin 2 mg. (We only received one bottle of apixaban 2.5 mg tablets, so no comparison between drug and placebo was possible) For apixaban 5 mg, the placebo tablets were somewhat thicker than the actives (3 people agreed). For warfarin the active tablets were slightly thicker than placebo (3 people agreed); the difference was not as marked as for apixaban 5 mg. We did not know if we would have gotten the same results with other bottles of tablets.</p><p>Following a discussion of this issue with the Applicant, we received a submission that downplayed the importance of the difference in thickness between the placebo and active 5 mg apixaban tablets, but acknowledged its existence. The Applicant argued that individual patients would be exposed only to active or placebo (assuming no dispensing errors at the site) and would ordinarily never have the opportunity to appreciate the difference. While that might be true, site personnel handled active drug and placebo tablets on a routine basis when subjects returned their unused tablets to be counted. difference in thickness of placebos vs. actives but it was within operating parameters of the Applicant's manufacturing process, and adequate care was taken to match the placebos with the corresponding active tablets."Because of this conclusion, and because we have no evidence that the differences in thickness between active and placebo tablets actually led to unblinding, we do not believe this is an issue of regulatory importance. The usual apixaban dose was 5 mg po twice daily. However, there was a dose modification, applicable only at the time of randomization, for risk factors for bleeding. Any person who had "any two" of the three defined risk factors for bleeding was randomized to apixaban (or matching placebo) at a dose of 2.5 mg po bid. The risk factors for bleeding were:</p><p>o Age â‰¥ 80 years o Body weight â‰¤ 60 kg o Serum creatinine â‰¥ 1.5 mg/dL Reviewer Comment: The Applicant has confirmed that "any two" risk factors was intended to mean any two or more risk factors.

At the FTP, subjects could be transitioned from study drug to an open-label VKA or other appropriate therapy. At the end of the post-treatment observation period, a follow-up visit occurred. For patients who completed the study on treatment, this was a telephonic visit and was planned as the last contact with the subject. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> (based on an Investigator Meeting slide) is a simple schematic of the trial plan. Note that some patients were in the trial for over 4 years.</p><p>All randomized subjects were to be followed until the study end trigger (the occurrence of 448 adjudicated primary endpoint events) and the subsequent procedures, even if they did not ever take study drug or prematurely discontinued study drug. Efforts were to be made to contact any subjects lost to follow-up and collect information on the occurrence of efficacy endpoint events and the reason for discontinuation.   Procedures were specified for discontinuation of study drug at the end of the study as well as for early discontinuation of study drug.</p><p>The final treatment visit (FTV) was to be scheduled as soon as possible and no later than five weeks after the end of treatment period date (EOTP date). The latter was the estimated date of attainment of the event target of 448 primary endpoint events, which was January 30, 2011. The FTV was the final in the double-blind treatment period for subjects on study drug at that time.</p><p>Investigators were encouraged, but not required, to transition patients to open-label anticoagulant therapy at the FTV and to use an apixaban bridging strategy (see Sec.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.3.1.5.4).</head><p>Following the FTV, visit there was to be a 30 day observation period to follow subjects after transition from study drug to open-label VKA or other appropriate therapy. In addition to ad hoc return visits to assess INR control (scheduled at the investigators' discretion), completing subjects had a telephonic "follow-up visit" approximately 30 days after the permanent discontinuation of study drug. For subjects who completed the scheduled double-blind treatment period, this was the final subject contact. Subjects who had prematurely discontinued study drug (or who were planning to discontinue) were to have the FTV, and if possible, continue taking study drug up to the FTV. At this visit, they were to be started on open-label VKA treatment or other appropriate therapy using the same procedures as those patients who completed the study, including visits for INR measurements. After the ESMDV, patients were to have a final in person site visit 30 days later. They were then followed up by phone every 12 weeks for the occurrence of efficacy endpoints until the EOTP date.</p><p>The following table summarizes planned study drug discontinuation and end of study procedures.

A retinal ischemic event (embolism, infarction) was to be considered a stroke. It was "strongly recommended" that a CT scan or MRI should be performed for all suspected strokes.

However, the site was not required to complete a bleeding event form.</p><p>Transient ischemic attack (TIA) was defined as a non-traumatic abrupt onset of a focal neurological deficit and lasting less than 24 hours in duration.</p><p>Stroke and TIA were to be further sub-classified based on whether or not there was imaging evidence of a new cerebral infarction that correlates with the clinical presentation of the subject.</p><p>Systemic embolism was defined as a clinical history consistent with an acute loss of blood flow to a peripheral artery (or arteries), which is supported by evidence of embolism from surgical specimens, autopsy, angiography, vascular imaging, or other objective testing.</p><p>Myocardial infarction (MI) had a complex definition that took into account clinical context: 2) For patients who had a recent myocardial infarction, an MI was defined by a) Elevation of CK-MB or Troponin T or I to â‰¥ 2 x ULN (if prior level was normal), or b) Re-elevation of CK-MB or Troponin T or I to â‰¥ 2 x ULN and &gt; 50% above the prior level (if prior level was above normal), or c) Re-elevation of total CK â‰¥ 2 x ULN and &gt; 25% above the prior level (if CK-MB is unavailable), or d) New, significant (â‰¥ 0.04 s) Q waves in â‰¥ 2 contiguous leads and discrete from the prior MI.</p><p>3) For patients who had undergone revascularization, an MI was defined by: a) Peri-PCI: CK-MB or Troponin T or I (or total CK, if CK-MB and Troponin is unavailable) â‰¥ 3 x ULN and increased by at least 50% from the level before the procedure or new significant (â‰¥ 0.04 s) Q waves in â‰¥ 2 contiguous ECG leads. b) Peri-CABG: CK-MB (or total CK, if CK-MB is unavailable) â‰¥ 10 x ULN and increased by at least 50% from the level before the procedure or CK-MB â‰¥ 5 x ULN and increased by at least 50% from level before the procedure with new significant (â‰¥ 0.04 s) Q waves in â‰¥ 2 contiguous ECG leads.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: "Recent" MI was not defined.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1.11.2">Ascertainment of events for adjudication</head><p>Events brought for adjudication were identified by review of specified data fields on the eCRF determined to be CEC-critical variables. These variables were described in a CEC "Triggers" document (see Attachment 5).</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The triggers for stroke included such items as completion of the "suspected stroke" endpoint CRF page or indication that a stroke or TIA had occurred between study visits on the "clinical event assessment" pages for each visit. However, the performance of a head CT or MI, without one of the other named triggers, would not have trigger referral for adjudication of stroke. Likewise, the performance of a leg angiogram, by itself, would not have triggered referral for adjudication of systemic embolism. Some studies have used such procedural triggers. However, it seems likely that omission of referrals on this basis would be rare because it is very likely that patients with a suspected stroke or SE would have some trigger besides the procedural trigger. Also, there is no evidence that that such missed referrals, if they exist at all, would be biased in favor of apixaban.</p><p>Once all eCRF data fields necessary for CEC review were query-clean, the case was ready for adjudication. It was the responsibility of the Coordinator to ensure that records were complete enough for adjudication.</p><p>In addition, the CEC could adjudicate events ("CEC identified events") that it discovered during its review of events identified by the computer program.</p><p>Both pages from the CRF and source documents were typically reviewed for each type of event.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1.11.3">Adjudication procedures</head><p>Adjudication off all events of the previously named classes that occurred after randomization was performed in "phases". Phase I adjudication for deaths and MIs involved adjudication by one physician (always a cardiologist in the case of Mis). These cases were resolved in Phase I. For stroke, systemic emboli, and bleeding events, Phase I involved two independent physicians, at least one of which was a neurologist for stroke cases. If the two agreed, the case was resolved. If not, the case went to Phase II. Phase II reviews were performed by a committee of at least 3 physicians which operated by consensus. For stroke cases, there was at least one neurologist. However, stroke and systemic embolic events occurring within one month of randomization went directly to Phase II.</p><p>A random sample of events underwent QC review by the CEC Phase II committee.</p><p>Reviewer comment: These processes seem adequate on their face. While it might have been preferable to adjudicate all hospitalizations, to find efficacy and safety events, the algorithms used in ARISTOTLE appear to be unbiased and sufficiently inclusive.</p><p>However, of the adjudication "packages" provided to us for stroke adjudications that were reviewed by the efficacy reviewer had evidence of review by only one physician, and no notes were provided regarding the reasoning underlying the final adjudication. We understand that single document represents the final signoff. It would have been helpful to have the individual adjudication documents and the rationale for the final decision. For the US, the primary endpoint analysis was based on scenario A described in the previous section: a NI margin of 1.38 for the 95% CI of the RR (apixaban vs. warfarin) for the primary endpoint analysis of time to first event. This was calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model with treatment arm as a covariate, with stratification by investigative site (pooled at the geographic region level) and prior VKA status (experienced or naÃ¯ve). A sensitivity Cox model analysis was performed that was stratified by investigative site and prior VKA status, with covariates of treatment arm, history of stroke, TIA or non-systemic embolus, history of DM, treatment for hypertension, history of MI, and history of "coronary heart failure."</p><p>There were various analyses of efficacy result in the "Evaluable" (per protocol) patient population, using event windows starting with the first dose of study drug and ending 2, 7, or 30 days after the last dose of study drug. The Evaluable population excluded randomized patients who were not dosed or who had or protocol violations that might have affected the outcome of the primary endpoint, including:</p><p>â€¢ Compliance with apixaban/apixaban placebo &lt; 80%</p><p>â€¢ Error in treatment assignment resulting in a subject being dosed with an incorrect treatment</p><p>In the case of an error or errors in treatment assignment, the patient was censored at the time of the first such error for analyses of the Evaluable patient population.</p><p>Using the same methods as the primary analysis, a series of secondary endpoints would be analyzed. These included:</p><p>â€¢ ischemic stroke or stroke of unspecified type There were two versions of the statistical plan. Dates of these plans, along with major study milestones, are provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 17</ref>. --Version 1.0 of the SAP was completed more than 8 months after the first study patient was randomized.</p><p>Version 2.0, the final version, was completed almost 3 Â½ years after the first patient was randomized, and about two months prior to the only interim analysis. Although there were many changes between Ver. 10 and 2.0, there were few changes with more than a trivial likelihood of affecting approval or labeling. These included:</p><p>â€¢ Addition of a justification for the sample size increase effected by Protocol amendment 7, which increased sample size from 15,000 to 18,000 to account for the unexpectedly low overall event rate for the primary endpoint. â€¢ Clarification of the definition of the treatment period.</p><p>â€¢ Changes in the testing strategy to address comments from FDA.</p><p>â€¢ Changes in provisions for handling stratification by site in the Cox proportional model analysis of the primary endpoint: sites were to be pooled at the level of Geographic Region. â€¢ Addition of BMI, weight, level of renal impairment, and CHADS 2 score as baseline subgroups of clinical relevance that will be summarized. â€¢ Adopted Rosendaal method for INR imputation.</p><p>â€¢ Added last dose + 2 day analysis for per protocol analysis of NI.</p><p>â€¢ Added formal testing for superiority for major bleeding and all-cause death.</p><p>â€¢ Specified analysis period for each laboratory value analysis.</p><p>â€¢ Aligned interim analysis stopping rule with stopping rule developed by DMC (prior to the DMC examining any data). Reviewer Comment: The SAP was changed to add formal testing for superiority for major bleeding and all-cause death after the trial was fully enrolled with 18,000 patients. These analyses were both successful and each is cited by the Applicant to provide support for a label claim. The timing of this SAP amendment should be considered in the evaluation of the relevant label claims.</p></div>

Reviewer Comment: The late changes in the analysis plan (Amendment 10) to add superiority for major bleeding and all-cause death to the hierarchical analysis plan is problematic, as the study was fully enrolled and much data had been generated and passed along to the contractor preparing data for the IDSMB. The timing of this protocol amendment should be considered in our deliberations regarding potential label claims based on the last two superiority analyses in the hierarchical analysis plan (ISTH major bleeding and all-cause mortality).</p></div>

Each arm had a mean age of 70 years, with 32% and 35% with age â‰¥ 75 years in the apixaban and aspirin arms, respectively. Women comprised 41% and 42% of the apixaban and aspirin arms, respectively. Race was comparable in the two arms: 79% and 78% of patients were classified as white in the apixaban and aspirin arms, respectively, and 19% in each arm were Asian. Mean weight was 79 kg and mean BMI was 28 in each arm. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 20</ref> is a display of relevant medical history at baseline in the treatment arms. There were no notable differences.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 21</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 22</ref> provide information on baseline renal function and CHADS2 score, respectively. Both tables show similarity between the groups. Notably, more than 60% of patients in each arm had a CHADS2 score of at least 2, making them potential candidates for warfarin therapy. About 38% in each arm had a CHADS2 score of exactly 1, which by the consensus guidelines for the management of AFib, made them candidates for either aspirin or warfarin.  There were 182 (6.5%) and 184 (6.6%) subjects in the apixaban and aspirin arms, respectively, who were candidates for the reduced (2.5 mg bid) dose of apixaban/placebo because they met at least two of the relevant criteria (age â‰¥80 years, weight â‰¤60 kg or serum creatinine â‰¥1.5 mg/mL) for increased bleeding risk. Six and 4 subjects in the apixaban and aspirin arms, respectively had all three risks; the remainder of candidates for the lower dose (176 and 180 respectively) had 2 risks.</p><p>The treatment arms were also similar with respect to the reasons why VKA therapy was deemed to be unsuitable for the patient. For about 40% of patients in each arm, VKA therapy had been demonstrated to be unsuitable. For the remainder, it was expected to be unsuitable.</p><p>For patients with prior VKA use, the most common reason for unsuitability was "unable to maintain VKA in therapeutic range (about 16.5% in each arm). Only about 3% in each arm had "significant bleeding while on Coumadin " as the reason for unsuitability.</p><p>"Subject refused treatment" was only the reason for unsuitability in 15% and 14% of patients in the apixaban and aspirin arms, respectively. "CHADS 2 score =1 and physician does not recommend VKA use" was the only reason for unsuitability in about 11% of patients in each arm.</p></div>

Death and non-fatal AEs in general (including stroke, SE, and bleeding) were less commonly associated with withdrawal from treatment in the apixaban arm, while MI (10 vs. 6 subjects) was more common in the apixaban arm. Of note, "other" as a cause for withdrawal was more common in the apixaban arm (4.7% vs. 3.7%).</p><p>Note that AVERROES had a long-term open label extension (LTOLE) that is ongoing.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 24</ref>, Subject Disposition, indicates that in general, follow-up during the treatment phase was good in this study, with a low lost-to-follow-up rate during treatment (â‰¤0.3% in each arm). However, 23% and 22% of subject in the apixaban and aspirin arms, entered the follow-up phase (i.e., they stopped treatment) but did not enter the LTOLE or complete follow-up for some reason that was not provided. However the Applicant notes that "many" of these subjects failed to enter the LTOLEs due to delays in approval of the protocol amendment that provided for the LTOLE at IRBs or regulatory authorities.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 25</ref> is a display of the number of subjects in the various study populations used in the efficacy analyses described under the next heading. 112 apixaban over aspirin is due prevention of ischemic/unspecified stroke, but there is an a beneficial effect of the rate of SE as well. Both vascular and non-vascular death were numerically reduced by apixaban compared to aspirin. Hemorrhagic stroke rates were low and similar.

The study DSMB did request analyses of strokes prevented "according to Rankin scores at various cut points." Nonetheless, these analyses represent post-hoc looks at the data. Reviewer comment: The results of AVERROES provide no direct information about the comparison of apixaban to warfarin, which is the critical comparison with respect to approval. However, if apixaban is approved key results from AVERROES, including results in the subset of low risk patients, should be included in apixaban labeling in Sec.14 to permit promotional claims of superiority to aspirin in stroke/SE prevention to encourage physicians to use this more effective product as an alternative to aspirin.</p><p>For a discussion of primary efficacy endpoint events that occurred after the last dose of study drug in AVERROES, see Sec. 6.1.10.2.2.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Summary</head><p>The primary support for the proposed indication is the warfarin-controlled ARISTOTLE trial. In addition, the Applicant conducted the aspirin-controlled AVERROES trial in patients who had failed or were considered likely to be unsuitable for VKA treatment.</p><p>Because warfarin has been convincingly demonstrated to be a superior to antiplatelet agents (including aspirin alone or in combination with clopidogrel) 1;8 in preventing thrombotic events in patients with nonvalvular AFib, the AVERROES trail should be considered as merely supportive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARISTOTLE primary endpoint results:</head><p>ARISTOTLE was a large (&gt;18,000 subjects), randomized, double blind (double dummy), event-driven, warfarin-controlled, non-inferiority trial in adults with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AFib) or atrial flutter (AFl) with at least one additional risk factor for thrombotic events. The dose of apixaban was 5 mg po twice daily (2.5 mg twice daily for those with pre-specified risk factors for bleeding); warfarin was to be titrated to a target INR range of 2.0 to 3.0. The primary endpoint was time to a composite of stroke and systemic embolism (SE). The Applicant's designated primary endpoint analysis was for non-inferiority (with a margin of 1.38 for the HR) in the ITT (all randomized patient) population. This analysis included events occurring during the "intended treatment period" (ITP), which extended from each patient's date of randomization to January 30, 2011, the estimated date of attainment of the event target of 448 primary endpoint events. This analysis will be referred to as the "ITT/ITP" analysis. As the initial analysis in a 4-step hierarchical analysis plan, it was used to evaluate (1) noninferiority to and then (2) superiority to warfarin if non-inferiority was achieved. Steps 3 and 4 in the hierarchy are discussed below. The ITT/ITP analysis of the primary endpoint yielded a hazard ratio (apixaban vs. warfarin) of 0.79, with a 95% CI of 0.66 to 0.95, p (superiority) = 0.0114, thus supporting both non-inferiority and superiority. However, if the standard for a superiority claim based on a single study is a p â‰¤ 0.01, one could arguably deny a superiority claim. Additional analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint included ones of "evaluable" patients (i.e., the per-protocol population), Clinical Review: Nhi Beasley and Martin Rose Application type: Priority, NDA 202155 ELIQUIS (apixaban) 115 counting events occurring during the on-treatment period (first dose of study drug to last dose + 2 days), and two other analyses based on the on-treatment period but with event windows extending to 7 or 30 days after the last dose of study drug. All these analyses of the primary endpoint results supported superiority of apixaban to warfarin, with p values ranging from 0.011 in the worst case (the ITT/ITP analysis) to &lt; 0.001in the best case (for both the on-treatment and last dose + 7 days analyses in the perprotocol population). Additional analyses of the primary endpoint in all treated patients were likewise supportive of superiority.</p><p>These efficacy findings appeared to be preserved across major subgroups of patients in the ITT/ITP analysis, including each gender, the elderly, subjects previously treated with a VKA, subjects with a prior history of stroke, TIA or systemic embolism, subjects in each of the 4 specified geographic regions, those who qualified for the lower dose, and those enrolled from US sites.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary endpoints</head><p>The primary endpoint findings were also supported by numerical imbalances for most important secondary efficacy endpoints that favored apixaban over warfarin in the ITT/ITP analysis. These endpoints included the rates of strokes (all types combined), hemorrhagic strokes, fatal strokes, systemic emboli, vascular deaths, and non-vascular deaths. The results for myocardial infarction also favored apixaban, unlike in the RE-LY trial of dabigatran. The results for death also support the primary endpoint findings, and are discussed below.</p><p>There was a small imbalance of pure ischemic strokes in favor of warfarin in the ITT population during the ITP (140 vs. 136 events occurring during the ITP). However, when ischemic strokes with hemorrhagic conversion are also included, the results favored apixaban (152 vs. 156), and the additional inclusion of strokes of uncertain type also favored apixaban (166 vs. 177 for the combined categories). There were few systemic emboli and the difference in rate between the treatment arms was small. Thus the primary endpoint results favoring apixaban were driven mostly by an excess of hemorrhagic strokes in the warfarin arm (40 vs. 78). While all strokes were counted as efficacy events, hemorrhagic stroke is a risk of anticoagulation, not something that is prevented by anticoagulation. Thus, if apixaban is superior to warfarin in terms of stroke, it is superior because it causes less hemorrhagic stroke than warfarin. There is a modest (non-significant) difference between apixaban and warfarin in terms of reducing the rate of ischemic stroke, the primary reason for giving anticoagulants to patients with atrial fibrillation.</p><p>In the pre-specified, 4-step hierarchical analysis plan, step 3 was a superiority analysis for time to ISTH major bleeding, the primary safety endpoint, in the safety population on treatment. This analysis was robustly successful and is discussed further in the safety summary.</p><p>Step 4 in the hierarchy was an analysis of superiority of apixaban for time to all-cause death, conducted in a manner similar to that of the primary endpoint ITT/ITP Clinical Review: Nhi Beasley and Martin Rose Application type: Priority, NDA 202155 ELIQUIS (apixaban) 116 analysis. This was just barely successful: the HR was 0.89, with a 95% CI of 0.80 to 1.00 (p=0.0465). Hazard ratios for CV death and non-CV death differed little from each other and from the all-cause death HR.</p><p>The following issues are relevant to the interpretation of the efficacy results of the trial:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Medication errors and other trial conduct issues in ARISTOTLE:</head><p>The clinical reviewers are concerned that study medication errors and deficiencies in monitoring and the data quality assurance process may have affected outcomes in ARISTOTLE. This complex issue is summarized in Sec. 1 above and described in depth in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.</ref> , there is explicit language in Sec. 14 of the Applicant's proposed PI regarding superiority to warfarin.</p><p>The primary support for is the just-barely significant reduction in time to allcause death in the ITT/ITP analysis (HR=0.89, 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.00, p=0.0465). This analysis is part of a hierarchy that conserves overall alpha error at the 0.05 level. However, one additional death in the apixaban arm or one fewer death in the warfarin would negate the statistical significance of this finding. An analysis with a variable cutoff date that includes a 30 day follow-up period for treated patients after the last dose of study drug (rather than the ITT/ITP analysis, in which all completing patients (about 75% of the total) were still on treatment at the analysis cutoff date) was slightly less favorable for apixaban, with p = 0.08 an upper limit of the HR of 1.01.</p><p>In addition, 590 patients (3.2% of those randomized) discontinued follow-up alive during the study and had no information on vital status at the cut-off date for the ITT/ITP analysis of death; they were censored on the date of their last contact prior to the cut-off date. As discussed in Sec. 3, there were systemic blinding issues in this study that might have lead to unblinding of individuals or all patients at a site. If such unblinding occurred (we don't know how often that happened), a site might have made lesser efforts to track the vital status for some patients than for others, thus potentially biasing the mortality results. Note that only one additional death in the apixaban arm (or one fewer in the warfarin arm) might have negated the superiority finding for all-cause death in the ITT/ITP analysis.</p><p>Also, the results of analyses based on site-specific INR control in the warfarin arm suggest that unlike the primary endpoint results, better INR control was associated with less favorable results for apixaban for all cause death. The Applicant's analyses show</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">Reference ID: 3134464 (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4)</formula><p>Clinical Review: Nhi Beasley and Martin Rose Application type: Priority, NDA 202155 ELIQUIS (apixaban) 118 of warfarin, and the constancy assumption is satisfied for ARISTOTLE (see Sec.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6.1.10.1).</head><p>Quality of INR control in the warfarin arm in ARISTOTLE was in between that obtained in the ROCKET study of rivaroxaban (another study satisfying the constancy assumption with respect to use of warfarin) and the better results obtained in RE-LY, but was closer to RE-LY than to ROCKET in this regard. Thus, anticoagulation in ARISTOTLE was good enough so that the overall findings of non-inferiority or superiority to warfarin should not be rejected due to inadequate dosing in the control arm. However, for subjects at sites with TTR above the median subjects, and in the best quartile of TTR, results for all-cause death suggest lack of superiority over warfarin, which might be a labeling issue (see text above and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Sec. 6.1.10.1.3)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy events occurring after discontinuation of study drug in completers:</head><p>Approximately 3/4 of patients in ARISTOTLE in each arm continued taking study drug until the end of this event-driven study. In these patients, blinded study medication was stopped, and the investigator was to transition patients to alternative anticoagulant therapy, usually a vitamin K antagonist such as warfarin. Like in several other recent trials of novel anticoagulants in AFib patients (the Sportif V trial of ximelagatran and the RE-LY trial of dabigatran), investigators were urged to implement a short period of dual therapy with study drug and open-label warfarin (which was to continue long-term) for patients in the apixaban arm to continue effective anticoagulation during the lag period of INR control at the start of warfarin therapy. In ARISTOTLE, this was done using blinded apixaban study drug, which was to be administered for four additional (twicedaily) doses. Blinding of study drug was maintained, so that warfarin arm patients received placebo for their transition medicine. About 60% of completing subjects in each arm received this transition regimen; about 84% received a VKA during the 30 days after the end of the double blind treatment period.</p><p>However, as in the ROCKET study of rivaroxaban, in the 30 days after the last dose of blinded study drug, there were significantly more primary endpoint events (mostly ischemic strokes) in the apixaban than in the warfarin arm, with a HR of about 4 (21 vs 5 events). Events were distributed throughout the 30 day period. In the apixaban arm, there were 3 hemorrhagic strokes, all in patient who received open-label VKA treatment, and all occurring in the second half of the 30 day post-dose period. These events were probably related to warfarin use. Unfortunately, INR information during this period was not routinely collected, and was absent for the vast majority of subjects. However, less than 50% of subjects were receiving a VKA at the start of the study, and it is seems reasonable to believe that INR control was suboptimal following the end of the study in many subjects.</p><p>There was an analogous finding (a significantly increased rate of stroke/SE in the 30 days after the last dose of study drug in the apixaban arm compared to the warfarin arm) in completing patients in AVERROES, the aspirin controlled study of apixaban in Unlike ROCKET and RE-LY, ARISTOTLE allowed patients with atrial flutter (AFl) to enter the study as well as those with AFib. In addition, patients without either of these arrhythmia at entry could be randomized with a demonstrated history of either AFib or AFl (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Sec 5.3.1.4)</ref>. The consensus guidelines on the management of patients with AFib states that patients with AFl should receive anticoagulant therapy like those with AFib (level of evidence: C). 3 <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 33</ref> provides information on heart rhythm at the baseline ECG as well as other study visits during the trial for convenience. The study arms were well balanced with regard to rhythm; only the overall data are shown.</p><p>About 81% of subjects has AFib at baseline, while 4% had AFl. Thus, 15% had neither AFib nor AFl at baseline, and about 13% were in sinus rhythm at baseline.</p><p>About 88% had at least one study visit ECG with AFib; 7% had at least one ECG with AFl. About 70% had AFib on all study ECGs. Only 1% had AFl on all ECGs, consistent with the generally unstable nature of AFl. About 10% of subjects had not a single study ECG with either AFib or AFl, suggesting that these subjects might have been be at lower risk of thromboembolism than others.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The last finding described above may not affect our acceptance of positive study results. To the extent that patients did not have an atrial arrhythmia that predisposed them to thrombotic events during the study, it would be more difficult to show superiority of one antithrombotic over another, although it might be easier to show non-inferiority. Thus, if superiority is shown, the fact that 10% of patients may not have been at increased risk for thrombotic events is not problematic in interpreting the study results.  shows vital status at "end of study," using all information available before database lock, including from death registries and contacts with a subject's family. It is my understanding from conversations with Applicant representatives that if the last known "contact" (information from any source) indicated a patient was alive, the patient would be classified as alive, even if the contact occurred before the end of the ITP. Note that 656 and 718 subjects in the apixaban and warfarin arms, respectively were known to be dead; 180 and 200 subjects, respectively, had unknown vital status.</p><p>We requested analogous information for vital status at the end of the ITP to help us interpret the Applicant's the requested data are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 37</ref>. Compared to Table 36, in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 37</ref> there are fewer known deaths in the apixaban arm (656 and 603, respectively), and considerably more subjects with unknown vital status (180 and 288, respectively). Data for the warfarin arm show the same pattern, with slightly more deaths Reviewer Comment: The fact that that there are more warfarin patients than apixaban arm patients with unknown vital status subjects at the end of the ITP is somewhat reassuring. However, possible unblinding may have affected the diligence of site staff in seeking out vital status information on some subjects who discontinued follow-up. This issue is discussed further in Sec. <ref type="bibr">1</ref>    <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 38</ref> provides information on subjects who discontinued study drug prior to the end of the ITP. There were fewer such subjects, 2310 (25.3%) vs.2493 (27.5%), in the apixaban arm compared to the warfarin arm. Bleeding was the most common reason for discontinuation other than death.  Patients were excluded from the evaluable population for the following reasons:</p><p>1. They received no study treatment 2. They received the wrong study treatment at first visit. 3. Study drug compliance was less than 80%.</p><p>A patient who received the correct study drug initially and then was given the wrong study drug (through an error at the site) was included in the evaluable population but was censored on the day that the wrong drug was first dispensed. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.4">Analysis of Primary Endpoint</head><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of stroke (ischemic, hemorrhagic or of unknown type) or non-CNS systemic embolism. The primary efficacy analysis was the  Treated Population, although, as one might expect, the hazard ratios are more favorable to apixaban than those for the Safety Population. FDA performed an analysis of how many additional primary endpoint events would be required in the apixaban arm to negate the findings of non-inferiority and superiority in the Applicant's primary efficacy analysis. The analysis was done using two different methods. The first method calculated odds ratios for the number of events, without taking time into effect. Events were simply added to the apixaban arm results or subtracted from the warfarin arm results (but not both in the same analysis), an exact test was used to calculate statistical significance. The second used the hazard ratios for time to event. For adjustments to in the apixaban arm results , one day was subtracted (if possible) from the time to event for patients with the shortest time to event, one at a time. For adjustments to the warfarin arm results, one day was added to the time to event for patients with the shortest time to event, one patient at a time.</p><p>The results are displayed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 45</ref>. The non-inferiority result are quite robust: using the odds ratio approach, it would require 98 additional events in the apixaban arm or 78 fewer events in the warfarin arm to negate the finding of non-inferiority with a margin of 1.38. Using the hazard ratio approach, the non-inferiority results are even more robust. The superiority findings are considerably less robust. Using either approach, it would take 12 additional events in the apixaban arm or 13 fewer event in the warfarin arm to negate superiority.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 46</ref> is a display of event rates, hazard ratios, and p-values (superiority) in the ITT population during the Intended Treatment Period for secondary endpoint data, including the components of the primary endpoint, various categories of stroke, all-cause death and several categories of cause-specific death, and myocardial infarction.</p><p>All-cause death was the fourth step in hierarchical analysis plan. The first 3 steps in the hierarchy (1, non-inferiority for the primary efficacy endpoint in the ITT population during the intended treatment period; 2, superiority for the primary efficacy endpoint in the ITT population during the intended treatment period; and 3, superiority for the primary safety endpoint (ISTH major bleeding) in the Treated Population during the treatment period), all met their respective, prespecified criteria for statistical significance (see Sec. 7 for a discussion of bleeding). Thus, observed significant finding for superiority of apixaban for all-cause mortality . However, nominal success of any analysis in the hierarchy means that there is no increase in alpha error inherent in moving down to the next analysis in the hierarchy. It does not necessarily imply regulatory recognition of the finding for the purposes of labeling.  Unlike the primary endpoint analyses, where the last dose +2 days and last dose +7 days analyses were both more favorable for apixaban than the ITT analysis, here all 3 analyses off all-cause death in the treated population failed to show a significant difference between apixaban and placebo and were less favorable (i.e., had a higher p value) than the ITT analysis of death.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: These results tend to disfavor a claim of superiority of apixaban over warfarin, but they could be viewed as supporting a claims of non-inferiority to warfarin in terms of death (using a NI of 1.015) if one accepts the death finding in the Hart meta-analysis. </p></div>

Results for these endpoints are displayed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 49</ref>. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the number of additional events in the apixaban arm or fewer event in the warfarin arm would be to negate the finding of superiority for all-cause mortality, which on its face would appear to be quite fragile. The methodology described in connection with the sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint results (see the paragraph immediately above <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 45</ref> for details) was used. Using the odds ratio approach, which does not take time into account, either two more events in the apixaban arm or two fewer events in the warfarin arm would negate superiority. Using the hazard ratio approach, which takes time into account, only one more event in the apixaban arm or one fewer event in the warfarin arm would be required to negate superiority (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 48</ref>).</p><p>This result is not surprising given that the upper limit of the hazard ratio for all-cause death is 1.00. As noted in Sec.3, there were issues regarding integrity of the study blind which may have affected event ascertainment, and there were GCP issue at a site 1200 in China, where there were 3 deaths in the warfarin arm, compared to 2 deaths in the apixaban arm. If, for example, Site 1200 were eliminated from the analysis, statistical significance for superiority for all-cause death probably would be lost. There are also ongoing analyses of medication errors that might have affected study outcomes (Sec.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.1.1).</head><p>There are additional reasons for and against accepting the Applicant's proposed language indicating that apixaban is superior to warfarin for all-cause death. The reasons in favor of apixaban include:</p><p>1) The ITT analysis, usually considered the most conservative, supports superiority 2) On treatment analyses in the safety population and per protocol population support superiority 3) There were significantly fewer strokes (including significantly disabling and fatal strokes) in the apixaban arm. One would expect a drug that reduced stroke risk to show an effect on all cause death. 4) The results of AVERROES (which was terminated early because of superiority of apixaban for stroke/SE prevention) show a strong trend in favor of apixaban for all-cause death vs. aspirin, which ought be at least as good as placebo.</p><p>Reasons against accepting the Applicant's proposed language include: 5) There were 590 patients who left the study early and had unknown vital status at the end of the ITP. Such patients were censored at the last known contact prior to the end of the ITP, when they were known to be alive. If ascertainment of vital status was affected by unblinding (i.e., less effort was made to uncover the vital status of apixaban arm patients), the results could be biased. However, there is no evidence that any such bias occurred. 6) The effect of apixaban on all-cause death is most apparent at sites below the median TTR. At sites above the median, the HR &gt; 0.9, and is 1.2 in the Applicant's analysis of the best quartile of TTR <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">(Table 68</ref>) and is 1.0 in FDA's analysis of the best quartile of TTR ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 69</ref>). Note that this objection is most relevant to the comparative claim, not an absolute claim of reduction in all-cause death.</p><p>Also, if one accepts that warfarin prevents death, one might show that apixaban is NI to warfarin even of not superior. Then might be appropriate, even though a comparative claim would not. There are several problems with this approach:</p><p>1) The Hart meta-analysis showing the benefit of warfarin on all cause death has not been vetted by FDA, although such vetting could be undertaken. 2) Even if one accepts the results of the Hart meta-analysis, the resulting NI margin of 1.015 is so close to 1.0 that nearly any analysis that fails to support superiority would also fail to support non-inferiority.</p></div>

Note that ECGs were obtained at screening, yearly during treatment, and at the final visit. Study patients included those with a screening ECG showing AFib or atrial flutter (AFl), and also those with either rhythm documented on 2 occasions at least 2 weeks apart in the 12 months prior to enrollment. The data indicate that while about 4% of subjects had AFl at screening and 7% had AFl on at least one study ECG, only 1% of subjects had this rhythm on all study ECGs, consistent with usual description of AFl as an unstable rhythm. There were too few events in patients in any of the AFl subgroups mentioned above to determine whether apixaban therapy was beneficial compared to warfarin, although hazard ratios favor apixaban in each of the 3 AFl subgroups. Patients with neither AFib nor AFl at screening and those with neither rhythm on any study ECG were not uncommon in this study (about 15% of the total for the former subgroup and 10% for the latter). Both subgroups had low event rates in each arm (about 1 event per 100 pt-years) and hazard ratios near 1.</p><p>On the other hand, each of the AFib subgroups (those with AFib at screening, on any ECG, and on all study ECGs) had fairly similar event rates in the apixaban arm, and similar (but higher) event rates in the warfarin arm, with hazard ratios very close to the overall study HR of 0.79.

However, the evidence that apixaban was superior to warfarin for prevention of primary endpoint events in the overall ITT/ITP analysis, on treatment, and in the subsets of patients with AFib at some time or all times during the study is reassuring that apixaban does have a beneficial effect in AFib patients.  The number of patients who were randomized to 2.5 mg apixaban was small, but the data suggest that the benefit of apixaban for the prevention of stroke/SE was maintained in that subgroup.</p></div>

The primary efficacy endpoint was the rate of the composite of stroke and systemic embolism and the primary safety endpoint was the rate of the composite of ISTH major bleeds and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events. Efficacy and safety endpoints were assessed during study treatment.</p><p>Notably, this study was started after ARISTOTLE and AVERROES had begun and was not relied upon for choice of dose in the Phase 3 program.</p><p>A total of 22 subjects were randomized into each arm, and all but 4 were treated. Patients in each arm were similar at baseline (data not shown). Results for efficacy and safety are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 60</ref>. In this small and short-duration study, there were no strokes, SEs, deaths, or Mis in either the apixaban 2.5 mg bid or 5 mg bid arm. Each apixaban arm had one CRNM bleed. The higher dose had a higher rate of overall bleeding.

The rationale for this dose was not based on explicit exposure matching criteria. However, in the AVERROES study report (sec. 3.4.4) the Applicant indicates that results of the influence of intrinsic factors such as age, weight, and renal function indicated that patients with combinations of these factors could result in greater exposure. Thus, for patients at higher risk of bleeding ("e.g., an elderly subject with small stature or renal impairment"), a lower dose of apixaban was selected.</p><p>As noted in the primary endpoint analysis in patients receiving the lower dose <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">(Table  54</ref>) and the analysis of bleeding data in this subgroup <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">(Table 94)</ref>, the ARISTOTLE data support the use of this reduced dose.

Use of site-level data preserves the effects of randomization and is less prone to bias than simply comparing all patients in the apixaban arm to those with various levels of TTR in the warfarin arm. The latter type of comparison could be greatly confounded by the effects of nationality, region, demography, and general quality of care, which could differ greatly in patients with poor vs. good warfarin control.</p><p>The Applicant performed an analysis of the primary endpoint results in quartiles of sitebased TTR, as well as above and below the median TTR.   162 quartile, the spread in values from lowest to highest is 0.45. FDA's analysis shows a similar pattern as the Applicant's analysis with respect to the relationship between event rates and TTR, except that the results in the 3 rd and 4 th quartiles are not notably different from each other. However, the HR values among the 4 quartiles in FDA's analysis vary much less than in the Applicant's analysis-no quartile has a HR markedly different from the overall HR of 0.79, and the spread from lowest to highest HR is 0.10.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: FDA's analysis suggests that the HR for the primary endpoint favors apixaban in a reasonably consistent across a broad range of warfarin control, including quite good control in the 4 th quartile (site TTR &gt; 72.7%).</p><p>The Applicant also provided primary endpoint results in quartiles of site based time below therapeutic range (TBTR) in the warfarin arm. k TTR does not distinguish between out of range high values of INR and out of range low values of INR. The former are associated with a rate of hemorrhagic stroke that increases slowly as INR rises above 3, with little change in the rate of ischemic stroke. The latter are associated with a steeply increasing rate of ischemic stroke (which is more common than hemorrhagic stroke in the therapeutic range) with little change in the rate of hemorrhagic stroke. Thus, a metric that focuses on out of range low values of INR might result in a larger spread of warfarin arm event rates that one that treats high and low values, and possibly a larger spread in hazard ratios among the quartiles. .</p><p>FDA also analyzed the primary endpoint results by site TBTR. Again, the quartiles varied less in size in the FDA analysis. The FDA analysis is shown below in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 67</ref>. Note that the best warfarin control is represented in the first quartile and the worst control is represented in the fourth quartile. Event rates both arms tend to increase as TBTR increases; this relationship is stronger in the warfarin arm than in the apixaban arm. However, there is no clear relationship between TBTR and the HR.</p><p>k We hypothesized that quartiles or other subsets based on this parameter might better distinguish centers in terms of primary event rates than a conventional TTR analysis. The underlying rationale is based on the fact that most primary endpoint events are ischemic strokes. The risk of ischemic stroke increases sharply as INR falls below 2. On the other hand, ischemic stroke risk is little affected by INR &gt; 3 compared to INR in the therapeutic range of 2 -3. The risk of hemorrhagic stroke does increase as INR increases over 3, but the rate of increase is modest, and such strokes are decidedly less common than ischemic strokes in studies in atrial fibrillation patients. Accordingly, while INRs above the therapeutic range count against TTR as it is usually measured, they have only modest effects on primary endpoint rates. This would tend to blunt the power of a primary endpoint analysis that takes into account such INRs to distinguish between subsets based on INR control. Accordingly an analysis that considers only time below the therapeutic range might better distinguish among subgroups of centers with different levels of INR control. However, INRs above therapeutic range would be relevant in an analysis of bleeding risk, and the conventional TTR analysis (or an analysis that considers only time above range) would be expected to be useful in assessing the affects of differences in INR control on bleeding events.  To further examine the relationship between control of INR and efficacy, we asked the Applicant to create a graphical analysis of the primary endpoint (ITT, ITP) in which the x axis is site TTR ranging from 0% to 100% and the y axis is the HR for apixaban vs. warfarin (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 12)</ref>. The figure is a plot of Y=f(x) where f(x) is the point estimate for the HR for primary endpoint for apixaban vs. warfarin at all centers where TTR was in the interval from x to 100%. Thus, for x=0%, the HR corresponded to the HR for the entire study, and for x=K%, the HR was the HR for the centers with TTR ranging from K% to 100%. As K increases, the number of patients in the analysis decreases, and the CI becomes wider. We also plotted the 5 th and 95 th percentile for the HR. Note that the HR point estimate curve (the center curve) is fairly flat from X=0% to about X&gt;~75% and goes up slightly. It approaches1.0 only when top several percent of patients at the sites with highest TTR are included in the analysis.</p><p>between TTR and various outcomes (i.e., the decrease in risk of an event associated with a 1 SD increase in TTR) was greater for all-cause mortality than for stroke, bleeding, or hospital admission. </p></div>

Apixaban arm patients may be been at greater risk than those in the warfarin arm because of the short halflife of apixaban's PD effect compared to warfarin, which could have increased the degree and duration of inadequate anticoagulation in the apixaban arm. <ref type="bibr">6</ref>.1.10.2.1.1 Comparisons of "VKA naÃ¯ve" patients at the start and after the end of double blind treatment ARISTOTLE study patients who entered the study VKA naÃ¯ve and were randomized into the warfarin arm may be similar in terms of their risk of thrombotic events to apixaban arm patients who completed the study and then started warfarin treatment, since both subgroups of patients were started on warfarin during the study after extended period of time without warfarin treatment.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.10.2.5">Summary of Data Regarding Post-treatment Events</head><p>As noted above, there was an elevated rate of stroke in apixaban arm patients compared to during the 30 days after the last dose of study drug control in both of the Applicant's Phase 3 AFib trials in patients who completed the studies. While the data from ARISTOTLE suggest that poor INR control in patients who discontinued apixaban may have played a role in this phenomenon, this hypothesis cannot explain the similar finding in AVERROES, where no completing patients were expected or documented to have taken VKA in the post treatment period. Thus, it is reasonable to question whether some property of apixaban played a role in these findings. It is notable that the Applicant has not characterized the properties of the coagulation system in patients who have discontinued long-term treatment with apixaban. Such a study should be conducted; the details are yet to be determined.</p><p>The 4 tablet transition regimen used in ARISTOTLE did not appear to be beneficial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.10.3">Data Regarding Adjudication of the Primary Endpoint</head><p>The intent of the analysis below is to detect possible signals of bias favoring apixaban in the adjudication of strokes by the CEC. Strokes constituted the vast majority of event s in the primary endpoint analysis (456 of 487, 94%), and an advantage in preventing strokes accounted for the observed superiority of apixaban. Adjudication of strokes will thus be the focus of this section.</p><p>The adjudication process by the CEC is described in detail in Sec. 5.3.1.11. Strokes and TIAs were adjudicated as a group. A total of 964 stroke/TIA events were adjudicated; 452 and 512 from the apixaban and warfarin arms, respectively. The triggers for adjudication of these events in 99% of cases in each arm were stroke/TIA event forms submitted by investigators; other event triggers included adverse events or other information appended to the CRF that suggested that a stroke or TIA might have occurred.</p><p>Potential bias will be examined by analyzing two types of discordant results: (1) cases from the apixaban arm where the investigator considered an event to be a stroke but it was adjudicated as not a stroke and (2) cases from the warfarin arm that the investigator considered as not a stroke but the case was adjudicated as a stroke. Either type of case would tend to favor apixaban in the primary endpoint analysis. <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 80</ref> is a display of the number of adjudications with each type of discordance by arm. Type 1 discordance (investigator's determination was stroke and the adjudication result was no stroke, specifically, an adjudication of TIA or "No Event"), was observed for 109 vs. 137 cases (events) in the apixaban and warfarin arms, respectively. Thus, the net result of this type of discordance substantially favored the warfarin arm in the primary endpoint analysis. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Review of Safety</head><p>As discussed earlier, there is an ever evolving unknown rate of medication errors and unknown effect of the manual manipulations of the IVRS data on randomization. The apparent lack of the Applicant's knowledge of the issues make the reviewers uneasy about the monitoring and conduct of the trial and the potential implications on important endpoints. This information developed late during the review cycle, and the issues have not been resolved to our satisfaction. The Applicant does not appear to fully understand their data (answers to our questions went through multiple iterations, are not fully explained, and have only instigated more questions), the errors and the impact on safety. Moreover, the Applicant's medication error dataset appears to have errors in it whereby the data do not match the CRF and there are dates after database lock. This carelessness in cleaning the data adds to our skepticism of their responses to our medication error questions and makes us question their study conduct. The timing of the study conduct issues was late in the review cycle and much of the primary safety analyses were complete, so the review presented in this section essential ignores the medication errors. Sensitivity analyses for the fraud in China are presented in Sec 3.1.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Summary</head><p>Most of the safety data for apixaban comes from ARISTOTLE (trial discussed in Sec 5.3.1). This was the largest randomized trial for the reduction in risk of stroke in AFib to date. As mentioned earlier, over 18,000 subjects with at least one risk factor for stroke were randomized to warfarin or apixaban in this non-inferiority trial; of the subjects randomized to apixaban, &gt;95% of subjects received 5 mg po BID. Apixaban 2.5 mg po BID was for subjects with two out of three risk factors for bleeding at baseline. The mean duration of exposure, ~ 1.7 years, was adequate and similar to that of other large antithrombotic trials. The information from this trial alone is adequate to characterize the safety of apixaban. However, for specific events of interest (drug induced liver injury (DILI), rare serious neurologic adverse events, and concomitant antiplatelet therapy) the reviewer also analyzed the data in other trials.</p><p>The primary safety adjudicated endpoint was ISTH major bleed; a bleed that can be insignificant and readily reversible. However, the ISTH definition has historically been used in patients receiving long-term anticoagulation and was the primary safety endpoint in the last two NDAs for this indication. Certainly, it does not rise to the level of GUSTO severe or TIMI major definitions used in thrombolytic trials since the threshold for an ISTH major bleed is rather low (i.e., bleeding leading to a 2 unit transfusion of PRBC).</p><p>However, apixaban was consistently superior to warfarin for ISTH major bleed as well as for other serious bleeding (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 13</ref>). While we do not like to compare across studies, the reviewer did examine across studies to look for consistency (albeit there were some differences between RE-LY, ROCKET-AF and ARISTOTLE). Although the to both antithrombotics, the annual rate of major GI bleed was lower on apixaban compared to warfarin (by 0.1%) and relative to warfarin, there was no difference in major GI bleed. With the exception of intracranial and intra-ocular bleeds, the site of major bleeds was similar between subjects on either treatment. There were numerically more intra-ocular major bleeds on apixaban (n=33) compared to warfarin (n=22). There are pre-clinical data to support that there may be a pharmacologic basis for this; apixaban radioactivity was still present in the eyes of rats at 168 hours post dose while it was last measureable in plasma at 24 hours. If apixaban is approved, the reviewer recommends that information on major bleeding at this critical site be collected and reported to the Agency in their Safety updates. Attempts should be made to collect adequate information on the subject's medical history as to assess if a particular patient population may be at greater risk for major intra-ocular bleeding.</p><p>The reviewer conducted many analyses of all ARISTOTLE bleeding definitions and their relationship with TTR (time in range, time above range, time below range), a measure of warfarin control and safety. The overall mean TTR in ARISTOTLE was 62% (median 66%). l The many analyses did not show a consistent relationship between bleeding and TTR, suggesting that using TTR might not be a sensitive marker of individual warfarin control and ultimately bleeding events.</p><p>Analysis of countries by TTR quartiles shows that more than half of all US sites were above the median TTR of 66%; the same was true for Canada (the third highest enrolling country) (see <ref type="figure">Figure 22)</ref>. Russia was the second highest enrolling country, but more than half of the subjects were in the lowest quartile of TTR, suggesting that warfarin control was poor in most subjects treated in Russia. The Ukraine, China, and India were the 9 th , 10 th and 11 th top enrolling countries, but more than 75% of subjects in those countries were below the trial mean TTR of 62%.</p><p>Subgroup analyses of ISTH major bleed were generally consistent with the overall findings. A rather novel finding was that females on apixaban had less major bleeding than males and the relative benefit over warfarin was greater in females than in males. This finding is somewhat contrary to the results from a dedicated PK study that showed females have 15-18% higher concentrations than males, so one would not expect less bleeding in females based on PK. This reviewer is cautious about making conclusions based on un-prespecified subgroup analyses since findings can be spurious, and so would not recommend that this finding be included in labeling. Findings from subgroup analyses are hypotheses generating. As age increased, so did the risk of major bleeds, but relative to warfarin there was less major bleeding on apixaban in subjects â‰¥ 75 years old. While there were 5 subgroups m on apixaban that appeared to lose their bleeding advantage over warfarin, for many of these subgroups the effect size was still close to the overall trial effect size [ISTH major bleed apixaban/warfarin HR (95%CI): Apixaban does not appear to cause drug induced liver injury (DILI). There was one fatal case of hepatic failure that occurred on apixaban that independent, blinded, hepatologists judged as possibly related to apixaban or another drug (tianeptine). Otherwise, there were no probable cases and the number of potential Hy's Law cases was balanced between arms.</p><p>Apixaban does not appear to cause serious neurologic adverse events. In a P2 dose ranging trial there was 1 case of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) and 1 case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in subjects taking apixaban 5 mg QD and 10 mg QD, respectively. Following the two reports, the Applicant enhanced surveillance for neurological events in all Phase 3 studies by use of a supplemental Clinical Safety Plan (CSP) CRF (See Attachment 9, p.260). This CRF was used to attain more information to aid in the diagnosis of the neurologic event. For ARISTOTLE, this was instituted about 7 months after the first subject was enrolled. Neurological consultations were also recommended for any SAE that matched a specific list of MedDRA terms. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2010 (near study completion of January 31, 2011) the Applicant instituted external, blinded, independent neurologist assessments n of any SAEs with PTs included in the MedDRA high level of terms of "acute polyneuropathies" (acute polyneuropathy, critical illness polyneuropathy, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, Miller Fisher syndrome, and polyneuropathy) and PT amyotrophic lateral. There were a total of 6 GBS cases, 3 ALS cases and 7 cases of acute polyneuropathy identified in the NDA and Safety Update Report (SUR). All but one case were blindly reviewed; of these, all consensus assessments were "unlikely to be drug-related". One subject treated with apixaban did not have a consensus assessment as of late April 2012, but the three individual neurologists' assessments were 2 unlikely, 1 possible. Serious neurologic AEs occurred infrequently and were balanced between treatment arms in ARISTOTLE. Based on the totality of the data, the reviewer believes that apixaban does not cause serious neurologic AEs such as GBS, ALS or acute polyneuropathy.</p><p>The most common adverse event was bleeding. Minor bleeding and clinically relevant non major bleeding was lower in the apixaban arm than in the warfarin arm (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table  101</ref>). The reviewer was unable to complete the analysis of common adverse events because the sponsor's AE dataset contained errors that were likely created by an investigator filling out two or more CRFs for one unique event, a SAE CRF and a NSAE (non-serious adverse event) CRF. Monitoring did not appear to catch this. There was no systematic pattern for how this error happened, nor was there a way to easily fix the dataset since the AE term was sometimes mapped to different higher MedDRA terms. The Applicant's analysis of common AEs indicates that the frequency of AEs were similar between apixaban and warfarin.</p><p>n The external neurologists were Drs.</p><p>, who are recognized experts in peripheral nerve disease There were no significant laboratory findings. Thrombocytopenia was similar between treatment arms. There were no significant effects on vital signs or ECGs. The Thorough QT study was negative.</p><p>Renal elimination does not play a large role in the excretion of apixaban since its elimination is multimodal. So one would not expect a large effect of renal impairment on PK, and certainly there is not a significant one (see Sec 4.4.3). o However, it is known that subjects with renal impairment are inherently at risk for more adverse events, including bleeds and strokes. Event rates of both major bleeding and stroke/se increase in both treatment arms as level of renal impairment worsens <ref type="figure">(Figure 26 and  Figure 27</ref>). Relative to warfarin, apixaban has less major bleeding in subjects with mild-severe renal impairment. For stroke/se, there was no suggestion of worse outcome on apixaban relative to warfarin.</p><p>Apixaban is a substrate for CYP3A4 and the drug efflux transporter proteins, pglycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Coadministration with a strong inducer (rifampin) decreased apixaban concentrations by ~50% ( <ref type="figure">Figure  6)</ref>. Coadministration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp (ketoconazole) increases apixaban AUC by 100% (or 2-fold). The Clinical Pharmacology reviewers recommend, and I agree, to avoid concomitant use with strong CYP3A4/P-gp inducers, and reduce the apixaban dose by half when coadministered with a strong CYP3A44/Pgp inhibitor.</p><p>Because the APPRAISE-2 study contains meaningful concomitant antiplatelet information, the reviewer analyzed these data to assess the bleeding risk of apixaban coadministered with antiplatelet drugs. APPRAISE-2 was an ACS trial where randomization was stratified by single or dual antiplatelet therapy after the subject's index qualifying event. The trial was stopped early because the excess in TIMI major bleeding outweighed the benefit of a combined ischemic efficacy endpoint (CV death, MI and ischemic stroke). Single or dual antiplatelet therapy with apixaban had bleeding rates 2-8 times greater than with placebo. The bleeding risk was ~2 times greater in subjects on dual antiplatelet treatment and apixaban compared to single antiplatelet treatment and apixaban. Although the population in APPRAISE-2 is different than those in ARISTOTLE, to put the bleeding in perspective, the rate of ISTH bleeding in APPRAISE-2 on apixaban plus single antiplatelet therapy is almost 3 times greater, and with dual antiplatelet therapy is 6 times greater, than in ARISTOTLE where apixaban was used alone. The rate of bleeding (TIMI major and ISTH major) on apixaban plus single antiplatelet therapy in APPRAISE-2 was similar to the rate of bleeding on warfarin in ARISTOTLE. So in patients that need an anticoagulant and an antiplatelet it may be reasonable to use apixaban with a single antiplatelet. Clinical Review: Nhi Beasley and Martin Rose Application type: Priority, NDA 202155 ELIQUIS (apixaban) 189 examined ALL data by on treatment as defined by the Applicant and by the follow-up period. Thus, unlike the Applicant's analysis, all SAEs were not lumped into one period since there was precedence for an increase in adverse events after study drug discontinuation (seen with rivaroxaban). The Applicant's coding dictionary for bleeding events, hepatic events and neurologic events appears adequate.</p><p>Subjects who did not experience a bleeding endpoint were censored at the earlier of: 2 days after study drug discontinuation, death date, or last contact date when a full assessment was performed (for subjects who withdrew consent to be followed up or were lost to follow-up) at the end of the study. Superiority testing for the primary safety endpoint (ISTH major bleeding) was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model including treatment group as a covariate and stratified by region and prior VKA status.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.1">Studies/Clinical Trials Used to Evaluate Safety</head><p>The Applicant's primary safety sources are the AF studies, ARISTOTLE (CV185030) and AVERROES (CV185048). Each trial is described in Sec 5.3.1 ARISTOTLE and Sec 5.3.2 Supporting Study: AVERROES. The reviewer's safety analysis focused on data in ARISTOTLE (rather than AVERROES). Both trials assessed the same safety endpoint, however ARISTOTLE contained ~3x more subjects and treated subjects on average ~30 weeks longer than in AVERROES. Thus, the data in ARISTOTLE alone are sufficient to allow substantive assessment of the safety of apixaban in an AF population. Additionally, the comparator arm in ARISTOTLE was warfarin, an effective treatment widely used for the prevention of embolic events in AF, but causes serious bleeding. The Applicant asserts that apixaban causes less major bleeding than warfarin, the first drug to have this assertion; thus the reviewer critically examined this safety endpoint. In contrast, the comparator arm in AVERROES was aspirin which offers modest protection against stroke in AF. At the time of the NDA submission it was unclear to the review team the role (if any) that AVERROES would play in the approval decision. For certain safety events (rare neurologic events and DILI, and situations where the trial design was better suited for assessment of a particular safety issue) the reviewer also analyzed data from AVERROES and/or APPRAISE-2.</p><p>APPRAISE-2 (CV185068, Apixaban for Prevention of Acute Ischemic Events-2) was a phase 3, multi-national, randomized, double-blind study that compared apixaban (5 mg BID) to placebo in patients with recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and at least 2 additional risk factors for recurrent ischemic events. The primary endpoint was a composite of CV death, non-fatal MI and ischemic stroke in ACS. The trial started on March 17, 2009; the DMC stopped the trial early on November 14, 2010 because of an excess of clinically important bleeding that was not offset by clinically meaningful reductions in ischemic events in subjects on apixaban.</p><p>Some key elements of APPRAISE-2 include: </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.2">Categorization of Adverse Events</head><p>Reviewer's Comment: The Applicant's adverse events analysis dataset (adae.xpt) contains more than one line of observation for the same event for some subjects whereby the same unique event is listed as serious in one line and non-serious in the next line. While it is conceivable that an event initially reported as an AE may become an SAE (indeed this was in the Applicant's protocol to fill out both CRFs if this was the case), it is apparent that the reason for multiple lines of observation for the same unique Clinical Review: Nhi Beasley and Martin Rose Application type: Priority, NDA 202155 ELIQUIS (apixaban) 194 often as every 2 weeks to on average monthly) depending on the number of subjects enrolled in the trial (personal communication with the Applicant on March 1, 2012). All of the algorithms (except MI and thrombocytopenia) used select MedDRA preferred terms to identify events of interest; hepatobiliary, MI and thrombocytopenia algorithms included laboratory abnormalities. These adverse events of interest were followed-up with a Clinical Safety Plan (CSP) CRF specific for that AE <ref type="figure">(Attachment 9)</ref>.</p><p>The Applicant did a reasonable job identifying potential cases of DILI with the one caveat that the cases submitted for blinded, independent review had the potential to exclude subjects with significant total bilirubin elevations that occurred after the transaminase elevation. This is because the selected cases were for those subjects with elevations of ALT&gt;3xULN and total bilirubin&gt;2xULN on the same day or for subjects with SAE of jaundice, hepatitis, and hepatic failure. Since hepatocellular injury may take time to impair bilirubin clearance, clinically significant elevations in both transaminase and total bilirubin may not occur simultaneously.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.1">Deaths</head><p>Mortality was a primary efficacy endpoint, so it is discussed in Sec 6.1.5.1. The safety reviewer did examine cause of death during the ITT period and the treatment period in ARISTOTLE. Other than the numerically higher number of deaths during the treatment period (266 on apixaban, 296 on warfarin) and in the trial overall (656 on apixaban, 717 on warfarin) compared to the ITT period (apixaban 603, warfarin 669), the causes of death were similar between periods. There were some numerical imbalances (e.g., death from infection on treatment apixaban 20, warfarin 12, death from MI post dose apixaban 9, warfarin 6), but the numbers are too small to make general conclusions. The most common cause of death was sudden death. There were more deaths from trauma in the warfarin arm (9) compared to apixaban (4), but the numbers are too small to make any conclusions regarding the ability to stop fatal bleeding due to trauma in subjects on apixaban.</p></div>

Although this discussion could be placed in Section 7.3.5. Submission specific primary safety concerns, because some major bleeding was serious, the reviewer placed it here. In ARISTOTLE, the time to first ISTH major bleed was the primary safety endpoint <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 14)</ref>. There was an early separation between the two treatments with more events occurring in the warfarin arm; this difference was maintained throughout the trial. The risk of first ISTH major bleed was 31% lower on apixaban as compared to warfarin (p&lt;0.0001). The absolute risk per Clinical Review: Nhi Beasley and Martin Rose Application type: Priority, NDA 202155 ELIQUIS (apixaban) 195 100 subject years was 3.1% on warfarin and 2.1% on apixaban; this difference means that treating 100 patients for a year with apixaban (versus warfarin) will avoid 1 major bleed.</p></div>

This just supports that in subjects that bleed, they are likely to bleed again irrespective of treatment.</p><p>In contrast to major bleeds during the treatment period, the post treatment period had more major bleeds in the apixaban arm compared to the warfarin arm. The events in the apixaban arm were fairly equal from one week to the next (averaging 11 events per week). In contrast, most of the events (n=16) in the warfarin arm occurred in the first week off drug. The timing of the events in the apixaban arm are not suggestive that they may in part be due to warfarin initiation. Nevertheless to look at this issue further, the reviewer also examined major bleeding by VKA status after drug initiation <ref type="figure">(Figure  23)</ref>. Although the events are few, during treatment initiation, there were more major bleeds in subjects randomized to apixaban who were VKA experienced (the most bleeds were not in subjects randomized to warfarin who were VKA naÃ¯ve). Major bleeds in warfarin naÃ¯ve subjects began to exceed the other subjects after about 15 days of Clinical Review: Nhi Beasley and Martin Rose Application type: Priority, NDA 202155 ELIQUIS (apixaban) 198 difference, however, was not significant. u Similar to rivaroxaban, the majority (~60%) of the GI bleeds was in the upper GI tract (reviewer's analysis: location\GI, Applicant's dataset adbl2). So while the site of major bleeding was primarily in the GI tract (upper GI tract to be more specific), relative to warfarin, the major GI bleeding was not different.</p></div>

HR=apixabn/warfarin Although the numbers were small, there were more intra-ocular bleeds on apixaban (0.2%/year) than on warfarin (0.1%/year). The numbers were likely too small to show a relative difference. The pharm/tox review points out that apixaban radioactivity was still measurable in the eye at 168 hours after the dose while the last measureable time point in plasma was 24 hours. Thus, there are pre-clinical data to suggest that the difference in intra-ocular bleeds, albeit small, are likely due to inherent properties of apixaban. If apixaban is approved, the Applicant should monitor and report major bleeding, but special consideration should be given to intra-ocular bleeding as it may warrant a more prominent highlight in the label. The other components of the ISTH major bleed definition, a Hgb reduction of â‰¥ 2 g/dL . a transfusion of â‰¥ 2 U of PRBC, and a fatal bleed are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 87</ref> along with other components of popular bleeding definitions such as GUSTO severe bleeding. After adjusting for the larger number of total bleeds in warfarin treated subjects, the characteristics of the major bleeds between the two treatment arms were balanced. About 50% of all bleeds required hospitalizations, 30% required medical or surgical intervention, and 13% led to hemodynamic compromise. Of the major bleeds ~8-10% (35/355 on apixaban and 37/493 on warfarin) met the definition solely by hemoglobin drop (reviewer's analysis: bleed\components, Applicant dataset adblsaf). In other words, these subjects did not have major bleeding at a critical site and other criteria for an ISTH major bleed were negative. There was a small number of adjudicated fatal bleeds, with a numerically higher number in warfarin treated subjects. Clinical Review: Nhi Beasley and Martin Rose Application type: Priority, NDA 202155 ELIQUIS (apixaban) 201 was strikingly similar to that seen in RE-LY for dabigatran 150 mg. There was a 59% relative reduction in ICH on apixaban as compared to warfarin in ARISTOTLE. The absolute risk per 100 subject years was 0.82% on warfarin and 0.33% on apixaban; this difference means that treating 1000 patients for a year with warfarin results in 5 more ICH compared to apixaban.</p></div>

However, part of the reason why these analyses are done by sites is because sites with good warfarin control might also be sights were quality of care is also better, thus there is an impact in subjects treated with apixaban also. And thus, there would be little change in relative risk. Quartile analysis of time in range did not show a consistent clear relationship between bleeding (not even for all serious bleeds) and time in range. The analysis that showed the most consistent trend was for GUSTO severe bleeding; as time in range improved, the annual event rate of bleeding decreased in both arms. Since both treatment arms had less bleeds as TTR improved, there was little change in relative risk. Some of the analyses are shown below. The site mean time in range was 63%. The site mean time below range was 24% and the mean time above range was 14%. The medians are evident in the tables that follow.</p><p>Reference ID: 3134464 Compared to the overall trial results, in the United States the rates of major bleeding on each treatment was higher (+0.7%) and the relative benefit of apixaban over warfarin was slightly less, HR 0.75 (95%CI, 0.56, 1.00), nominal p-value=0.0497.  On treatment analyses of the two doses show that apixaban 2.5 mg was safe (ISTH major bleed) and effective (stroke/se) ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 94</ref>). While the rates of major bleeding were higher in the low dose arm compared to the 5 mg arm, the effect relative to warfarin was actually better compared to that in subjects treated with apixaban 5 mg. So it appears that the Applicant's criteria for subjects at risk for bleeding worked; these subjects had more bleeding on warfarin and using a lower dose of apixaban showed a greater relative difference (HR(95%CI): 0.50 (0.29, 0.86). The rates of stroke/SE were also higher in subjects at greater risk of bleeding, but apixaban was effective relative to warfarin. In sum, based on the data in ARISTOTLE, the lower dose of apixaban was safe and effective and should be approved for subjects at high risk for bleeding as defined in the trial.</p><p>moderate to severe renal impairment and 3603 ng*hr/mL in all 5 mg treated subjects (so includes all levels of renal impairment). A dedicated renal impairment study (CV185018) showed a 30-40% increase in apixaban concentration in subjects with moderate to severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function.</p><p>Reference ID: 3134464 Subgroup analysis of subjects with high body weight (â‰¥120 kg), another population with ~25% lower apixaban concentration, is supportive of the efficacy <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">(Table 96)</ref>. This suggests that the 25% lower apixaban exposure does not result in a loss of benefit. Reviewer's comment: The reviewer is recommending that apixaban 2.5 mg BID be approved for patients at risk for bleeding as defined in ARISTOTLE. The same reviewer recommended not approving the lower dose of dabigatran (110 mg). The factors that led to the differences in decision on the lower dose of each drug are worth elucidating. In RE-LY, subjects were randomized equally to one of three treatment arms. Post hoc comparisons between the high dose versus the low dose were allowed and showed that the higher dose was more effective on stroke/SE than the lower dose (HR 0.72, 95%CI: 0.58, 0.90), albeit there was more bleeding (HR 1.16, 95%CI: 1.00, 1.34). Moreover, the lower dose was associated with more ischemic strokes than either dabigatran 150 mg or warfarin (See <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>). Exploratory analyses of the lower dose did not find any subpopulation where benefit outweighed the risk. Perhaps the largest contrast between ARISTOTLE and RE-LY is that in ARISTOTLE, the study was designed such that a particular subgroup deemed to be at risk for bleeding received the lower dose. And in this subgroup, both safety and effectiveness were preserved and event rates were more favorable on apixaban 2.5 mg.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.2.2">Other Nonfatal Serious Adverse Events</head><p>The reviewer analyzed the SAE data at all MedDRA levels including system organ class (SOC), high level group term (HLGT), high level term (HLT), and preferred term (PT). At each level of analysis, the reviewer examined the data by frequency of occurrence in each arm and by risk difference between arms. The results were compared on treatment and from Day 3-30 days post dose (to look for a possible increase in embolic events post dose).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.5.1">Drug induced liver injury (DILI)</head><p>Because ximelagatran, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, was associated with hepatotoxicity, drug induced liver injury (DILI) has been the subject of intense monitoring and interim safety assessments in the development program of subsequent antithrombotics. However, neither dabigatran nor rivaroxaban were associated with DILI in trials with a warfarin comparator. Apixaban does not appear to be associated with DILI either.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 25 of important liver tests that could indicate</head><p>Hy's Law subjects shows that the number of subjects is the similar in both treatment arms for both ARISTOTLE and AVERROES. aa Since the active comparator is not associated with DILI, the distribution of liver tests does not heighten a cause for concern that apixaban may cause DILI.  As mentioned earlier, Sec 7.2.6, the Applicant had the potential to miss a case of DILI because of the selection criteria. Of the 50 reviewer identified potential Hy's Law subjects in ARISTOTLE, the hepatologists reviewed 38 of these cases. The causality assessment of the 38 cases indicates that apixaban is unlikely to cause DILI. Of the remaining unassessed cases, 5 were on apixaban and 7 were on warfarin. None had significant ALT elevations (they had significant AST elevations with concurrent (as defined by the reviewer) total bilirubin elevations). The reviewer judged the apixaban cases to be 4 unlikely, and 1 inadequate cc information.</p><p>There was one fatal liver failure case that occurred during the open label extension phase of study CV185048 (thus, he is not counted in the figures or tables in this review). He was a 92 year old man who was diagnosed with liver failure after 8 months of apixaban. He did not receive apixaban during the blinded phase of the study. In addition to AFib, he also had right-sided heart failure and moderate renal impairment. Three expert hepatopathologists, (Drs. ) interpreted and agreed that his post-mortem liver biopsy showed "massive hepatic necrosis consistent with DILI and less consistent with ischemic liver injury". dd Approximately 6-7 months prior to hospitalization, the subject started tianeptine 12.5 mg bid, an antidepressant that has been associated with liver injury. He was also taking rilmenidine, a loop diuretic, budesonide, and tiotropium bromide. Drs.</p><p>agreed that the causality assessment should be "possibly related". Given apixaban's clean track record to date and known liver cc Subject CV185030-19-1912 dd There was disagreement as to the onset of the event; Dr.</p><p>dated onset as within one month of death, Dr. stated the onset was possibly two months prior to hospitalization.  The adjudication of myocardial infarction tended to favor apixaban; there were more MIs reported in the apixaban arm, however more MIs were adjudicated as "no MI" compared to warfarin. This happened so much so that there were numerically more adjudicated MIs in the warfarin arm.</p><p>The adjudication packages appeared to be reasonably cleaned to maintain blindness.

For apixaban arm patients, the site was provided with the true INR if the true INR was &gt; 4.1. Otherwise, a sham INR was provided. The sham value was in part dependent on the last 3 warfarin/placebo doses entered into the system to seem realistic. True INR values &lt;0.8 or &gt; 9.9 for patients in either arm generated requests for additional blood samples to be sent to the central laboratory for testing. INR results were provided to the site by phone (via computergenerated speech) and also sent within 24 hours via the site's preferred written contact mode (fax and/or email). The rationale for providing true INR values &gt;4.1 for apixaban arm patients is not stated. However, it might have protected patients somewhat from medication errors (i.e., dispensing of active warfarin instead of placebo for warfarin), which were not rare in this study.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Clinical Review: Nhi Beasley and Martin Rose</cell></row><row><cell>Application type: Priority, NDA 202155</cell></row><row><cell>ELIQUIS (apixaban)</cell></row><row><cell>Reviewer Comment: The study documents included dosing guidelines for the initiation of warfarin therapy.</cell></row><row><cell>The protocol recommended the following --</cell></row><row><cell>o For subjects who taking warfarin at baseline, the recommendation was to begin</cell></row><row><cell>study therapy at the patient's previous dose, if known.</cell></row><row><cell>o For those who were not taking warfarin at baseline or those whose warfarin dose</cell></row><row><cell>was not know, the following was recommended:</cell></row><row><cell>o In subjects &lt; 80 years old, initiate warfarin at a dose of up to 6 mg/day,</cell></row><row><cell>with INR testing on day 3 or 4.</cell></row><row><cell>o In subjects â‰¥ 80 years old, initiate warfarin at a dose of up to 4 mg/day,</cell></row><row><cell>with INR testing on day 3 or 4.</cell></row><row><cell>76</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

In the US studies, INR had not yet been adopted widely, and the INR target (and its attainment) was back-calculated from the PT target and the assumed ISI of the thromboplastin used in the PT assay. The INR target range of ARISTOTLE, 2.0 to 3.0, falls within the range of INR targets for the placebo-controlled trials. Similarly, the mean j Satisfaction of the constancy assumption is generally critical to the validity a non-inferiority trial. This involves an assessment of the likelihood that the effect of the active control in the NI study of interest is similar to its effect in the trials that established the efficacy of the active control. It requires an assessment of dose, patient characteristics, concomitant therapies, definition and ascertainment of endpoints, and other study design and execution features. 62%, falls within in the range of mean TTR or % of INRs in range in the placebo controlled trials. Thus, it seems that constancy holds for the issue of control of anticoagulation as an isolated question.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Reference ID: 3134464</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1">For example, to determine the number of apixaban-treated subjects needed to negate the statistically significant mortality finding, subjects are ordered by apixaban treatment, then censor date. Events are sequentially imputed to apixaban-treated subjects without events until the results are not statistically significant. Because the cox proportional hazards model is dependent on time, this analysis is highly conservative since the additional events are occurring early in the trial.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2">The remaining 7 subjects with a fatal stroke (5 in the warfarin arm and 2 in the apixaban arm) did not have either a "stroke" in the study database nor a date for the stroke, but they had a date and adjudicated cause for mortality. While these patients were included in analyses of death, they were not included in analyses of stroke or the primary endpoint performed by the applicant or by FDA.</note>

Anti-FXa activity was ~ 15-20% less in the apixaban 2.5 mg group compared to the 5 mg group; this corresponds with the 25% lower apixaban concentration in the 2.5 mg group. The study was planned to end after the event target of 448 adjudicated primary endpoint events was reached. Late in the study, it was estimated that the target would be reached on January 30, 2011. This date was set as the end of the "intended treatment period," which marked the cutoff for the primary efficacy endpoint analysis. At this time, the sites were notified to schedule end of study visits. There was no open-label roll-over period.</p></div>

Men or women aged â‰¥18 years with non-valvular AFib or AFl not due to a reversible cause 2. AFib or AFl was to be documented by ECG evidencea. at the time of enrollment (i.e., screening) OR b. on two occasions at least 2 weeks apart in the 12 months prior to enrollment 3. At least one of the following risk factors for stroke was presenta. Age 75 years or older b. Prior stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA) or SE c. Either symptomatic congestive heart failure within 3 months or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with an LV ejection fraction (LVEF) â‰¤40% by echocardiography, radionuclide study or contrast angiography d. Diabetes mellitus e. Hypertension requiring pharmacological treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Patient provided signed written informed consent</head><p>Reviewer Comment: These risk criteria would lead to a population with all subjects having a CHADS 2 score of at least 1. The risk criteria are similar to those of RE-LY (a study of dabigatran) but less stringent than those of ROCKET (a study of rivaroxaban), in which most patients had a CHADS 2 score of 3 or more.</p><p>Patients who met any one or more of the following criteria were excluded:</p><p>â€¢ AF due to reversible causes (e.g., thyrotoxicosis, pericarditis) â€¢ Clinically significant (moderate or severe) mitral stenosis â€¢ Increased bleeding risk that was believed to be a contraindication to oral anticoagulation (e.g., previous intracranial hemorrhage) â€¢ Conditions other than atrial fibrillation that require chronic anticoagulation (e.g. prosthetic mechanical heart valve) Highly significant results in favor of apixaban were obtained for the primary endpoint and the composite of stroke/SE/MI/vascular death. There was a trend in favor of apixaban for all-cause death (p=0.07). Note that a hierarchical analysis was not prespecified.</p><p>Information on rates of the individual components of the primary endpoint and other secondary endpoints are discussed below.</p><p>The Kaplan-Meier curve for time to first primary efficacy event in the protocol-specified primary efficacy analysis is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> . </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Endpoints</head><p>Rates for the occurrence of secondary and tertiary endpoints in the ITT Population during the ITP are displayed in <ref type="table">Table 27</ref>. These endpoints include the individual components of the primary endpoint (types of stoke, systemic embolism), as well as MI, vascular death, and non-vascular death. The data indicate the most of the advantage of time to the first occurrence of a primary endpoint event in the ITT Population during the intended treatment period (ITP, defined as the time from randomization up to January 30, 2011, which was estimated late in the study as the day the primary efficacy event target would be reached). The Applicant's intent (for US regulatory purposes) was to establish that apixaban is non-inferior to warfarin, using a non-inferiority (NI) margin of 1.38 for the hazard ratio and a 95% CI.</p><p>The results for the primary endpoint analysis are shown below in <ref type="table">Table 42</ref> and <ref type="figure">Figure  10</ref>. Unless otherwise specified, all efficacy analyses pool data from the roughly 5% of patients who received apixaban 2.5 mg bid (the dose in those with at least 2 of the 3 specified risk criteria for bleeding) with the remainder of patients who received 5 mg bid.</p><p>There were 212 and 265 first primary efficacy events in the apixaban and warfarin arms, respectively, yielding respective event rates of 1.27 and 1.60 events per 100 patientyears and a hazard ratio of 0.79 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.95). The p for non-inferiority was &lt;0.0001 with a NI margin of 1.38. The p for superiority was also significant, with a value of 0.0114. Note the in the pre-specified event hierarchy, if non-inferiority is established, the Applicant may examine superiority of subsequent events at a one-sided p of 0.02499, which takes into account one interim analysis. 169 stroke/SE in completers was significantly higher in the rivaroxaban arm than in the warfarin arm , with a point estimate for the HR of about 4. The reviewer (MR) agreed with the rivaroxaban Applicant that the increased rate of events in the rivaroxaban arm after the last dose of study drug was probably related to inadequate control of anticoagulation, but that induction of a hypercoagulable state by long term treatment with rivaroxaban had not been ruled out. Note that the PI for rivaroxaban includes a boxed warning about the increased risk of stroke in patients who discontinue rivaroxaban and recommends that when rivaroxaban is must be discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding, the health care provider should "â€¦consider administering another anticoagulant." <ref type="table">Table 72</ref> shows the event types and timing of events in the study arms for the events represented in <ref type="table">Table 71</ref>. In the apixaban arm, the 21 events included 13 ischemic strokes, 3 hemorrhagic strokes, 4 strokes of uncertain type, and 2 SE. Note that all 3 hemorrhagic strokes occurred in the 15 to 30 day segment (all in subjects given VKA in the 1-30 day period), and 3 of the 4 strokes of uncertain type occurred during this same segment. The 5 events in the warfarin arm included 3 ischemic strokes and 2 SE. noted as taking open-label aspirin during the post-treatment period; in both cases, it had been started before the end of study treatment and carried over. One patient received parenteral anticoagulation on an unspecified date during the post-treatment period. None was noted to have received a VKA, consistent with the study's inclusion criteria.</p><p>The nine patients in the apixaban arm with events had a mean baseline CHADS 2 score of 2.9, compared to 2.0 for the study as a whole. The distribution by score was: 1 patients with a score of 1; 2 with a score of 2, 4 with a score of 3, and 1 each with scores of 4 and 5.</p><p>The one patient in the aspirin arm with a stroke was 83 yo man with a baseline CHADS 2 score of 4 who had an ischemic stroke on Day 6. No concomitant medications are listed.</p><p>The event rates for all cause death during the 30 day post-treatment period in completers were elevated over the rate in the ITT analysis, but were similar in the apixaban and warfarin arms (9 vs. 10 events, 11-12 events per 100 pt-years, data not shown). Events were fairly evenly distributed throughout the 30 day post treatment period in both arms.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The data for primary endpoint events in AVERROES completers during the 30 days after the last dose of study drug are qualitatively similar to the analogous data in ARISTOTLE -an elevated rate of stroke in a apixaban arm that is significantly higher than the rate in the warfarin arm. Most events in the apixaban arm occurred after the first week of the post treatment period, and ischemic/unknown strokes predominated. The patients with strokes in this period tended to have a higher baseline risk score than the randomized study population. However, unlike the ARISTOTLE patients, there is no suggestion that initiation of warfarin played a role in these strokes.</p><p>The anti-platelet effects of aspirin are irreversible with respect to each exposed platelet, but platelet turnover (about 10%/day) results in loss of aspirin effect over time. The duration of the useful antiplatelet effects of aspirin has been estimated to be about 4 days in healthy volunteers. <ref type="bibr">13,</ref><ref type="bibr">14</ref> It is interesting that most events in the apixaban arm occurred more than 8 days after the last dose, vs. no events in the aspirin arm during this period, when aspirin's antiplatelet effects should have dissipated.</p><p>Thus, the post-treatment event data from completers in AVERROES suggest that patients who stop long term therapy with apixaban may be at higher risk of stroke than those who stop long term therapy with aspirin. While the number of completers who had strokes in the post-treatment period was small compared the number of strokes prevented during treatment, it seems prudent to try to understand this phenomenon in order to prevent it. A PMR should be considered Reviewer Comment: This reviewer does not agree with the Applicant that there is not a strong rationale for examination of the coagulation system in patients who have discontinued long-term treatment with apixaban. Two studies of apixaban have demonstrated that stroke rates in completing patients were significantly higher in the apixaban arm patients than in the control arm over the 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Similar findings were observed in the ROCKET study of rivaroxaban, another FXa inhibitor. The Applicant's arguments do not rule out an effect on one of the many coagulation system constituents that might not alter the PT during treatment with apixaban. The fact that event rates were elevated compared to aspirin during the post-treatment period in AVERROES suggests that poor warfarin control in warfarin naÃ¯ve patients cannot explain all the findings.</p><p>Thus, the Applicant should be required to conduct a post-approval study to examine the effects of long term therapy with apixaban on the coagulation system. The details of such a study are to be determined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.10.2.4">Instructions for the transition from apixaban to warfarin</head><p>The Applicant has submitted proposed labeling with instructions for transition from apixaban to warfarin based on the optional transition regimen used in ARISTOTLE. The text of the instructions follows: Type 2 discordance, i.e., the investigator's determination was no stroke (specifically, TIA or "stroke/TIA" or in a very few cases, no assessment at all) and the adjudication result was stroke, occurred in 17 and 12 cases in the apixaban and warfarin arms, respectively. Again, the net result of this type of discordance favored the warfarin arm, although the difference between the arms was small. In the few adjudicated cases where the investigator did not make an assessment of stroke or TIA, the case was picked up through review of AE forms or other clinical information that suggested a stroke may have occurred. The Applicant included information from the adjudication packages for all primary endpoint adjudications in the provided eCRFs. This reviewer (MR) examined the adjudication packages for 11 of the Type 1 discordance cases from the apixaban arm and 12 of the Type 2 cases from the warfarin arm. In each case, the adjudication result had a reasonable basis in the medical information provided, although in the majority of cases, the investigator's determination also could have been supported reasonably by the information provided.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The above information provides no evidence of bias favoring apixaban in the adjudication process. . Many of the intra-ocular bleeds were in diabetics and if apixaban is approved, the Applicant should look closer at this patient population. VKA status did not reduce major bleeding on warfarin. Compared to the overall trial, the rates of major bleeding in the US were higher (+0.7%) and the relative benefit of apixaban over warfarin was slightly less, HR 0.75 (95%CI, 0.56, 1.00), nominal p-value=0.0497.</p><p>Apixaban 2.5 mg BID, given to subjects having at least 2 of 3 risk factors for bleeding (age â‰¥ 80 years, weight â‰¤ 60 kg or serum creatinine â‰¥1.5 mg/dL) at baseline, was safe and effective. This dose adjustment was not based on PK (exposure in these subjects treated with 2.5 mg was 25% lower than (not equivalent) subjects treated with 5 mg). Most subjects qualified by age and weight. Although &lt;5% of subjects received the lower dose, apixaban 2.5 mg was superior to warfarin on major bleed and stroke/SE (see <ref type="table">Table 94</ref>). Major bleeding was higher in subjects with at least 2 out of 3 risk factors (despite the lower apixaban concentrations) compared to those without 2 out of 3 risk factors, suggesting that bleeding in this subgroup was more due to the population than to apixaban. The dose adjustment translated into a greater relative benefit over warfarin [(HR (95%CI) for apixaban 2.5 mg/warfarin, 0.50 (0.29, 0.86) versus apixaban 5 mg/warfarin, 0.71(0.61, 0.82)]. While the rate of stroke/se was also higher in this population, apixaban 2.5 mg had greater relative benefit over warfarin [(HR (95%CI) for apixaban 2.5 mg/warfarin, 0.40 (0.18, 0.88) versus apixaban 5 mg/warfarin, 0.80 (0.65, 0.98)]. If apixaban is approved, the lower dose should be approved and prescribed as used in ARISTOTLE.</p><p>Of the other SAEs there was numerically more syncope on apixaban (n=77) than on warfarin (n=47). The reviewer cannot explain this, but it is worth noting in the label.</p><p>Generally, there were no differences in reasons for treatment discontinuation (by System Organ Class) between treatment arms. However in the trial as a whole, more subjects discontinued for an AE in the warfarin arm (8.4% vs. 7.6%, respectively). This was driven in part by a nearly three-fold higher number of warfarin-treated subjects with discontinuations for injury, poisoning, and procedural complications (63 (0.7%) vs. 22 (0.2%) subjects, respectively). The most common reason for treatment discontinuation was in the SOC of nervous system disorders (1.5% of subjects on apixaban vs. 1.7% on warfarin) which consisted mostly of stroke/TIA events, followed by gastrointestinal disorders. There were numerically more major bleeds after apixaban discontinuation (n=44) compared to after warfarin discontinuation (n=29). Sparse data were collected after drug discontinuation. To investigate whether the excess bleeds was due in part from the inability to properly initiate warfarin treatment, the reviewer analyzed the major bleeds after starting treatment. The analyses as well as data in AVERROES do not support this contention. Unfortunately data collection after drug discontinuation was too sparse to know definitively the cause of the excess bleeds. There was not an imbalance in cancers between apixaban and warfarin. The effect of apixaban in pregnancy and lactation has not been studied.</p><p>Preclinical data suggests that activated charcoal may be useful for apixaban overdose.</p><p>Adjudication of major bleeds appeared balanced, and did not appear to strongly favor apixaban. Adjudication of MI, however, did tend to favor apixaban.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Methods</head><p>The Applicant's summary of clinical safety (SCS) includes information from 23,718 treated subjects with AF (11,886 apixaban, 11,832 warfarin or aspirin) from two large clinical trials, ARISTOTLE and AVERROES, and safety information for 218 subjects with AF who completed a Phase 2 study (CV185067) in Japan. The Applicant did not pool the data from the two Phase 3 trials because of the following differences between the two studies: population (warfarin suitable versus "unsuitable"), comparator arm (warfarin versus aspirin), and treatment duration (1.7 versus 1.1 years). The Applicant also included a safety report for 22,386 subjects in non-AF indications.</p><p>Reviewer's Comment: It was reasonable to not pool the data based on the different comparator arms. ARISTOTLE has substantive data for a safety review.</p><p>The study design and safety monitoring plans of both trials were similar and appropriate for a large antithrombotic trial. Both ARISTOTLE and AVERROES were event driven trials, so subjects continued study medication until enough subjects reached the primary efficacy endpoint (stroke/SE in both trials). There was a 30 day follow-up period for safety events; however, as is customary for event driven trials, subjects who discontinued study drug were followed for efficacy until enough primary endpoint events were reached. Subjects in AVERROES could enter into a long term open label extension study (LTOLE). Both Phase 3 AF trials had an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), an external independent clinical events adjudication committee (CEC), three expert independent hepatologists who blindly assessed causality of specific hepatic events, and three independent neurologists who blindly assessed subjects with preselected neurologic AE/SAEs.</p><p>The Applicant's safety analyses are presented by treatment period (first dose to 2 days post dose) and by the follow-up period (Day 3 post dose to Day 30). For the on treatment analysis, subjects without the event of interest were censored at the earliest of the last date of the study drug + 2 days or the death date. SAEs occurring up to 30 days after the last dose are counted towards the "Treatment period" in the Clinical Study Report.</p><p>Reviewer's Comment: The planned oversight of safety data and collection of adverse events appears adequate and typical for a large antithrombotic trial. The proposed time periods for safety assessment are appropriate; however the reviewer's safety analysis Since hemorrhagic strokes were also counted in the efficacy analysis, the reviewer removed hemorrhagic strokes from the safety analysis for ISTH major bleeding. After excluding hemorrhagic strokes, the relative benefit of apixaban over warfarin was reduced by 4%, but still statistically significant; there was a 27% relative reduction in ISTH major bleed on apixaban compared to warfarin. Instead of treating 100 patients (as stated in Sec 7.3.2.1), one would have to treat 141 patients to avoid one major bleed on apixaban compared to warfarin. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.4">Significant Adverse Event</head><p>The Applicant discusses hepatic safety, neurological events, and non-traumatic fracture events in this section of their CSR. The first two are reviewed in Sec 7.3.5.1 and 7.3.5.2. The incidence of new non-traumatic fractures was 0.8% in both treatment groups during the treatment period. Fractures in the spine, rib, or hip were reported in â‰¤ 0.2% of subjects in both treatment groups (Applicant's analysis, Table S.6.9.A1 in ARISTOTLE CSR). In the follow-up period, there were 4 fractures in the apixaban group and none in the warfarin group.</p><p>Reviewer comment: The reviewer was unable to complete this section of the review according to the safety review template for reasons already described in Sec 7.1.2. Analyses outstanding include: severe AE, non-serious adverse events that led to an intervention (significant additional concomitant therapy or temporary drug discontinuation).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.5">Submission Specific Primary Safety Concerns</head><p>The submission specific primary safety concerns are bleeding, drug induced liver injury (DILI) and serious neurologic adverse events (other than stroke) such as Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 221 liability with tianeptine, they felt that tianeptine was the more likely cause of the subject's liver failure.</p><p>Subsequent to their consensus, Dr. discussed the case with two expert hepatologists who have published on tianeptine liver injury, Drs.</p><p>. These hepatologists indicated that tianeptine is a mitochondrial toxin that can cause idiosyncratic hepatocellular injury (but is quite rare). Additionally, the liver injury from tianeptine is generally a mixed hepatocellular-cholestatic injury. The doctors were also unaware of acute liver failure associated with tianeptine. There was a subsequent teleconference between Drs. where Dr.</p><p>felt that although the liver biopsy was most consistent with DILI, liver ischemia could not be excluded. However the massive nature of the injury was not typical for ischemia. The paucity of inflammation in the liver favored an acute dosedependent toxic injury such as is typical for acetaminophen rather than a delayed idiosyncratic type injury that would be expected from a drug exposure for multiple months. There was no history of acetaminophen ingestion, but the family had disposed of all of the subject's medications after his death. The consensus remained that a role for apixaban in the liver injury of this subject remained "possible".</p><p>The Applicant's analysis of liver related AEs, SAEs (including deaths) and discontinuations (using liver SMQs) also do not indicate a signal for apixaban DILI. There were five SAEs with a fatal outcome in each arm, no liver transplants, 26 AE leading to discontinuation in the apixaban arm and 35 in the warfarin arm.</p><p>Elevations of various categories of liver tests were balanced between arms (reviewer's analysis \hep\alt_tb_time, sponsor's dataset adliver1, data not shown).</p><p>In addition to cases in ARISTOTLE, the external hepatologists reviewed cases in APPRAISE-2 (all judged unlikely).</p><p>In sum, the data in the application do not suggest that apixaban causes DILI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.5.2">Neurologic events</head><p>Also specific for apixaban, was the potential for serious neurological adverse events. This was an adverse event of interest because of 1 case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 1 case of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) in subjects taking apixaban 10 mg QD and 5 mg QD, respectively, in a Phase 2 study. ee 2007) Adverse events of special interest, about 7 months after the first subject was enrolled. All AE reports were to be compared to a list of MedDRA terms that are suggestive of possible neuropathies or other neurological events. If the AE matched any of the terms and lasted for at least 7 days or resulted in a neurology consult, a CSP CRF was to be filled out. This CRF collected additional information to aid in the work up of a potential serious neurologic AE. Neurological consultations were recommended for any SAE that matched the list of MedDRA terms.</p><p>Additionally, in the second quarter of 2010 (near study completion of January 31, 2011) the Applicant instituted external, blinded, independent neurologist assessments ff of any SAEs with PTs included in the MedDRA high level of terms of "acute polyneuropathies" (acute polyneuropathy, critical illness polyneuropathy, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, Miller Fisher syndrome, and polyneuropathy) and PT amyotrophic lateral. The table below highlights the subjects with diagnosed serious neurologic AEs discussed in the apixaban NDA and SUR. All were blindly assessed except for subject CV185068-279-3923 (critical illness polyneuropathy on apixaban); it is unclear why this subject did not have a blinded assessment. However, after reviewing the CIOMS and neurology consult, the reviewer believes that the event that started 15 days after drug discontinuation is unlikely to be drug related. All blinded consensus assessments deemed the SAE to be unlikely related to the drug. There was not a consensus assessment available for subject CV185010-131-18, one of the subjects that heightened the surveillance for the neurology CSP in the Phase 3 program. The individual assessments were 2 unlikely and 1 possible for this subject.  In ARISTOTLE, serious neurologic AEs occurred infrequently and were balanced in each group (29 subjects in each arm). Six subjects in the apixaban arm and 8 subjects in the warfarin arm had neurological events that led to treatment discontinuation. The AEs that led to discontinuation in the apixaban arm included paresthesia, burning sensation, peripheral neuropathy, dysarthria, and hypoesthesia. (sponsor's analysis, <ref type="table">Table S</ref>.6.7.2D1)</p><p>Based on the totality of the data, the reviewer believes that apixaban is unlikely to cause serious neurologic AE such as GBS, ALS or acute polyneuropathy. The Applicant appears to have done a good job identifying possible cases.  </p></div>

So one would not expect a large effect of renal impairment on PK, and certainly there is not one. However, it is known that subjects with renal impairment are inherently at risk for more adverse events, including bleeds and strokes. As stated earlier in Sec 7.3.2.1.6, most subjects with moderate to severe renal The data from APPRAISE-2 show that apixaban with an antiplatelet increases the risk of bleeding significantly <ref type="figure">(Figure 28)</ref>. For apixaban with single antiplatelet therapy, the annual rate of TIMI major bleeding is ~1.7 times greater than the rate of TIMI major bleeding in ARISTOTLE (0.96%/year, see <ref type="table">Table 88)</ref>, where apixaban was used alone. The TIMI major bleeding rate with dual antiplatelet therapy is 2.6 times greater than in ARISTOTLE. For ISTH major bleeding, the rate of bleeding on apixaban plus single antiplatelet therapy is almost 3 times greater and with dual antiplatelet therapy is 6 times greater than in ARISTOTLE where apixaban was used alone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 28 APPRAISE-2 -Risk of bleeding on apixaban and antiplatelet</head><p>Reviewer's analysis Cox proportional hazards with stratification by type of antiplatelet therapy: \appraise2\runs bleed, forestplot, Applicant's dataset adbs. HR=apixaban/placebo, n=number of events, N=number in each group, TIMI major bleed was the primary safety endpoint.</p><p>Reviewer's comment: The patient population in APPRAISE-2 and ARISTOTLE was different. But there certainly may be subjects with AFib that also have ischemic heart disease, and therefore may need both an anticoagulant and an antiplatelet drug. One would have to weigh the risk versus the benefit. Interestingly, the rate of bleeding (TIMI major and ISTH major) on apixaban plus single antiplatelet therapy in APPRAISE-2 was similar to the rate of bleeding on warfarin in ARISTOTLE. So in patients that need an anticoagulant and an antiplatelet it may be reasonable to use apixaban with a single antiplatelet. The rate of bleeding with apixaban and dual antiplatelet drugs is very worrisome; that coupled with the unknown risk:benefit ratio makes the reviewer even less enthusiastic about their combined use in AFib. The reviewer thinks extreme caution should be used when contemplating the combined use of apixaban with dual antiplatelet therapy. Stronger consideration should be given to the use of apixaban with a single antiplatelet treatment (as opposed to dual antiplatelet treatment) because of the higher risk of bleeding. The Applicant recommends that "a careful assessment of the potential benefits against the potential risks be made before combining" apixaban with any antiplatelet (single or dual). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.6.1">Human Carcinogenicity</head><p>Reviewer attempts to get an accurate assessment of types of cancer were difficult due to the problem with the AE dataset identified in Sec (events on same date were listed as both serious and non-serious. Of the few cases checked, it appears that the higher MedDRA hierarchy terms (HLT and HLGT) were correctly mapped twice, so if one were only interested in cancers that were SAEs then an accurate account might be possible).</p><p>A gross look of cancers just by subject shows no imbalance suggestive of apixaban being carcinogenic. Note that the cancer could have been a reoccurrence. The table merely shows the number of subjects that had an AE of cancer in ARISTOTLE. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.6.2">Human Reproduction and Pregnancy Data</head><p>Apixaban has not been studied in pregnant or lactating women. Studies in animals suggest that apixaban does not affect fertility or fetal development; an appreciable amount was excreted in the milk.</p><p>The summary of safety reports 1 pregnancy in a subject (CV185030-518-4629) who received apixaban 5 mg BID in ARISTOTLE. She was a 32 year old Caucasian with a relevant history of using an intra-uterine contraceptive device, positive pregnancy test on Day 119, apixaban discontinuation on Day 113. Her child was reported as a normal newborn delivered by cesarean section. There were no other reported pregnancies in Phase 2/3 AFib studies.</p><p>In short-term studies for VTE prevention or treatment there was one pregnancy reported in a subject (CV185061-1-2) after one day of apixaban. The subject discontinued from the study and the investigator reported that her pregnancy resulted in a live, normal birth at 40 weeks gestation. There was a pregnancy reported in the female partner of a 48 year old male subject receiving apixaban in CV185017. Her pregnancy outcome was not reported.</p><p>In ongoing blinded VTE prevention Phase 3 studies, there were a total of 8 reported pregnancies. The outcomes were 2 normal newborns, 3 induced abortions, 2 spontaneous abortions, and 1 unknown. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.6.4">Overdose, Drug Abuse Potential, Withdrawal and Rebound</head><p>In ARISTOTLE, there were 38 cases of overdose reported in 35 subjects on apixaban; overdose was either from study drug or concomitant nonstudy medications. Four of these subjects had overdoses during the 30 day post-treatment period. Overdose was reported as an SAE in 28 cases. Only 2 events led to treatment discontinuation. In AVERROES, there were 5 cases of overdose reported in 4 subjects in the apixaban group. Four of these cases were SAEs and one led to treatment discontinuation. All events resolved. There is no pharmacological treatment to reverse the effects of apixaban. Activated charcoal given up to 3 hours, in dog studies, increased the clearance of apixaban, so activated charcoal may be considered. The Applicant recommends that in the event of hemorrhagic complications, treatment be discontinued, the source of bleeding investigated, and appropriate supportive treatment be initiated (e.g. surgical hemostats or the transfusion of FFP).</p><p>There was no evidence suggesting drug abuse/dependence on apixaban.</p><p>There is an increase in thrombotic events following cessation of apixaban; strokes/se as well as major bleeds were higher in the apixaban arm than in the warfarin arm. Since most of the events occurred 14 days after apixaban discontinuation, the reviewer thought that this might be the inability to properly transition subjects onto warfarin and achieve therapeutic INR range. However, this hypothesis does not hold given the data in AVERROES. It is unclear why there were more bleeding events after apixaban cessation. Rivaroxaban, another Factor Xa inhibitor was associated with an increase in thrombotic events after drug discontinuation; the label has a black box warning. We are recommending a similar black box warning be included in apixaban's label, if it were to be approved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.7">Additional Submissions / Safety Issues</head><p>The safety profile for apixaban is consistent between the SUR (Safety Update Report) and the SCS (Summary of Clinical Safety). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.7.1">Data regarding adjudication of major bleed and MI</head><p>The reviewer analyzed the concordance between the investigator's assessment of the adverse event, major bleed and MI, and the final adjudication in attempts to identify any potential bias favoring apixaban. Since the investigator did not assess the type of bleed, the reviewer asked the Applicant to program the type (minor, CRNM, and major) of investigator reported bleed by using the ISTH definition and CRF S4 (Suspected Bleeding Endpoints page), filled out by the investigator. The reviewer compared the events that were "downgraded" and "upgraded" between both arms.</p><p>There appears to be reasonable adjudication (concurrence, downgrade, and upgrade) between investigator reported bleeds and adjudicated bleeds in both arms. It does not appear that there were more downgrades in the apixaban arm compared to the warfarin arm or that there were considerably more investigator reported bleeds in the warfarin arm that were adjudicated "down" compared to the apixaban arm. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attachment 4 ARISTOTLE -Special Dosing Procedures</head><p>Elective Procedures (copied from the protocol)</p><p>In general, local standards of care for discontinuation of anticoagulation prior to elective procedures/surgery should be employed; these may be informed by current guidelines. These are summarized below based upon the risk of thromboembolism:</p><p>Low risk of thromboembolism Subjects receiving warfarin should be managed according to the local standard of care. The anticoagulant effects of warfarin will be reflected in the PT and INR and, after discontinuation, will take several days (3 -5) to return to normal. Warfarin can be reversed more quickly by giving oral or intravenous vitamin K (depending on circumstances and the local standard of care) and/or with fresh frozen plasma (FFP).</p><p>For subjects receiving apixaban, the risk of bleeding with invasive procedures is unknown. At therapeutic doses, the anticoagulant effects of apixaban will not be reflected in standard coagulation tests; there is no reversal agent for apixaban. Vitamin K and protamine sulfate are not expected to affect the anticoagulant effect of apixaban, and may carry some risk. Given its half-life (12 hours), however, the anticoagulant effect of apixaban abates in 24 -48 hours. Depending on the subject's risk of bleeding with the procedure, subjects receiving apixaban who require an invasive or surgical procedure within 24 hours of their last dose may be treated with prophylactic peri-procedural FFP (2 units IV every 6 hours) at the discretion of the local physician and investigator.</p><p>If treatment with an alternative open label anticoagulant/antithrombotic is indicated for the procedure, it should be used at the lowest therapeutic dose (if at all) in the 12 hours following last dose of apixaban. Interactions between apixaban and other antithrombotics (with the exception of aspirin and clopidogrel) have not been evaluated.</p><p>Several figures depicting bridging strategies for patients undergoing invasive procedures were provided: Cardioversion, both spontaneous and as the result of medical intervention, is an important clinical issue for subjects with atrial fibrillation. Many of the subjects randomized to the study will spontaneously convert to and from atrial fibrillation during the trial, often on more than one occasion. It is important to assess the effectiveness of apixaban as compared to warfarin in preventing stroke in these subjects, and in subjects in whom cardioversion is induced either electrically or by the use of an antiarrhythmic drug. In general, subjects entered in the trial should receive blinded oral anticoagulation with therapeutic INRs for at least 3 weeks prior to undertaking elective cardioversion (either electrical or chemical) as is recommended in current guidelines.</p><p>In certain subjects at higher risk for left atrial or left atrial appendage thrombus, transesophageal echocardiography may be a useful adjuvant in guiding clinical decision making. Suspected events for review will be identified ("triggered") by an electronic and manual review of the clinical data captured on the CRF. The initial set of "triggers" described in this document, are based on exclusive review of the trial protocol, CRF, and general CEC experience in prior trials. However, the development of clinical trial "triggers" is best viewed as an iterative process. If potential changes in the triggers are identified after events have been reviewed, the triggers may be revised during the course of the trial.</p><p>Notes: â€¢ All Suspected Events will be triggered at randomization and until the trial ends.</p><p>â€¢ Events that occur prior to randomization should not trigger for adjudication. â€¢ Triggers will be programmed in a hierarchical order as described by the conditions below.</p></div>
