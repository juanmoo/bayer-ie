<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Explanation of Need for Clinical Review Amendment</head><p>This document is an addendum to a clinical review completed and finalized in DARRTS on November 20, 2013.</p><p>The original clinical review stated that the Applicant adequately demonstrated the efficacy of vedolizumab and that the benefit of vedolizumab outweighs its potential risks for adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. However outstanding issues related to vedolizumab for ulcerative colitis remained at that time, including:</p><p> The key safety issue was the potential risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). There was uncertainty about the adequacy of the safety database to provide an acceptable pre-marketing assessment of this risk of PML or if continued risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS) are needed in the postmarketing setting. This was to be discussed at an Advisory Committee Meeting on December 9, 2013.  Although a relationship between concomitant immunosuppressive therapies with infections was not found, there remained the concern that the risk of infections and of PML might be higher with concomitant immunosuppressive therapies. In the vedolizumab trials, these considerations led to the requirement that concomitant immunosuppressants were not allowed beyond the induction phase in the US trials. The review team questioned whether the labeling should have similar restrictions. This was to be discussed at an Advisory Committee Meeting on December 9, 2013.  Similarly, due to the potential risk for PML, vedolizumab use was limited to patients who failed immunomodulator or TNFα antagonist therapy in US trials, whereas outside the US prior corticosteroid failure was sufficient for inclusion. The review team questioned if vedolizumab should be indicated only for those patients who failed immunomodulator and/or TNFα antagonist therapy, or if prior corticosteroid failure should be sufficient. This was to be discussed at an Advisory Committee Meeting on December 9, 2013.</p><p> A small number of potential cases of drug related liver injury were reported and this information became known to the review team at the time of the 120-day Safety Update. Additional information was forthcoming from the Applicant at the time of the original clinical review.</p><p>Since the original clinical review was finalized, a joint meeting of the Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee (GIDAC) and Drug Safety and Risk Management (DSaRM) Advisory Committee was held to discuss the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab and the postmarket risk management strategy. In addition, the clinical site inspections were completed, and the Applicant provided more detailed information on 4 potential cases of drug induced liver injury, as well as updated PML and exposure data.</p><p>These updates to the original clinical review are summarized below with an updated risk/benefit assessment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Recommendations/Risk Benefit Assessment a. Recommendation on Regulatory Action</head><p>It is the recommendation of this reviewer that vedolizumab be approved for the indication of:</p><p>inducing and maintaining clinical response and remission, improving endoscopic appearance of the mucosa, and achieving corticosteroid-free remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) blocker or immunomodulator; or had an inadequate response with, were intolerant to, or demonstrated dependence on corticosteroids.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>b. Risk Benefit Assessment</head><p>Moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) is a serious chronic disease which has a substantial impact on patients' quality of life. There are available treatments for moderate to severe disease; however limitations exist, and many patients are unable to achieve sustained remission while other patients develop intolerance to or side effects from their current treatment regimens. Additional treatment options for patients with moderately to severely active UC, particularly those who have failed prior anti-TNF therapy, is needed.</p><p>Review of the Application and considering recommendations from the Advisory Committee, this reviewer believes that the benefit of vedolizumab in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis outweighs the risks associated with the use of the drug product, in patients who have failed immunomodulators, TNFα antagonists, or corticosteroids. The applicant has adequately characterized the potential risk of PML with vedolizumab to support approval and concomitant immunosuppressants should not be limited to a specific duration in clinical practice. Given the potential risk for PML, as well as the risk for serious infections and drug induced liver injury, a postmarketing observational study should be required, as well as enhanced pharmacovigilance in the postmarketing setting. In addition, these risks should be adequately included in the labeling.</p><p>3</p><p>Reviewer Comments: On December 9, 2013, the Advisory Committee met and supported the approval of vedolizumab for UC and CD based on the evidence of efficacy and safety. The majority of the AC members agreed that the benefits outweigh the risks to support the approval for the proposed UC population that have failed corticosteroids, as well as immunosuppressants or TNF α-antagonists and commented that restrictions would be burdensome in clinical practice. The committee agreed that concomitant immunosuppressants should not be limited to a specific duration. The review team agreed with the AC recommendations, and this is reflected in the indication and labeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>c. Recommendations for Postmarket Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies</head><p>A REMS is not required for this application because it is believed that the benefits of vedolizumab outweigh the risks for the intended population.</p><p>Reviewer Comments: On December 9, 2013, the Advisory Committee met and agreed that the applicant has adequately characterized the potential risk of PML with vedolizumab with the current data to support approval. Members noted that further quantification of this potential risk and continued monitoring and observation are still necessary and stressed that any risk mitigation strategies required beyond labeling to manage the potential risk of PML should not be overly burdensome for prescribers.</p><p>On February 3, 2014 the REMS Oversight Committee (ROC) met to discuss whether a REMS should be required for vedolizumab to mitigate the potential risk for PML. Updated exposure data were provided by the applicant through December 27, 2013 which indicated that zero cases of PML have been reported in the vedolizumab clinical development program, out of 3326 subjects exposed. This included 1056 patients who received 24 or more months of vedolizumab, ruling out a risk of PML of 2.8/1000 patients exposed for 24 or more months (with 95% confidence based on the Rule of 3). The review team recommended to the ROC that a REMS was not needed because the benefits of vedolizumab outweigh the risks for the intended population and for the following reasons:  UC and CD cause substantial morbidity and decreased quality of life.  Current treatment options do not adequately address medical needs in the subset of UC and CD patients who fail other therapies.  Vedolizumab has robust efficacy as a treatment for UC.  Vedolizumab has a potential risk of PML, as well as risks of hepatotoxicity, serious infections and malignancies. However: o Vedolizumab has a targeted mechanism of action against the human lymphocyte integrin α4β7 in contrast to <ref type="bibr">Tysabri (α4β1 &amp; α4β7)</ref>. o The nonclinical evidence does not support an association between the drug and PML. o No cases of PML have been identified in the clinical trials. o The risk of PML has been characterized to an upper bound of 2.8/1000 based on the number patients with 2 or more years of vedolizumab exposure and the fact that no cases of PML have arisen to date.  Labeling is sufficient to mitigate the potential risk of PML based on currently available evidence. Additionally, the Applicant will communicate the potential risk of PML through a Dear Healthcare Professional Letter and Healthcare Professional Brochure. FDA will also publish a Perspectives Piece in the New 6 A Joint Meeting of the Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee (GIDAC) and Drug Safety and Risk Management (DSaRM) Advisory Committee to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous vedolizumab for the induction and maintenance of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and the postmarket risk management strategy was held on December 9, 2013.</p><p>The following recommendations and responses were provided by the expert committee, in response to the 4 questions relevant to the ulcerative colitis indication:  The committee voted 21 to 0 that the applicant adequately characterized the potential risk of PML with vedolizumab to support approval. Members noted that continued quantification of this potential risk and monitoring and observation are still necessary.  The committee voted 19 to 1, with 1 abstention, that if vedolizumab is approved, concomitant immunosuppressants should not be limited to a specific duration (e.g., during induction only).  Thirteen (13) of 21 committee members voted that the proposed UC population should include patients that have failed corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or TNFα-antagonists, while the remaining 8 committee members voted that the proposed indications should require that patients have failed immunosuppressants or TNFα-antagonists only (i.e., failure of corticosteroids only would not be sufficient).  When asked what post-market risk mitigation strategies beyond labeling, if any, would be needed to ensure that the product's benefits outweigh its risks, the committee members commented that it is important to quantify the PML risks and to monitor other infections in addition to PML. Members stressed that postmarket risk mitigation strategies should not be burdensome for the practitioners.</p><p>Reviewer Comments: The review team agreed with the committee's recommendations to not limit the use of concomitant immunosuppressants and to include patients who have failed corticosteroids in the indication. The review team also agreed that the applicant adequately characterized the potential risk of PML with vedolizumab to support approval. While the committee did not vote on post-market risk mitigation strategies, members noted that continued quantification of this potential risk, monitoring and observation are still necessary and stressed that any risk mitigation strategies required beyond labeling to manage the potential risk of PML should not be overly burdensome for prescribers. Subject: Vedolizumab AC presentation, <ref type="bibr">December 9, 2013</ref> I have been asked to comment briefly on a hepatotoxicity signal that was observed in clinical trials associated with vedolizumab to help prepare for an impending presentation this week by Dr. Muldowney to the AC that is being convened to consider approval of this agent for the treatment of UC and Chrohn's disease. My suggested edits to the planned text for slides 89-97 to be presented at the AC are provided as a follow-up to our discussion. The corresponding edited power points are in the attached slide set.</p><p>'Natalizumab is associated with liver injury, including serious drug-induced liver injury, and this is included in the natalizumab label. The mechanism of action for DILI with Tysabri is not fully understood, however treatment with other biologic agents that modulate T cell activity has resulted in a variety of forms of liver injury -one hypothesis is that drugs which affect t-cell migration also could potentially cause liver injury through perturbation of regulatory or suppressor T cells, especially in individuals with pre-existing susceptibility to develop an auto-immune diathesis.</p><p>There were cases of liver injury, including serious liver injury with vedolizumab use during the clinical development program, so I will provide you with some of those details.</p><p>There were no imbalances of liver test abnormalities between treatment groups in phase 3 trials, and there were also no clear differences in rates of marked abnormalities of relevant lab parameters, between treatment groups (though the numbers were small, so comparisons are limited) during these controlled trials. I do want to highlight a few cases of vedolizumab-associated liver injury, however, which occurred during vedolizumab clinical development.</p><p>There were, however several cases of acute hepatocellular injury during the vedolizumab clinical development program.</p><p>Specifically, 4 patients reported serious adverse events of hepatitis during the controlled and open-label extension study. These adverse events occurred after a range of vedolizumab exposure, from 2 to 35 doses. All of these patients discontinued study drug and were treated with corticosteroids, and all recovered. There is, of course, a spectrum of plausibility in terms of relationship to drug. I provide some additional details on what we considered to be the most compelling case with the next slide, but wanted to first just give some very high level information on the other 3 cases, which we felt were less likely to be related to vedolizumab, but of course, that can't be ruled out entirely with the information we have.</p><p>The most recent case was reported a few weeks ago during the 120-day safety update. This was a 36 year female who developed hepatitis after 35 doses of vedolizumab, so it would be less likely to be related to vedolizumab alone, first off because of the duration of exposure before experiencing the AE. Subsequently this patient was diagnosed with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and while her liver tests began normalizing after discontinuation of vedolizumab and introduction of corticosteroids, she was continuing to have some elevations in liver functions several months after discontinuing treatment.</p><p>The next case was a 35 year old female who developed hepatitis 41 days after her second dose of vedolizumab, so there is more temporal plausibility here, however, she had started sulfasalazine several months before the trial, and her symptoms with fever, labs with marked eosinophilia, and biopsy results were more consistent with an allergic reaction to sulfasalazine, rather than vedolizumab-induced liver injury. Of course, vedolizumab, as a cause, cannot be entirely ruled out.</p><p>The next case was a 23 year old female who developed hepatitis 13 days after her 2 nd dose of drug. This case was highly confounded, however, as the patient was hospitalized with pneumonia and a number of medications were started before the event.</p><p>The most compelling case was a 20-year old male patient from Italy who experienced acute hepatocellular injury which occurred after his 5 th dose of vedolizumab. He was diagnosed with UC 7 years before entering the study and had been previously treated with AZA/6-MP, infliximab, mesalamine, and corticosteroids, however, all UC treatments except 5 mg daily prednisone were discontinued before study entry. With normal baseline serum liver tests, he received his 1 st dose of vedolizumab on with a 5 th and final dose on about 3 months later. At that time, he was found to have new elevations of his liver serum transaminases. He was asymptomatic and the transaminase levels were then monitored on a weekly basis -I didn't include the labs on this slide, however, they remained elevated in the same range as the labs 4 days later on -A liver biopsy and ultrasound showed a pattern consistent with either drug-induced or autoimmune hepatitis, and 7 weeks later on with a further rise of the transaminases and a rising total bilirubin level that reached 20 micromol/liter, near the upper limit of normal, he was hospitalized with acute hepatitis and started treatment with IV corticosteroids.</p><p>As you can see, the labs were his peak values. He was discharged from the hospital a few days later and his lab work was normalizing. Follow up labs from February of the following year were normal. Based on the information reviewed, this case seems to have the highest probability of causality related to vedolizumab, of the cases seen.</p><p>As stated, there were cases of acute hepatocellular injury which occurred with vedolizumab use, one case in particular seemed probably related to drug treatment. There is mechanistic plausibility for such reactions since integrin antagonists have a potential to affect regulatory T cells that should ordinarily prevent autoimmune organ injury. With these findings, appropriate labeling, careful follow-up and expeditious evaluation of patients in the postmarketing setting will be needed.'</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary Comment:</head><p>These cases of acute hepatocellular liver injury associated with vedolizumab, some associated with autoimmune features that responded to de-challenge and prednisone raise a concern that some individuals have increased susceptibility to developing organ damage due to the immunomodulatory effects of this agent, some just after a few doses. The concern is supported by the documentation of similar cases of acute hepatotoxicity associated with natalizumab, a monoclonal agent with very similar Reference ID: 3443778</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6)</formula><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is a representation of an electronic record that was signed electronically and this page is the manifestation of the electronic signature.      It is the recommendation of this reviewer that vedolizumab be approved for the indication of: Achieving 1 clinical response and remission, and achieving corticosteroid-free remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to steroids or immunomodulators (such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate) or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Risk Benefit Assessment</head><p>Moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD) is a serious chronic disease which has a substantial impact on patients' quality of life. CD involves chronic inflammation of all layers of the bowel and may affect any segment of the GI tract. For CD, the most common patterns of GI involvement are in descending order, (1) the distal small intestine and colon, (2) the small intestine alone, and (3) the colon alone. Other treatment options in this population of moderately to severely active CD include corticosteroids, immunomodulators, TNFα-antagonists (infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab) and natalizumab. The number of patients that have received natalizumab for CD is very small (approximately 1,100). The natalizumab indication is limited to patients that have failed TNFα-antagonists.</p><p>Review of the current Application reveals that the benefit of vedolizumab for reducing signs and symptoms and achieving clinical remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease who have failed prior therapies has been adequately demonstrated, and the benefit outweighs the risks associated with the use of the drug product.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Induction and Maintenance Studies Results Summary</head><p>To support this indication, the applicant submitted two studies (C13007 and C13011) that evaluated vedolizumab 300 mg as therapy for moderate to severe Crohn's disease. Induction was evaluated in two trials; however, evaluation of maintenance was limited to one trial. Study C13007 evaluated both induction and "maintenance". Study C13011 evaluated only induction. In Study C13007 approximately 50% of subjects were naïve to TNFα antagonists and 50% patients had a history of "treatment failure" on TNFα antagonists. In contrast, the primary analysis population in Study C13011 was limited to patients who had failed previous TNFα antagonist therapy. These patients constituted approximately 75% of patients randomized in this trial. An additional 25% of patients in Study C13011 were naïve to TNFα antagonist therapy and were not included in the primary efficacy analysis. 13 Safety This Reviewer believes vedolizumab has been shown to be safe for its intended use as recommended in the labeling. Overall, the safety profile of vedolizumab was adequately characterized during the clinical development program. See Section 7.</p><p>Since 2007, the vedolizumab clinical development program included a Risk Assessment and Minimization for PML (RAMP) program. The RAMP program was thorough, and no cases of PML were identified through the 120 day safety data cutoff. This included 903 patients exposed to 24 or more vedolizumab infusions with 4-weeks of follow up and approximately 80% of whom received prior immunosuppressant therapy. Less than 1% of patients tested positive for JC viremia, and JCV antibody testing was not included in the RAMP program. There were 0 cases of PML identified during the vedolizumab clinical development program to date.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outstanding Issues</head><p>The Applicant adequately demonstrated the efficacy of vedolizumab and that the benefit of vedolizumab outweighs its potential risks for adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. Outstanding issues related to vedolizumab include:  The key safety issue is the potential risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Risk management strategies beyond labeling were discussed at the Advisory Committee on December 9, 2013; the Advisory Committee members commented that it is important to quantify PML risks and to monitor other infections in addition to PML. Members also noted that postmarket risk mitigation strategies should not be burdensome for the practitioners. Self-reported adverse events registries could also be considered. The final decision on this issue has not yet been made by the review team. (See Sections 1.3 and 9.3 of this review.)  Two potential cases of drug related liver injury were reported. Additional information is forthcoming from the Applicant. Enhanced pharmacovigilance in the postmarketing setting may be needed to ensure any future cases are captured.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Recommendations for Postmarket Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies</head><p>The primary serious risk of harm relevant to REMS considerations is the potential risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an opportunistic viral infection of the brain that usually leads to death or severe disability. Natalizumab, an integrin antagonist approved in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease, is associated with an increased risk for PML. No cases of PML have been reported in the vedolizumab clinical development program, out of 3326 patients exposed, however a theoretical risk remains. 15</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Recommendations for Postmarket Requirements and Commitments</head><p>At the time of this review, the following Postmarket Requirements and Commitments are recommended:</p><p>The Clinical Pharmacology review team recommends the following post marketing commitment (PMC) studies:  A study to reanalyze banked immunogenicity serum samples from ulcerative colitis trial C13006 and Crohn's disease trial C13007 to determine the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) using an improved ADA assay format with reduced sensitivity to product interference. This recommendation is based on the finding of inadequate assessment of immunogenicity incidence in the current BLA.  Evaluate the disease-drug-drug interaction (DDDI) potential between vedolizumab and other CYP substrates. This recommendation is based on the current understanding that CYP enzymes expression is suppressed by inflammatory cytokines associated with inflammatory conditions, and they can normalize upon improvement of the inflammatory conditions. We recommend a step-wise approach. For instance, one can conduct a study to first define the impact of UC or CD, an inflammatory disease condition, on the exposure of CYP substrate drugs (i.e., the disease drug interaction). Such study may involve evaluating the exposures of CYP substrate drugs in healthy subjects and in subjects with severe UC or CD disease. In the event that the disease drug interaction is deemed clinically meaningful, the impact of vedolizumab treatment on observed disease drug interaction as measured by the exposure of CYP substrate drugs can be further evaluated in a subsequent study to evaluate the DDDI.</p><p>The following study is recommended from the Pediatric and Maternal Health Staff as a PMC:  Conduct a milk-only lactation trial in lactating women receiving vedolizumab therapeutically to assess concentrations of vedolizumab in breast milk using a validated assay in order to appropriately inform the Nursing Mother's subsection of labeling</p><p>The PREA postmarketing requirement (PMR) for CD is described below:  The applicant has requested a Waiver of Pediatric Study for pediatric patients from birth to and a Deferral of Pediatric Study for pediatric patients to &lt; 18.  We generally have waived requirements for pediatric studies of CD treatments in children under the age of 6 years due to the low CD incidence in that age group. The final determination of pediatric waiver and deferral will be made upon presentation to the Pediatric Research Committee (PeRC) as part of the review of this BLA for moderately to severely active CD in adults.</p><p>This Reviewer recommends the following PMC:</p><p>Reference ID: 3428850</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(b) (4) (b) (4)</formula><p> A randomized controlled trial to evaluate induction of clinical remission at Week 10 after a dose of vedolizumab 300 mg at Weeks 0, 2, and 6. Tysabri contains a boxed warning that it increases the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an opportunistic viral infection of the brain that usually leads to death or severe disability. Cases of PML have been reported in patients taking Tysabri who were recently or concomitantly treated with immunomodulators or immunosuppressants, as well as in patients receiving Tysabri as monotherapy.</p><p>As per the current label for Tysabri, three factors that are known to increase the risk of PML in Tysabri-treated patients have been identified: In addition to increasing the risk of PML, hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred in patients receiving Tysabri and were more frequent in patients with antibodies to Tysabri. Tysabri may also increase the risk for infections, including urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and gastroenteritis.</p><p>At the time of approval for CD, one of the post-marketing commitments (PMCs) was for a prospective observational study (CD INFORM) that specified that at least 2,000 CD patients must be enrolled, and that a least 1,000 patients must have two years of Tysabri treatment. CD INFORM was designed primarily to determine the incidence and pattern of serious and/or clinically significant infections, malignancies, and other serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) treated with natalizumab; the main safety outcome of interest in CD INFORM is PML. At the time of this review, the accrual of the study has been limited by the use of the marketed product in CD, and a total of only 187 subjects have been enrolled. Additional data is not yet available. confirmed PML in patients receiving the drug to treat MS and one reported case in a patient treated for Crohn's disease. All integrin antagonists under development in the US at that time were placed on clinical hold. The clinical hold on IND 009,125 was lifted in July 2007 with the implementation of an active screening and monitoring program. Multiple subsequent regulatory meetings, including an Advisory Committee (AC) meeting, have focused on risk minimization and safety monitoring related to potential PML risk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Summary of Presubmission Regulatory Activity Related to Submission</head><p>A Joint Meeting of the Gastrointestinal Advisory Committee (GIDAC) and the Drug Safety and Risk Management (DSaRM) Advisory Committee to evaluate intravenous vedolizumab for treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (induction and maintenance of Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis) and the risk of PML was held on July 20, 2011. The purpose of this closed session Advisory committee was to seek the committee's recommendations regarding the Phase 3 study design for vedolizumab, including the number of patients and duration of study needed to exclude the risk of PML. The following recommendations and responses were provided by the expert committee, in response to 4 questions:</p><p> The committee voted 12 to 5, with one abstention, that the available nonclinical and human pharmacodynamic data for vedolizumab do not provide assurance of less risk of PML than natalizumab.  The committee commented on an acceptable safety database size for preapproval assessment of PML risk in patients with CD and UC. No consensus was reached, however, the AC strongly expressed that the duration of exposure is important and that 24 months could be considered as the minimum duration timeframe. The majority of the committee felt that increasing the sample size has merit.  The committee voted 15 to 2, with one abstention, that the available nonclinical and clinical data do not support making the entry criteria less stringent for vedolizumab phase 3 studies (i.e., allow entry of patients that have not yet been treated with TNFα antagonists or immunosuppressants).  The committee voted 17 to 0, with one abstention, that restrictions on concomitant immunosuppressants (prohibited beyond the induction phase of vedolizumab treatment) should not be made less stringent.</p><p>Based on the AC recommendations and over the course of several meetings between the sponsor and FDA, the following major agreements were made relating to the risk of PML with this class of therapy:  patient screening and monitoring: a screening baseline neurologic exam with exclusion of those with abnormal findings, education of site personnel and patients, and updated informed consent documents  selection criteria: patients enrolled in phase 3 studies were required to meet the stricter requirement of inadequate response or intolerance to immunosuppressants or TNFα antagonists, rather than immunosuppressants, TNFα antagonists, or corticosteroids  concomitant medications: patients in phase 3 studies were allowed concomitant steroid use for one and one-half years, with tapering at week 6 in patients that are in clinical response, or when clinical response is achieved. In addition, concomitant immunosuppressant use was allowed for up to 6 weeks in Phase 3 studies, but must be otherwise prohibited.  safety database: the safety database at the time of original BLA submission must include data on at least 900 patients that received ≥ 24 infusions, with a minimum of 4 weeks of follow-up after the last infusion</p><p>It should be noted that the Division only reviewed the US versions of the protocols. Some of the above protocol provisions, most notably restrictions on entry and restrictions on concomitant immunosuppressive therapies, are not part of the protocols outside the US.</p><p>Several formal meetings also occurred between the sponsor and FDA to discuss manufacturing changes. Vedolizumab was initially manufactured utilizing a mouse myeloma (NS0) cell line, and initial clinical studies used drug product from this process (MLN02, Process A). A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line was developed to improve productivity, and drug product from this process (MLN0002, Process B) was used in multiple Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies. Further manufacturing improvements to the CHO-based process were then implemented to establish a commercially representative process (MLN0002, Process C) that was used to supply Phase 3 clinical trials. A PK/PD comparability study was completed prior to initiating Phase 3 studies, to compare Process B and C products. For simplicity, vedolizumab will be used throughout this review to refer to the drug product throughout its development.</p><p>Presubmission regulatory activities related to this submission included an advisory committee meeting and 14 formal face-to-face meetings between the sponsor and FDA. In addition, there were a number of teleconferences and written correspondences exchanged during the development program for Crohn's disease. The sponsor was granted Fast Track Designation in February 2013. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref> below summarizes presubmission regulatory meetings and submissions and highlights key clinical agreements.</p><p>In vitro studies also demonstrated that vedolizumab did not mediate antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or complement dependent cytotoxicity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In addition, vedolizumab did not induce T lymphocyte activation or cytokine release. Tissue cross-reactivity studies were conducted using a panel of monkey and human tissues, and no unanticipated tissue cross reactivity was observed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In Vivo Pharmacology</head><p>An animal efficacy study was conducted in Tamarin monkeys with naturally occurring chronic colitis using ACT-1 (murine homologue of vedolizumab). ACT-1 treatment resulted in resolution of diarrhea in all animals by Day 3 and colonic mucosal biopsies on Day 5 showed ACT-1 localization to the α4β7 + lymphocytes in the lamina propria. Biopsy results also revealed reduced mucosal density of α4β7 + lymphocytes from Day 5 to Day 20. Control animals had no clinical or immunohistologic improvement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Toxicology</head><p>Toxicity studies were conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys. Lymphoplasmacytic gastritis was observed in both MLN0002 and control monkeys in a 26-week study, though MLN0002 treated monkeys had greater regeneration of superficial mucosal epithelium in response to this gastritis. The significance of this is not known. Balantidium coli (parasites) were observed in the cecum and colon of both control and vedolizumab treated monkeys, and no dose response in vedolizumab treated monkeys was observed.</p><p>In a 3-month toxicity study of New Zealand white rabbits, no differences were noted between control animals and those treated with vedolizumab. A reproduction study in pregnant New Zealand white rabbits showed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus with vedolizumab administration on gestation day 7 at single IV doses up to 100 mg/kg. Similarly, a pre and postnatal development study with vedolizumab in monkeys showed no evidence of any adverse effect on pre and postnatal development at IV doses up to 100 mg/kg.</p></div>

The sponsor conducted a study using an Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in Rhesus monkeys (a model of multiple sclerosis; there is no animal model of PML) to assess the impact of vedolizumab and natalizumab on CNS immune surveillance. The results of this study showed that while natalizumab appeared to inhibit immune surveillance of the CNS, vedolizumab had no such effect.</p><p>In addition, a 3-week comparative immunotoxicity study of natalizumab and vedolizumab was completed in Cynomolgus monkeys. Natalizumab caused a 27 significant increase in lymphocyte populations (e.g., b-lymphocytes, t-helper lymphocytes, etc.), whereas there was no change in these populations in vedolizumabtreated monkeys.</p><p>There are no major efficacy or safety issues from nonclinical, which recommends approval.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Clinical Pharmacology</head><p>The Clinical Pharmacology review team found the information submitted to support this BLA to be acceptable with the following recommendations for post marketing commitment (PMC) studies:  A study to reanalyze banked immunogenicity serum samples from ulcerative colitis trial C13006 and Crohn's disease trial C13007 to determine the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) using an improved ADA assay format with reduced sensitivity to product interference. This recommendation is based on the finding of inadequate assessment of immunogenicity incidence in the current BLA.  Evaluate the disease-drug-drug interaction (DDDI) potential between vedolizumab and other CYP substrates. This recommendation is based on the current understanding that CYP enzymes expression is suppressed by inflammatory cytokines associated with inflammatory conditions, and they can normalize upon improvement of the inflammatory conditions. We recommend a step-wise approach. For instance, one can conduct a study to first define the impact of UC or CD, an inflammatory disease condition, on the exposure of CYP substrate drugs (i.e., the disease drug interaction). Such study may involve evaluating the exposures of CYP substrate drugs in healthy subjects and in subjects with severe UC or CD disease. In the event that the disease drug interaction is deemed clinically meaningful, the impact of vedolizumab treatment on observed disease drug interaction as measured by the exposure of CYP substrate drugs can be further evaluated in a subsequent study to evaluate the DDDI.</p><p>Additional summary information from the clinical pharmacology review is provided below. For more detailed information see the Clinical Pharmacology Review by Lanyan Fang, PhD, Yow-Ming Wang, PhD, Justin Earp, PhD, Nitin Mehrotra PhD, Sarah Dorff, PhD, and Michael Pacanowski, PharmD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.1">Mechanism of Action</head><p>Vedolizumab is a recombinant humanized IgG1 antibody which selectively binds α4β7 integrin, a glycoprotein on the surface of leukocytes which are involved in GI mucosal immunity. Vedolizumab blocks the interaction of human lymphocyte integrin α4β7 with its ligand, mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), which is expressed on the endothelium of intestinal vasculature. This inhibits the migration of these leukocytes into the GI mucosa and thus decreases the inflammation associated with CD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.2">Pharmacodynamics</head><p>Study C13002 assessed the relationship between vedolizumab serum concentrations and the extent of α4β7 binding saturation in three dose cohorts (2, 6, and 10 mg/kg). Subjects received a total of 4 vedolizumab doses administered at Days 1, 14, 29, and 85. Maximum binding saturation (i.e., near 100% inhibition of MAdCAM-1-Fc binding to α4β7) occurred within one hour of vedolizumab administration at all dose levels, suggesting that maximum inhibition of α4β7 is unrelated to dose. Maximum inhibition persisted throughout treatment until 84, 126, and 112 days after the last dose for the 2, 6, and 10 mg/kg dose cohorts, respectively. The significance of the saturation of the α4β7 receptor is only one factor related to drug efficacy. These results suggest that near-maximum α4β7 binding will be maintained with the recommended dosing regimen of 300 mg Q8W.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.3">Pharmacokinetics</head><p>Vedolizumab exhibits target-mediated drug disposition leading to decreased clearance with increasing doses, due to target saturation. However, the exposure was approximately dose-proportional over the dose range of 2 to 10 mg/kg, following repeated dose administration in CD patients. The mean apparent terminal half-life was approximately 25 days at 300 mg dose. The population PK analysis showed disease severity, body weight, serum albumin, age, prior TNFα antagonist therapy, and concomitant medications had no clinically meaningful impact on PK.</p><p>The clinical pharmacology assessment found the proposed dosing regimen (i.e., 300 mg at Weeks 0, 2, 6 and Q8W thereafter) acceptable based on exposure response data. The exposure response analysis in Study C13007 was based on the ITT population, where the trough concentration was used as the exposure variable and clinical remission or enhanced clinical response at each of the timepoints (Weeks 6 and 52) were used as the primary response variables. No exposure-response relationships were evident between clinical remission or enhanced clinical response at either Week 6 or Week 52 and vedolizumab trough concentrations. The lack of exposure-response relationship at Week 52 is consistent with the lack of dose-response observed between the Q4W and Q8W dosing regimens at Week 52.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.4">Immunogenicity</head><p>The immunogenicity of vedolizumab could not be reliably assessed during clinical development due to drug interference in the immunogenicity assay. The drug tolerance level of the immunogenicity assay (500 ng/mL) was significantly less than the mean vedolizumab steady state trough concentrations during clinical trials, so the incidence of ADA were likely to be underestimated during treatment. For example, 4% of patients who received continuous vedolizumab in Studies C13006 and C13007 developed anti-drug antibodies at any time during treatment; however, 17% of patients who received vedolizumab during induction but placebo during the maintenance phase had ADAs at Week 52, when drug levels were undetectable. Since ADAs could degrade during this time period, 17% may still be an underestimation of the true immunogenicity rate. There were 8 patients with persistently positive ADA, and none of these patients achieved clinical remission at Weeks 6 or 52 in controlled trials. Seven of these subjects had available drug concentration data which showed undetectable vedolizumab concentrations in 5 patients and reduced vedolizumab concentrations in 2 patients. The review of efficacy focuses on the placebo-controlled trial C13007 (induction and maintenance) and C13011 (induction in a population with 75% TNFα failures).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Discussion of Individual Studies/Clinical Trials</head><p>The studies are discussed in detail in section 6. Here we will review inclusion/exclusion criteria and demographics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C13007 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</head><p>The study design of C13007 permitted double-blind placebo-controlled comparisons of safety parameters in the both the Induction Study and the Maintenance Study. Enrollment of the additional cohort of patients in the Induction Phase was to increase the number of patients contributing to the induction safety evaluations. In the Maintenance Phase, safety treatment comparisons could be made on all enrolled patients for the entire duration of the study (up to 52 weeks), as even patients initially treated with placebo and those who were non-responders to vedolizumab were to continue into the Maintenance Phase. Additional measures were to be taken to collect safety parameters in these patients beyond the 52-week duration of the trial. Patients who completed or withdrew from the Maintenance Phase may have been eligible for entry into a long-term safety study, C13008. Patients who did not participate in Study C13008 were to have a final visit 16 weeks after their final dose of study drug, and have safety information collected for up to 2 years after the study.</p><p>As vedolizumab-treated patients who did not achieve induction response were to be retained in the study after Week 6, the response to additional vedolizumab treatment could be evaluated in exploratory analyses, using a placebo group comparison.</p><p>The entry criteria were to ensure that patients who were appropriate for pharmacologic treatment, as assessed by severity of disease, were enrolled into the study. Entry criteria were also to exclude patients who might not benefit from drug or who might be at risk for treatment toxicities. Additional measures to ensure the safety of enrolled patients were to include protocol-mandated criteria for withdrawal in patients who had worsening of disease or required rescue medication. Thus, the protocol ensured that patients who could be treated with placebo (inactive treatment) up to 52 weeks were withdrawn from the study if they experienced treatment failure.</p><p>Detailed information was to be collected on prior treatments for CD, and patient response to prior treatments, including protocol-specified definitions for the type of treatment failure. Thus, both the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab could be assessed in the important subgroups of patients who were TNFα antagonist naïve and those who had prior treatment failure with these agents.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baseline Crohn's Disease Characteristics C13011 Induction</head><p>Consistent with the study's inclusion criteria, patients with moderately to severely active CD were enrolled, as demonstrated by the baseline disease characteristics of the treatment groups. In the Overall ITT Population, the mean duration of disease was 10.3 years, with the majority of the patients having been diagnosed for ≥7 years (57%). The mean baseline disease activity, as assessed by the baseline CDAI score, was statistically significantly higher in the vedolizumab group (313.9) than the placebo group (301.3), with 37% of vedolizumab-treated patients having a baseline CDAI score &gt; 330 compared with 29% of the placebo-treated patients. The majority of the patients had a baseline CRP &gt; 10 mg/L (50%), a baseline fecal calprotectin &gt; 500 μg/g (58%), and disease involvement of both the ileum and colon (61%). A history of prior surgery for CD was reported for 44% of the patients. The majority of the patients in both treatment groups had no history of fistulizing disease, and only 12% of the patients had a draining fistula at baseline. Extraintestinal manifestations of the disease were present at baseline in 59% of the patients. Most patients in both treatment groups had never smoked or were former smokers (70%). The baseline CD characteristics of the TNFα Antagonist Failure ITT Subpopulation were similar to those observed for the Overall ITT Population, except for disease duration and baseline CDAI score. The mean duration of disease was somewhat longer in the TNFα Antagonist Failure ITT Subpopulation, with 64% of the patients having been diagnosed for ≥ 7 years. The statistically significant difference between the treatment groups for mean baseline CDAI score observed in the Overall ITT Population was marginally significant in the TNF αAntagonist Failure ITT Subpopulation (306.1 placebo; 316.1 vedolizumab). This reviewer agrees with the applicant that the data suggest that for the population of patients who have failed TNFα antagonists it takes longer to achieve a treatment effect. The increased treatment differences from placebo at Week 10 compared to results at Week 6 in both the population who failed TNFα antagonists and the overall population suggest that an additional dose of vedolizumab and/or more time may be needed to induce remission in some patients. The applicant argues that pharmacologic inhibition of lymphocyte migration to the gut (the presumptive mode of action of vedolizumab) may require a longer timeframe for optimal induction in CD, where the inflammatory process is transmural as compared to UC where the inflammation is more superficial.</p><p>Results of the maintenance phase of Study C13007 showed that patients on vedolizumab who had shown a clinical response in the induction phase (decrease of CDAI by 70 points at week 6) had statistically higher rates of being in remission at week 52 than placebo patients. However, results for durable clinical remission (clinical remission in ≥ 80% of study visits) were not significant for the q 8 week dosing interval. A claim for "maintenance" may therefore be problematic; this reviewer recommends that the labeling avoid this term, instead describing the clinical trial findings (see Section 9.2).</p><p>The secondary endpoint of "corticosteroid-free remission" was met for the Q8W arm. "Corticosteroid-free remission" was defined as the proportion of patients that discontinued corticosteroids by Week 52 and were in clinical remission at Week 52 (in the subgroup of patients who were receiving corticosteroids at baseline and who were in clinical response at Week 6) (corticosteroid tapering began as soon as a clinical response was achieved). Also, in an exploratory analysis, the applicant showed that with respect to corticosteroids, a greater percentage of patients treated with vedolizumab compared to placebo were in remission at Week 52 and had been off corticosteroids for at least 90 and at least 180 days.</p><p>The data of the maintenance phase of C13007 appeared internally consistent as demonstrated across efficacy endpoints in multiple predefined subgroup analyses according to demographic factors, disease activity and previous treatments for CD for maintenance. No single site contributed more than 5% of patients and thus could not contribute disproportionately to the observed treatment effects. Approximately 21% of patients in the C13007 Maintenance Study were enrolled at sites in the US and internal consistency regarding effectiveness across different geographical areas was demonstrated in subgroup analyses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C13007 -Induction Phase</head><p>In the Induction Study ITT Population, a total of 23 patients (8 placebo; 15 vedolizumab) had at least 1 unmet entry criterion. The most common deviations were failure to meet the inclusion criterion for baseline CDAI score of 220 to 450 with either a CRP level &gt; 2.87 mg/L, a minimum of 3 nonanastomotic ulcerations or 10 aphthous ulcerations consistent with CD, or a fecal calprotectin &gt; 250 μg/g with appropriate imaging (3 placebo; 4 vedolizumab); CD diagnosis of at least 3 months confirmed by histology or of at least 6 months based on other supporting evidence if histology report not available (0 placebo; 4 vedolizumab); and inadequate or lost response/intolerance of steroids, immunomodulators, and/or TNFα antagonists (1 placebo; 3 vedolizumab). An additional 63 patients in the open label vedolizumab group had violations of inclusion/exclusion criteria, primarily failure to meet the inclusion criterion for baseline CDAI score. No notable trends were observed for the treatment groups with respect to inclusion/exclusion criteria deviations.</p><p>In the Maintenance Study ITT Population, a total of 32 patients (8 placebo, 12 vedolizumab Q8W, and 12 vedolizumab Q4W) failed to meet at least 1 study entry criterion. The most common deviations across the treatment groups were failure to meet the inclusion criteria for baseline CDAI score of 220 to 450, with either a CRP level &gt; 2.87 mg/L, a minimum of 3 non-anastomotic ulcerations or 10 aphthous ulcerations consistent with CD, or a fecal calprotectin &gt; 250 μg/g with appropriate imaging (placebo 57 2%; vedolizumab Q8W 4%; vedolizumab Q4W 2%); inadequate or lost response/intolerance of steroids, immunomodulators, and/or TNFα antagonists (placebo &lt; 1%; vedolizumab Q8W 1%; vedolizumab Q4W 3%); and met the exclusion criterion of C. difficile infection or other intestinal pathogen within 28 days of study entry (placebo 1%; vedolizumab Q8W 1%; vedolizumab Q4W 3%).</p><p>All of the inclusion or exclusion criteria deviations occurred in ≤ 2% of the all vedolizumab combined group, as well as the non-ITT placebo group. There were few dropouts of any cause in the induction phase of study C13007. The reasons for discontinuation in the maintenance arm appeared to be balanced between placebo, VDZ q4 and q8 weeks.  Study C13007 was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of vedolizumab in patients with moderately to severely active CD, defined by CDAI of 220 to 450 points, and any of the following: serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration &gt; 2.87 mg/L, colonoscopy demonstrating ≥ 3 non-anastomotic ulcers or ≥ 10 aphthous ulcers, or fecal calprotectin concentration &gt; 250 mcg/g stool in conjunction with ulceration. The upper bound of 61 CDAI was modified from 480 to 450 when, approximately 6 months after study initiation, blinded review showed that the baseline disease activity scores from the first 50 patients were substantially higher than anticipated and not in alignment with the study objectives of including patients with moderately to severely active disease. The applicant states that the revised upper bound of 450 to define a study population with moderately to severely active disease is the same as that used in other registration studies for the approved TNFα antagonist therapies at the time of protocol development.</p><p>Eligible patients had to have failed treatment with conventional therapy (i.e., corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">8</ref> or TNFα antagonists. Immunomodulators were defined as 6-mercapotopurine (6-MP), azathioprine (AZA), and methotrexate (MTX). There was no limitation on the number of TNFα antagonists that a patient could have failed; at the time this study was conducted, patients could have failed up to 3 different TNFα antagonists, and failure was defined as inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance. Compared to other studies evaluating TNFα antagonist therapies, Study C13007 was different in its inclusion of patients with CD who had not responded to TNFα antagonist treatment (primary nonresponders). Because the applicant intends vedolizumab for a broad population of patients, enrollment of patients who had failed TNFα antagonist therapies was limited to approximately 50% of the ITT Induction and Maintenance populations.</p><p>Disease activity was measured using the CDAI. The sponsor recognized that the disease activity for the first 50 enrolled patients was higher than expected and therefore modified the protocol (amendment 6 to study C13007) by adding the endpoint of enhanced clinical response (defined as a decrease from baseline in CDAI of at least 100 points) at Week 6 primary to the primary efficacy endpoint of clinical remission (defined as CDAI ≤ 150) at Week 6 9 .</p><p>Other than the Hochberg method used to control Type I error for the primary induction endpoints, the same statistical approach for controlling Type I error in Study C13006 was used in Study C13007.</p><p>Study C13011: Consistent with its objective, patients in Study C13011 were primarily patients with CD who had failed prior TNFα antagonist therapy, and 75% of the patients could have failed up to 3 different TNFα antagonist therapies, thereby selecting a patient population that is difficult to treat and has limited to no treatment options. To support the efficacy of vedolizumab in the broader patient population, the study also enrolled patients who had not yet received TNFα antagonist therapy, but had previously failed treatment with corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators 10 . Like Study C13007, Study C13011 included patients with CD who had not responded to TNFα antagonist treatment (primary non-responders). Patients had moderately to severely active CD, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">8</ref> US trial participants had to have failed more than just corticosteroid treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">9</ref> These were not co-primary endpoint in the sense of a logical AND but two equally ranked endpoint (logical OR). defined by baseline CDAI between 220 and 450, consistent with registration studies for new CD therapies.</p><p>The rationale for stratification of randomization to control for confounding factors in Study C13011 was similar to that used in the Induction Phase of Study C13007. Stratification factors included previous failure of TNFα antagonist therapy or no previous treatment with TNFα antagonist therapy, concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, and concomitant use of immunomodulators.</p><p>Disease activity was measured using CDAI and the primary endpoint was defined as clinical remission at Week 6 in TNFα antagonist-failure patients. Based on blinded results from Study C13007, the sponsor hypothesized that a third induction dose or longer duration of dosing could increase the rate of clinical remission measured at 10 weeks. Therefore, an additional dose and increased length of assessment were chosen for evaluation as part of the secondary endpoints in Study C13011, which allowed for evaluation of remission at the Week 10 time point. It also permitted the evaluation of sustained effects of induction therapy.</p><p>The primary endpoint was tested using the CMH chi-square test at a 5% significance level with adjustment for the stratification factors. To maintain the overall Type I error rate at 5%, the secondary endpoint analyses were performed sequentially and only if the comparison for the previous secondary endpoint was significant.</p></div>

For the second primary endpoint of enhanced clinical response (CDAI-100) at Week 6 in the overall population, the treatment difference favored vedolizumab but was not statistically significant.

Further hypothesis testing of secondary endpoints is therefore exploratory. Remission rates were higher (with nominally significant p-values) compared with placebo at Week 10 following a third dose of vedolizumab in patients who failed TNFα antagonists. Similar results (with nominally significant p-values) were seen in the overall population in Study C13011, i.e., the treatment difference between vedolizumab and placebo was greater with vedolizumab at Week 6 and the difference increased at Week 10 following a third infusion. In Study C13011, continued remission for up to 4 weeks (i.e., remission at both Weeks 6 and 10) during induction was observed in greater proportions of vedolizumab-treated patients compared with placebo in both the overall (15.3% vs. 8.2%) and TNFα antagonist failure (12.0% vs. 8.3%) populations.

As previously remarked, patients on vedolizumab who had shown a clinical response in the induction phase (decrease of CDAI by 70 points at week 6) had statistically higher rates of being in remission at week 52 than placebo patients. However, results for durable clinical remission were not significant for the q 8 week dosing interval.

Authors of a consensus paper define the difference between alternative (logical OR) and coprimary (logical AND) as follows: "The word alternative is used to indicate that each primary endpoint is an alternative to other primary endpoints in determining the efficacy of the intervention. The multiple primary endpoints in the second case is called multiple co-primary endpoints to represent the simultaneous improvements required of the intervention." 17</p><p>Results from study C13007 demonstrated the efficacy of vedolizumab to induce remission at Weeks 6 and also showed that at week 52, a single point in time, a higher proportion of patients on vedolizumab compared to placebo were in remission (statistically significant). Study C13007 met the primary endpoint at Week 6 in the overall patient population. There were 2 primary endpoints for the induction study of equal rank (not co-primary endpoint but alternative endpoints), induction of remission and enhanced clinical response. For the second primary endpoint of enhanced clinical response (CDAI-100) at Week 6 in the overall population, the treatment difference favored vedolizumab but was not statistically significant.</p><p>The efficacy of vedolizumab to induce remission at Weeks 6 and 10 is supported by the results from Study C13011. All patients in these studies were treatment experienced, i.e., had failed conventional therapy (corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators) and/or TNFα antagonist treatment including primary nonresponders. Patients who had failed at least 1 and up to 3 TNFα antagonists made up approximately 50% of patients in Study C13007 and 75% of patients in Study C13011; notably 27% and 49% of the patients in each study, respectively, had failed 2 or more TNFα antagonists, representing a patient population with few, remaining treatment options, such as natalizumab with its associated risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). In addition, in contrast to other studies evaluating TNFα antagonist therapies for patients with CD, the 2 pivotal studies evaluating vedolizumab were different in that they included primary treatment failures to TNFα antagonists, a population in need of new therapies with a different mechanism of action.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Possible reasons for meeting one but not two alternative endpoints in the Induction Phase of study C13007</head><p>As previously reviewed, one of two alternative primary endpoints, "induction of clinical remission" (CDAI ≤ 150), was met in C13007, but not "enhanced clinical response" </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>71</head><p>(CDAI decrease of ≥ 100). The term "enhanced" was selected to call attention to the greater required decrease in CDAI; in previous registration trials, a decrease of the CDAI of ≥ 70 has been called "clinical response". The second alternative primary endpoint (enhanced clinical response) was apparently added as alternative endpoint to the initially chosen "clinical response" to provide a safety net in case the patients that were initially enrolled (who were sicker than anticipated) would not be able to have a large enough drop in CDAI to be counted as remitters (even if they responded well to vedolizumab), hence, the use of the drop-by-100 endpoint (enhanced clinical response).</p><p>We now know that the outcome was the reverse of what was expected: The "induction of clinical remission" endpoint was met but the "enhanced clinical response" was not. This seems counterintuitive and requires further attempts at analysis. In many immunemediated disease states, clinical trial endpoints are nested with the more stringent ones being subgroups of the less stringent one. Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) 100 and remission are independently calculated from the raw CDAI score. While they are often concordant, the concordance is not 100%.</p><p>The following information request was issued to the applicant:</p><p>"Perform an exploratory analysis of patient-level data to explain the divergent results between the two alternative primary endpoints in study 13007. Consider defining a "low-inflammatory subgroup" of patients (as evidenced by CRP and fecal calprotectin) and a "high-inflammatory" subgroup and analyze what proportion of patients in each subgroup contributed to the number of patients that achieved clinical remission or enhanced clinical response. Consider analyzing the relative contribution of the subscores of the CDAI to achieving the two alternative primary endpoints in the two subgroups, low-inflammatory and highinflammatory in a multivariate analysis. When defining the cut points for the lowand high-inflammatory subgroups, use the cut-points you have chosen for your subgroup analysis (p.138 Clinical Study Report C13007 <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>)."</p><p>The CDAI is overwhelmingly being driven by "abdominal pain, diarrhea frequency, and general well-being". In fact, the correlation between this 3-item short-CDAI to the 8-item full CDAI (as used in the vedolizumab studies), is excellent [Thia 2011]. However, these 3-items are also the paramount symptoms for diarrhea-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-D). IBS is known to coexist with IBD in approximately 40% of cases [Halpin 2012]. More importantly, very high CDAI scores can easily be attained by patients who have IBS [Lahiff 2013]. With this background, this reviewer formulated the following hypothesis:</p><p>1. Patients whose predominant reason for high CDAI scores is underlying IBS are enriched in the low-inflammatory subgroup. 2. Patients whose predominant reason for high CDAI scores is inflammatory activity are enriched in the high-inflammatory subgroup. 3. Patients with predominantly IBS symptoms may have high CDAI levels that can exhibit significant decreases in response to the institution of new treatment (CDAI decrease by 100), however, since anti-inflammatory agents do not address the underlying IBS pathomechanism, remission to a CDAI of less than 150 is less likely. 4. In consequence of the above, it is anticipated that the high inflammatory subgroup has relatively more remitters and the low-inflammatory subgroup relatively more "enhanced responders". However, since the low-inflammatory subgroup are enriched by placebo-responders, there should be little difference between active drug and placebo and a low "effect size".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory Analysis</head><p>As expected, the biomarker-defined high inflammatory group and low inflammatory group were equally distributed in patients with baseline CDAI scores ≤ 330 and &gt; 330.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between the Two Alternative Endpoints "Clinical remission" and "Enhanced Clinical Response" in Study C13007 (Induction)</head><p>Clinical Remission was defined as a decrease of the baseline Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) to values ≤ 150. "Enhanced Clinical Response" was defined as a decrease of the CDAI by ≥ 100 points (CDAI-100 Response). "Enhanced Clinical Response" (CDAI-100 Response) is not a perfect subset of Clinical Remission since CDAI-100 Response is not necessarily a prerequisite for Clinical Remission. For example, a patient whose baseline score was 220 and whose reassessment score was 150 would meet the definition of clinical remission but not the definition of CDAI-100 Response. It is not necessarily easier to achieve CDAI-100 Response as opposed to Clinical Remission. However, in this trial, all 7 patients who met criteria for Clinical Remission but not "Enhanced Clinical Response" (CDAI-100 Response) (see Venn diagram below) had baseline CDAI scores that did not meet the eligibility criteria for the trial, i.e., their baseline scores were &lt;220. Two of the seven were in the placebo arm (baseline scores 155 and 191). Five of the seven were in the vedolizumab arm (baseline scores 132, 142, 192, 213, and 218). In addition, two of these vedolizumab patients had baseline CDAI scores that met the protocol primary endpoint definition for remission (≤150).  The secondary endpoint of reduction in CRP at Week 6 in Study C13007 was not achieved in the overall population.     Trends favoring vedolizumab were observed for the primary endpoint and in all but 1 of the secondary endpoints (corticosteroid-free remission in Q8W group) in the Cohort 1 analyses.</p><p>In addition to corticosteroid-free remission, vedolizumab was also evaluated by whether patients who had discontinued corticosteroids for at least 90 and at least 180 days were in clinical remission at Week 52 (exploratory analyses). Of patients treated with corticosteroids at baseline, more patients treated with vedolizumab than placebo achieved corticosteroid-free clinical remission at Week 52 and had been corticosteroid free for 90 days, with treatment differences from placebo of 14.6% for Q8W (95% CI: 1.9, 27.3) and 9.1% for Q4W (95% CI: -3.1, 21.3). The corresponding treatment differences for vedolizumab patients who were corticosteroid-free for 180 days prior to</p><p>Week 52 were 15.9% (95% CI: 3.2, 28.5) for Q8W and 9.1% (95% CI: -2.8, 21.1) for Q4W.</p><p>To further determine the potential benefit of vedolizumab in patients using corticosteroids, the sponsor conducted post hoc analyses of corticosteroid use by study visit <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Figure 11</ref>). Because the data distribution curve for the doses of oral corticosteroids was highly skewed in Study C13007, post hoc analyses were performed on median change and median percent change from baseline in oral corticosteroid use.

Greater proportions of patients in the vedolizumab groups achieved the ordered secondary endpoint of durable clinical remission (clinical remission in ≥ 80% of study visits) compared to placebo, although the difference from placebo was not statistically significant (Q8W 7.2% difference; Q4W 2.0% difference) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref>).

The focus of the comparative safety review was on comparing adverse events across the induction and maintenance phase of the Phase 3 placebo-controlled trials which included a 52week induction and maintenance trial (C13006 in ulcerative colitis and C13007 in Crohn's disease). The patients from Clinical Trials C13006 and C13007 are believed to be sufficiently similar that pooling of the data is appropriate and will increase the power to find any safety signals. In addition, these patients were exposed to vedolizumab at the proposed dose for licensure (300 mg) and are similar to patients who may receive this product in clinical practice. The focus of these comparisons is on the 1434 patients who received vedolizumab only throughout the trial (VDZ/VDZ) and the 297 patients who received only placebo (PLA/PLA). An additional 279 patients received vedolizumab during induction and were randomized to receive placebo during the maintenance phase (VDZ/PLA).</p><p>Serious adverse events were reported in 19% of patients receiving vedolizumab throughout, compared to 13% of patients who received placebo only. Serious infection adverse events and those considered drug-related occurred with similar frequency between the vedolizumab and placebo groups (serious infection AE 4% and 3% respectively, and drug-related SAE 3% and 2%, respectively). The most frequently reported serious AEs (≥ 1% of the VDZ/VDZ population) were related to underlying IBD and included Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and anal abscess. The higher proportion of patients reporting at least 1 SAE in the vedolizumab group was largely driven by SAE reporting in C13007. There was a higher overall rate of serious adverse events in Trial C13007 for Crohn's disease, with 199 (24%) of patients in the combined vedolizumab group reporting at least 1 SAE, compared to 23 (16%) in the non-ITT placebo group.</p><p>Adverse events leading to clinical trial discontinuation was similar between the placebo groups and combined vedolizumab groups. The most common AEs resulting in study discontinuation from the combined vedolizumab group were ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.</p><p>One death (0.3%) occurred during the controlled clinical trial period in a patient receiving placebo, compared with 5 deaths 0.3%) in patients receiving vedolizumab. An additional 7 patients died in the open-label extension trial C13008, 3 with UC and 4 with CD. The events leading to death among the UC patients were respiratory failure, cerebrovascular accident, and pulmonary embolism. None of these events were determined to be related to study drug. Among the CD patients, traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, hepatic neoplasm, suicide, and sepsis led to patient deaths. Again, none of these deaths were determined to be related to the study drug, as per the clinical reviewer assessment.</p><p>The proportion of patients with at least 1 adverse event in studies C13006 and C13007 was 84%, 78% and 84% in the VDZ/VDZ, PLA/PLA, and VDZ/PLA group, respectively. The most commonly reported adverse events which occurred more commonly in the vedolizumab treated patients were nasopharyngitis, headache, arthralgia, nausea, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, and cough. All of these adverse events occurred in at least 5% of the combined vedolizumab group. The rates of common adverse events, when considered by patient-years, were similar between the combined vedolizumab group and the non-ITT placebo group. The frequency of nonserious AEs, categorized as "severe" was also similar between the 3 treatment groups in Studies C13006 and C13007. </p></div>

Given the potential risk for PML with this class of agents, however, the applicant was recommended to provide a significantly larger safety database. The final recommendation from the Division was that a minimum of 900 patients should have received ≥ 24 infusions with 4 weeks post-infusion follow up, in order to provide an acceptable pre-approval assessment of PML risk in patients with UC and CD.</p><p>A total of 3326 subjects had received at least 1 dose of vedolizumab in the clinical development program as of June 27, 2013. This included 1279 patients with UC, 1850 patients with CD, and 197 healthy subjects. Across all clinical studies, 2022 patients were exposed to vedolizumab for ≥ 6 months, 1418 patients for ≥ 12 months, 906 for ≥ 24 months, and 407 for ≥ 36 months. Patients were exposed to vedolizumab for a mean of 480.6 days in Phase 2 and 3 studies combined and for a mean of 532.0 days in phase 3 trials combined. <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">Table 26</ref> shows a summary of exposure to vedolizumab by months of exposure and number of infusions. Due to the increased risk of PML with natalizumab, an integrin receptor antagonist, other products with similar mechanisms of action may also be at increased risk for this rare but serious demyelinating disease caused by reactivation of latent JC virus infection in the central nervous system (CNS). The applicant completed nonclinical studies aimed at characterizing the binding specificity and selective antagonism of vedolizumab in order to support that vedolizumab has a lower risk of causing PML than natalizumab.</p><p>Vedolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to α4β7 integrin, a glycoprotein present on the surface of leukocytes involved in GI mucosal immunity. The ligand of α4β7 integrin is mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), which is preferentially expressed on the endothelium of GI mucosa. The mechanism of action of vedolizumab is the inhibition of leukocyte migration to the GI mucosa and interaction with MAdCAM-1. Natalizumab, in contrast, binds to the α4 integrin subunit and thus binds both α4β7 and α4β1, which binds to the endothelial ligand vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). An in vitro study utilizing cell lines selectively expressing specific integrins showed that vedolizumab selectively binds to α4β7 and does not bind to α4β1 or αEβ7 integrin. This study also examined the selectivity of vedolizumab for inhibition of α4β7-mediated cell adhesion interactions and showed that vedolizumab inhibited α4β7-MAdCAM-1 and fibronectin and did not inhibit α4β7-VCAM-1, α4β1-VCAM-1, or α4β1-fibronectin-mediated adhesive interactions.</p><p>A decrease in immune surveillance of the CNS by T-lymphocytes is hypothesized to contribute to the development of PML. The sponsor conducted a study using an Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in Rhesus monkeys (a model of multiple sclerosis; there is no animal model of PML) to assess the impact of vedolizumab and natalizumab on CNS immune surveillance. The results of this study showed that while natalizumab appeared to inhibit immune surveillance of the CNS, vedolizumab had no such effect. In addition, a 3-week comparative immunotoxicity study of natalizumab and vedolizumab was completed in Cynomolgus monkeys. Natalizumab caused a significant increase in lymphocyte populations (e.g., blymphocytes, t-helper lymphocytes, etc.), whereas there was no change in these populations in vedolizumab-treated monkeys.</p><p>The applicant proposes that their nonclinical data supports the specificity of vedolizumab and the use of vedolizumab does not carry the same increased risk of PML as natalizumab. The clinical testing performed as part of routine safety assessments was adequate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.5">Metabolic, Clearance, and Interaction Workup</head><p>Vedolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, and the primary routes of elimination are likely proteolytic degradation and receptor mediated clearance, thus classical in vitro studies (e.g., human liver microsomes/P450 studies) to investigate PK and vedolizumab's interaction potential were not conducted.</p><p>No clinical studies were conducted to specifically evaluate the effect of co-administered drugs on the PK of vedolizumab. The potential for vedolizumab to act as a perpetrator of drug-drug interactions is low, as vedolizumab is an antibody and does not modulate cytokines. The potential for vedolizumab to be impacted by other drugs commonly used in the UC and CD population (e.g., methotrexate, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and aminosalicylates) was assessed through population PK modeling from phase 3 studies.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.6">Evaluation for Potential Adverse Events for Similar Drugs in Drug Class</head><p>Natalizumab, the only currently approved integrin antagonist, is associated with an increased risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patients with multiple sclerosis and Crohn's Disease. As a result, integrin antagonists in development have been required to include thorough PML risk identification and minimization programs in their clinical trials and ensure that premarketing patient drug exposure is sufficient to assess the risk for PML before drug approval. The applicant's approach to evaluating for this potential serious risk is described below.</p><p>3326 subjects had received at least 1 dose of vedolizumab in the clinical development program as of the cut-off date for inclusion of safety data in the BLA (14March2013), and there were zero cases of PML. This included 1279 patients with UC, 1850 patients with CD, and 197 healthy subjects. One thousand and four (1004) patients received ≥ 24 vedolizumab infusions with 4 weeks follow-up. As described in Section 7.2.1, the applicant's pre-approval safety database size was based on Division recommendations that in order to provide a pre-approval assessment of PML risk in patients with UC and CD that would be adequate to take to Advisory Committee for consideration, a minimum of 900 patients should have received ≥ 24 vedolizumab infusions with 4 weeks postinfusion follow up.</p><p>The applicant proposes that based on the safety database provided at the time of submission, they have demonstrated that the risk for PML in UC and CD patients taking vedolizumab is less than the risk for PML in patients taking natalizumab. Although direct comparison of vedolizumab to natalizumab is infeasible, the total number of patients and exposure time of vedolizumab is compared to that of natalizumab when the first three PML cases on it were identified. In clinical trials of natalizumab, two PML cases were identified in 1,869 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and one PML case in 1,043 Crohn's disease (CD) patients. The overall mean duration of exposure to natalizumab was approximately 18 months. This was based on 3 confirmed cases of PML in 3116 patients exposed for this period of time.</p><p>drug by the study site investigator. <ref type="table" target="#tab_17">Table 38 below summarizes the deaths in the UC  population which occurred during participation in clinical studies, and Table 39</ref> summarizes the deaths in the CD population.</p><p>112 cardiopulmonary arrest 660 days after her last dose of study drug.

None of the deaths in UC patients were assessed to be related to study drug, as determined by study investigators and confirmed by the FDA reviewer. In C13007, 2 deaths were assessed as possibly related to study drug by the investigator. Both of these deaths were the result of exacerbation of CD and sepsis/infection. The FDA reviewer believes these CD exacerbations were not likely related to study drug, rather exacerbations due to lack of drug effect in these patients, and therefore would not categorize them as related to study drug. One additional death in a CD patient participating in C13008 was assessed as possibly related to study drug. This was a case of hepatocellular carcinoma occurring approximately 3 years after initiation of vedolizumab. The FDA reviewer believes it is not plausible this death was related to study drug, given the mechanism of action for vedolizumab. Given the low incidence rate, it is difficult to comment further on any potential relationship. Adverse events, including SAEs and deaths, should continue to be collected and assessed in the postmarketing setting.</p></div>

The proportion of patients with at least one SAE was higher in the combined vedolizumab group than the non-ITT placebo group (24% vs. 16%). SAEs determined by the investigator to be drug related occurred infrequently and there were no differences seen between treatment arms in the ITT groups (placebo 3%, VDZ Q8W 3%, VDZ Q4W 4%); SAE's determined by the investigator to be drug related were higher in the combined vedolizumab group (4%) than the non-ITT placebo group (1%). SAEs which were reported by greater than 1% of patients by PT are summarized in the tables below.  The proportion of patients with SAEs in the patients with baseline immunomodulator and/or corticosteroid use was also analyzed in C13007. Patients receiving vedolizumab with baseline concomitant corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators did not have increased rates of SAEs, in comparison to patients not on these medications. SAEs which were reported by greater than 1 person are summarized below, based on concomitant immunosuppressant and/or corticosteroid use. No trends were identified.

This visit was identical to the Week 52 assessment and included a physical examination, PML checklist, and appropriate labwork. These patients were also to have completed the Week 66/Final Safety visit and complete a 2year follow-up survey. Patients with adverse events determined by the investigator as related to study drug were not eligible for Trial C13008, however those with AEs determined to be unrelated were eligible for enrollment in the long-term safety study.</p><p>Overall, a high percentage of patients discontinued from Trial C13007, with the highest proportion discontinuing from the non-ITT placebo arm (72%) followed by combined vedolizumab arm (61%) and ITT-placebo arm (58%), respectively. The majority of patients discontinued due to lack of efficacy (42% ITT-placebo, 54% non-ITT placebo, and 39% combined vedolizumab, respectively), and these discontinuations happened primarily during the Maintenance Phase of the Clinical Trial. See Section 6.1.3 Patient Disposition for additional details.</p><p>Similar proportions of patients discontinued from Study C13007 for an adverse event from the placebo groups than from the vedolizumab groups. Fifteen (10%) patients in the ITT placebo arm discontinued for an AE, compared to 12 (8%) patients in the ITT VDZ Q8W group and 9 (6%) patients in the ITT VDZ Q4W group. Similarly, 14 patients (9%) discontinued from the non-ITT placebo group for an AE, compared to 92 patients (11%) from the combined VDZ group. The most commonly reported AE leading to discontinuation in any treatment arm was Crohn's disease which was reported at rates of 5% in the ITT placebo group, 7% in the non-ITT placebo group, and 5% in the combined vedolizumab group. The only other AE leading to study discontinuation that occurred in more than 1% of patients in each treatment group was abdominal pain (1% in ITT placebo group; 0% in non-ITT placebo group, and &lt;1% in the combined vedolizumab group). Adverse events leading to discontinuations in at least 1% of patients are summarized in. This table includes all patients who discontinued at any time from Week 0.</p><p>neurological adverse events, specifically related to the potential risk for PML, were primary safety concerns in this submission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Infection-related Events</head><p>MAdCAM-1 binding sites are predominantly in the gastrointestinal tract but are also distributed in the nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal and vaginal tissue. Based on this distribution, an increased rate of upper respiratory tract, esophageal, and vaginal infections may be expectedthis is believed to be related to the known mechanism of action and targets of vedolizumab and not related to immunosuppression. Similarly, given vedolizumab's mechanism of action and inhibition of lymphocyte trafficking to the GI tract there is a risk of increased GI infections, as well as systemic infections from enteric pathogens such as Listeria, Salmonella, and C. difficile and Campylobacter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CD Comparative Safety:</head><p>In C13007, a higher proportion of patients reported at least 1 infection in the ITT combined vedolizumab group than in the non-ITT placebo group and similar to the ITT placebo group (42% ITT placebo; 39% non-ITT placebo; 44% combined vedolizumab).</p><p>In the infections and infestations SOC, the most commonly reported HLT was upper respiratory tract infections (19% ITT placebo; 18% non-ITT placebo; 23% combined vedolizumab); this appears to have driven the difference in frequency of infections between groups. Other infection HLTs reported in ≥ 5% of patients in the combined vedolizumab arm were abdominal and gastrointestinal infections (8%), lower respiratory tract and lung infections (6%), and urinary tract infections (5%). A similar proportion of patients reported these events in each of the treatment arms. The proportion of patients with infection was slightly higher in the ITT vedolizumab Q8W and the ITT vedolizumab Q4W arms than the ITT placebo arm (46% ITT vedolizumab Q8W; 45% ITT vedolizumab Q4W; 42% ITT placebo); however, no significant differences were noted when comparing specific HLTs.</p><p>Infections of specific interest with vedolizumab use include Clostridium difficile, candida, and herpes infections. These cases occurred at similar frequencies in vedolizumab treated patients and placebo patients; all were considered mild to moderate in intensity, most resolved by the end of the study, and only 2 herpes-related infections resulted in study discontinuation (1 case of herpes zoster and 1 case of oral herpes) and 1 Clostridium difficile infection resulted in study discontinuation. Serious infections occurred infrequently in all treatment groups with 54 patients (5%) reporting serious adverse events in the infections and infestations SOC (3% ITT placebo; 3% non-ITT placebo; 6% combined vedolizumab). The frequency of SAEs in the Infections and Infestations SOC was higher in the VDZ groups than the Placebo groups. Of the SAEs reported, only anal abscess, abdominal abscess, gastroenteritis, appendicitis, and device related infection were reported by more than one patient. These results are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_41">Table 48</ref> below.</p><p>There were three serious sepsis-related events reported in patients receiving vedolizumab (in Study C13007):  Bacterial sepsis: Patient C13007-27003-705 (a 24 year old male) was hospitalized for Gram (-) sepsis twelve days after his fourth dose of vedolizumab and was treated with antibiotics. The event resolved 10 days after onset, and was believed to be related to the study drug.  Sepsis: Patient C13007-24001-705 (a 28 year old male) received five doses of vedolizumab and withdrew from the study approximately 6 weeks later initially for hospitalization for CD exacerbation and scleritis. Approximately 10 days later, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and had a central line inserted, and died 17 days later with reported cause of death of multiorgan dysfunction with consumptive coagulopathy, fungal sepsis, and CD with immunocompromised status. On CT scan, the patient was found to have a pneumoperitoneum. The event was believed to be related to the study drug.  Septic shock: Patient C13007-24028-708 (a 30 year old male) was hospitalized for septic shock 28 days after his fourth dose of vedolizumab and died one day later. The event was believed to be related to the study drug. Note that 1 serious event (device related sepsis) occurred in Patient C13007-27002-702 (a 34 year old male) in the non-ITT placebo group and resolved.</p></div>

The phlegm was not gram stained or cultured. The event resulted in discontinuation from the study 5 days later and was considered resolved another 4 days later. The event was believed to be related to the study drug. received 3 doses of vedolizumab over a 2-month period. One day after his last dose, the patient presented with a mild cough. A quantiferon test was positive; chest x-ray was negative (a quantiferon test had been negative prior to study enrollment). The event was reported as latent TB Quantiferon positive. The patient was afebrile, in good condition with normal physical findings and was administered isoniazid and pyridoxine. He was permanently discontinued from the study in response to the event. The event was reported as serious and the patient discontinued from the study. The event is considered unresolved. The event was considered related to the study drug. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Infusion related Events and Hypersensitivity reactions</head><p>Infusion-related events were analyzed as AEs assessed by the investigatory to be infusionrelated and AEs that occurred within 1 calendar day of an infusion. Patients were to be monitored for infusion-related reactions during and after infusions and report the development of symptoms consistent with infusion-reactions (e.g. hives, pruritus) to the investigator. The ISS analyzed investigator-defined infusion related events. Adverse events defined by the investigator as infusion-related reactions were in the SOCs of general disorders and administration site conditions, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, immune system disorders, and respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CD Comparative Safety</head><p>Investigator-defined infusion-related events were uncommon and were seen at similar rates in patients that received a dose of vedolizumab as patients receiving placebo in Study C13007 [39 (4%) of the 967 patients in the combined vedolizumab and ITT placebo groups vs. 8 (5%) of the 148 patients in the 5% non-ITT placebo group). One patient, described below, experienced an infusion-related reaction that was considered serious and resulted in discontinuation from the study, and an additional 5 vedolizumab-treated patients experienced reactions resulting in study dose interruption (a dose was considered interrupted if it was started, stopped, then re-started again and a complete dose was administered for the visit).</p><p> Patient C13007-13006-703 (a 44 year old female from Denmark) experienced dyspnea, bronchospasm, urticaria, flushing, rash, and increased blood pressure and heart rate 13 minutes after the start of her second vedolizumab infusion. The infusion was discontinued and the patient was treated with oxygen, an antihistamine, and IV hydrocortisone. The event was noted as resolved approximately 3 hours later. The patient was discontinued from the study due to the event. The SAE of infusion-related reaction was considered to be related to study drug</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>UC and CD Comparative Safety</head><p>Across the UC and CD phase 3 induction/maintenance studies, 3% of patients who received only placebo had an AE defined by the investigator as infusion-related, compared to 4% of patients who received at least 1 dose of vedolizumab (3% ITT placebo and 4% combined vedolizumab). Four patients, described below, discontinued from C13006 and C13007 due to an infusion-related reaction, and an additional 11 vedolizumab-treated patients experienced reactions that resulted in interruption of an infusion.</p><p>In addition to the 1 patient described above, 3 patients from C13006 described below experienced an infusion-related reaction resulting in discontinuation from the study.</p><p> A 47-year-old female enrolled in C13006 reported right eye pruritis and swelling approximately 1 hour after completion of her first and only vedolizumab infusion. She was treated with loratadine and the event had resolved by 9 hours after completion of the infusion. The patient discontinued from the study due to this reaction.</p><p> A 28-year old male enrolled in C13006 developed a pruritic, urticarial rash involving the arms, face, and flank approximately 10 minutes after his 6 th dose of vedolizumab was of colon cancer appear to be consistent with what is expected in this patient population, based on the HIRD database.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CD Comparative Safety</head><p>In Study C13007, 30% of patients in the ITT-placebo arm reported at least 1 nervous system event, compared to 20% and 22% in the non-ITT placebo and combination vedolizumab arms, respectively. In Study C13007, paresthesias and dysesthesias were observed in 2.79 % of 718 vedolizumab treated patients in study C13007 and there were no reports in 148 placebo treated patients. However, in C13006, paresthesias and dysesthesias were approximately equally distributed between the vedolizumab and placebo arms (1.2 % and 1.3 %, respectively) (see UC Comparative Safety subsection below).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>UC Comparative Safety</head><p>The results were similar in the Phase 3 UC Study (C13006). A similar proportion of patients reported at least 1 nervous system event in each treatment arm with 28 (19%) of placebo patients and 129 (21%) of combined vedolizumab treated patients reporting at least one neurological AE. The rates were similar in the patients who received vedolizumab during induction and placebo during the maintenance phase (18% placebo-ITT). The most frequently reported HLT was Headaches NEC which was reported at similar rates in the combined vedolizumab and ITT-placebo group and less frequently in the non-ITT placebo group (13% ITT placebo; 10% non-ITT placebo, 14% combined vedolizumab). The next most common HLT reported was Neurological signs and symptoms NEC, which was reported at similar rates across groups (2% ITT placebo; 1% non-ITT placebo, 4% combined vedolizumab). No patient discontinued from Study C13006 due to a nervous system event, and only one event was designated as serious by the investigator (syncope by patient in ITT VDZ Q4W group).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Long-term UC and CD Safety</head><p>In the long-term safety study, C13008, 30% of patients reported at least 1 nervous system AE as of June 27, 2013, with headaches reported most commonly in UC and CD patients. Nervous system AEs were reported with similar frequencies for UC and CD patients. Nervous system AEs reported by greater than 1% of patients are summarized by indication in <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 53</ref>, below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>130</head><p>The effect of vedolizumab on cardiac repolarization was evaluated in Study C13009. A total of 87 subjects were enrolled in the study. In Part 1 (unblinded), 13 subjects were assigned to a single IV dose of 300-mg Process C vedolizumab. In Part 2 (blinded, randomized), 23 subjects were randomized to a single IV dose of 600-mg Process B vedolizumab, 26 subjects were randomized to a single IV dose of 600-mg Process C vedolizumab, and 25 subjects were randomized to a single IV dose of placebo.</p><p>Overall, there were no marked mean changes in ECG parameters. Two (8%) subjects in the placebo treatment group and 10 (20%) subjects in the vedolizumab treatment group had maximum post baseline QTcF values between 430 to 449 msec, and 7 (14%) subjects in the vedolizumab treatment group had maximum post baseline QTcB values between 430 to 449 msec. Four (17%) subjects in the placebo treatment group and 4 (9%) subjects in the vedolizumab treatment group had a ≥ 30 msec change in QTcB, and 2 (4%) subjects in the vedolizumab treatment group had a ≥ 30 msec change in QTcF. No subjects had QTc &gt; 450 msec or had ≥ 60 msec change in QTc from baseline.</p><p>One (5%) subject in the placebo treatment group had an abnormal ECG on Day 85 that was considered clinically significant. The abnormality was reported as a single, mild, drug-related cardiac AE of atrial fibrillation; no action was taken and the event resolved. No subjects in the vedolizumab treatment groups had abnormal ECG parameters during the study that were considered clinically significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study C13012:</head><p>Study C13012 was a phase 1 single-arm study in healthy adults to assess the effects of a single 450mg intravenous dose of vedolizumab on the CD4+:CD8+ lymphocyte ratio in the CSF of humans. One hypothesis on the etiology for the increased risk of PML with natalizumab is that it prevents the ingress of leukocytes into the CNS. Vedolizumab did not affect CD4+ counts, CD8+ counts, or the CD4+:CD8+ lymphocyte ratio in the CSF of the subjects studied. The applicant suggests that this supports that vedolizumab is unlikely to lead to impairment of the CNS immune system and potentially increased PML risk.</p><p>No special safety studies were performed in the vedolizumab clinical development program. The RAMP algorithm was developed to mitigate the risk of PML and identify early any potential PML cases. This is described in detail in sections 7.2.6 and 7.3.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4.6">Immunogenicity</head><p>The immunogenicity of vedolizumab was assessed across multiple studies and the effects of human antihuman antibodies (HAHA) on safety were evaluated. A validated ELISA immunoassay with a sensitivity of 440 pg/mL was used to determine the presence of HAHA. Immunogenicity assessment consisted of an initial screening using dilutions of 1:5 and 1:50; positive samples were subsequently confirmed positive, tittered, and tested for neutralization.</p><p>Patients were considered to be transiently positive if they had at least one positive HAHA sample and no consecutive HAHA positive samples, while patients categorized as persistently positive had 2 or more consecutive positive samples. To better characterize the overall reported AEs among treatment group, nor was a signal of increased risk for an adverse event observed when assessing AEs by baseline concomitant drug use. See section 7.3.2 for additional information on serious adverse events in this subgroup of patients.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: This reviewer saw no apparent signals for increased risk for an adverse event or any type of adverse event when assessing AEs by a variety of demographic factors, including age, sex, geographic region, and prior treatments. While there appeared to be an increased proportion of AEs in patients with previous TNFα use, the rates of AEs were similar between treatment groups in this subset, suggesting patients with previous TNFα use may have more serious underlying disease and higher baseline risk for adverse events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.5.4">Drug-Disease Interactions</head><p>The safety evaluation included an evaluation controlling for baseline disease severity. There were insufficient patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min to allow meaningful comparison.</p><p>There is the potential that disease improvement can impact CYP450 and thus lead to disease-drug-drug interactions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.5.5">Drug-Drug Interactions</head><p>Monoclonal antibody-drug interactions are not common and when they occur are likely from overlaps in the mechanism of action, alteration in target, or drug-disease interaction. In addition, monoclonal antibodies that modulate cytokine production may affect the regulation pathways of P450 enzymes. Vedolizumab was not found to modulate cytokine production in in vitro and clinical studies.</p><p>No adverse events were observed that were assessed as related to drug-drug interactions. Reviewer comment: The applicants waiver and deferral request appear appropriate to this reviewer. We generally have waived requirements for pediatric studies of CD treatments in children under the age of 6 years due to the low CD incidence in that age group; however, inclusion of patients as young as of age in the applicant's pediatric plan is acceptable. The final determination of waiver and deferral will be made upon presentation to the Pediatric Research Committee (PeRC) in January.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evidence for off-target effects of vedolizumab</head><p>The applicant states that vedolizumab is a "gut-specific 34 " integrin antagonist that has a different mechanism of action (MOA) than natalizumab, and is, therefore, safer than natalizumab. Briefly, the applicant argues that vedolizumab blocks only lymphocyte receptor α4β7 and that MadCAM1 and fibronectin are the only counter-receptors for α4β7 (relevant references are in <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 59</ref>). Because MadCAM1, according to the applicant, is a gut-specific cell adhesion molecule, vedolizumab only acts on the gut, and is therefore also gut-specific. In contrast, natalizumab, an α4β1 antagonist, induces mobilization of bone marrow cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bonig et al. 2008</ref>) and leads to leukocytosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Miller et al. 2003</ref>). Furthermore, natalizumab affects the adaptive immune response to extragastrointestinal challenges and inhibits leukocyte infiltration into the CNS (see references for <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 59</ref>). A decreased immune surveillance of the CNS together with mobilization of JC-infected 35 bone marrow cells have been postulated to be etiologic or contributing factors for the emergence of PML (progressive multifocal encephalopathy). The applicant states that none of these effects have been described with vedolizumab 36 . See <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 59</ref>. Reference ID: 3428850 An exploratory analysis of data from the Crohn's disease trial C13007 and the Ulcerative Colitis trial C13006 casts considerable doubt on the "gut-specificity" of vedolizumab. The exposition is followed by some possible mechanistic explanations and suggestions for labeling and postmarketing studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Probably no bone marrow effects</head><p>The applicant states that vedolizumab sequesters approximately 1% of leukocytes and natalizumab 40 % 37 . The sequestration of lymphocytes that have lost their home in the lymphoid tissues of the gut are part of the mechanism of action of vedolizumab and lymphocytosis that contributes minimally to the total white cell count (leukocytes) is expected and were indeed observed in study C13007 (data not shown). If the effect is limited to the gut homing lymphocytes, no increased numbers of cells of myeloid lineage (for example, neutrophils) are expected, neither mature granulocytes nor immature precursor cells such as myelocytes.</p><p>The following graph shows total neutrophil counts (as measured by automated cell counters) for the induction and maintenance phase of study C13007 in JReview.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 19 Total neutrophil counts (average at each time point) for the induction and maintenance phase of study C13007 -JReview output</head><p>The graph shows that at every study visit the average number of neutrophils in the vedolizumab (q 4 weeks) arm is numerically higher than in the placebo arm with a possible normalization after completion of the study following visit 52 (52 weeks). Numerically, the following is seen (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">Table 60</ref>): 38 <ref type="bibr">38</ref> It is not clear why there is a difference of neutrophils upon entry, prior to the use of vedolizumab. However, it is not likely that the neutrophil count of a randomly selected group of patients with the same disease should, even if there was a difference at the start of the study, remain elevated throughout the entire study period. The presence of increased myelocytes in the vedolizumab group further supports the conclusion that vedolizumab may have an effect on the bone marrow. The fluctuating course of the neutrophil increases is consistent with repeated dosing at intervals but other explanations are possible including a baseline difference that persisted.</p><p>In addition to automated white cell counts, limited data on manual differentials are available which suggest that, in addition to fluctuating increases of automatically counted neutrophils demonstrated above (average 6.4 %) (see table above), the number of myelocytes are increased in the vedolizumab q 4 weeks arm Figure 21:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 21 Myelocytes relative to total leukocytes in C13007</head><p>The above graph shows the average number of myelocytes relative to the number of leukocytes. While the data points are few, a relative increase of peripheral myelocytes appears to be present in the vedolizumab arm which is consistent with mobilization of immature bone marrow cells.</p><p>A similar analysis as above (on total neutrophils and manual differentials) was performed for the every 8 week dosing of vedolizumab in study C13007. Interestingly, the hematological abnormalities affecting neutrophils are not seen with the lower dose. Also, a similar analysis was conducted on study C13006, and the potential signal could not be replicated.</p><p>In summary, the hematological data in C13007 would seem to suggest that vedolizumab may have off-target effects on the bone marrow based on the observed increased neutrophil and myelocyte counts in the peripheral blood when given every 4 weeks but not when given every 8 weeks. This effect was not observed in the Ulcerative Colitis study C13006. The results in C13007 q 4 weeks are, therefore, considered more likely spurious than not. Although the applicant has already demonstrated that CD34+ cells (a marker of immaturity) do not increase in response to the administration of vedolizumab in a small study in healthy volunteers, a determination of circulating CD34+ cells in response to the administration of vedolizumab in patients with IBD (rather than healthy volunteers) could further reassure us that this is indeed the case (see Section 1.4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanism</head><p>There are multiple possible mechanisms how vedolizumab could cause mobilization of myeloid derived cells from the bone marrow. Here we will limit ourselves to the suggestion of a possible role of α4β7 antagonism in the bone marrow. Although α 4 β 1 (VLA-4) has been assumed to represent the chief (or sole) functional α 4 integrin on stem/progenitor cells in the bone marrow, at least two papers report on a potential role for α 4 β 7 for hematogenic precursor cell homing to the bone marrow after transplantation in experimental animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Katayama et al. 2004</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Tada et al. 2008</ref>). Homing of cells implies attachment to cell adhesion molecules and decreased attachment to the bone marrow stroma by blockade of this attachment mechanism could explain appearance of bone marrow derived cells in the peripheral blood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evidence for interference with mucosal defense/immune function outside the gut</head><p>Mucosal surfaces inside and outside the gastrointestinal tract maintain a constant vigilance against pathogens, mediated partly by continuous antigen sampling by antigen presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, and B-cells (Lawson, Norton, and Clements 2011). The integrins and their counter receptors play an important role in the trafficking of immunoglobulin A and G secreting cells to the mucosa in addition to their effects on T-cells. The traditional understanding is that the differential expression of the alpha4beta7 integrin ligand mucosal addressin celladhesion molecule 1 (MADCAM1) in the gut, and the alpha4beta1 (and alpha4beta7) integrin ligand vascular cell-adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) in other mucosal tissues fundamentally subdivides intestinal and non-intestinal tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kunkel and Butcher 2003)</ref>.</p><p>The applicant argues that vedolizumab is gut specific because the counter receptor for alpha4beta7 (MADCAM 1) is limited to the gut. In other words, effects on the extraintestinal mucosal immune defense should not occur or are negligible. This is in contrast with natalizumab where pleotropic broad bases effects are observed. This reviewer will quote published papers which suggest a role of MAdCAM 1 and alpha4beta7 integrins outside the gastrointestinal tract, and present adverse event data from the clinical studies that suggest that vedolizumab affects the mucosal immune defense outside the gastrointestinal tract and the skin, which, while not mucosa, also has a barrier function. 39</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Respiratory Tract Infections</head><p>In the natalizumab Crohn's disease trial, the incidence of nasopharyngitis was 11% in the natalizumab group and 6 % in the placebo group which was nominally significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Targan et al. 2007</ref>). Interestingly, the results for natalizumab were similar, with 13 % and 7%, respectively (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 61</ref>) A review of the common adverse events suggests that patients that have received vedolizumab had approximately double the incidence of nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, and influenza. Oropharyngeal pain and cough are symptoms that may represent undiagnosed infections and these symptoms were also more frequently seen in patients receiving vedolizumab. These data suggest that vedolizumab may lower the resistance to viral and bacterial infections of the upper aerodigestive tract. Pruritus was also more common with vedolizumab than with placebo and this may be related to a possible effect of vedolizumab on the skin, which will further addressed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanism and Information Request</head><p>Based on the above findings the clinical reviewers in conjunction with a CBER immunologist, Dr. Jennifer Reed, issued an information request to the applicant inquiring whether the following studies had been conducted: The applicant responded that no such studies (items 1. and 2.) had been performed.</p><p>Furthermore we asked: 3. In your preclinical study 502045, you found increased balantidium sp protozoa in some animals receiving α4β7 blockade. In what other studies has α4β7 blockade been linked with a change in gut flora?</p><p>The applicant contributed several non-clinical studies that answered this question. In summary, the applicant responded that existing data demonstrate that inhibition of α4β7 function can increase, decrease, or have no effect on gut flora. While MAdCAM 1 is traditionally thought to be expressed in low levels, if at all, outside the gastrointestinal tract, it appears that MAdCAM 1 plays an important role in the immune function of Nasal-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (NALT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Csencsits, Jutila, and Pascual 1999</ref>). An impairment of NALT immune function by vedolizumab would explain the increased incidence of nasopharyngitis. This is an exploratory analysis and the CI and p-values are given for information only. A continuity correction of 0.5 was applied.</p></div>

Folliculitis (a preferred MEDDRA term) was seen in 1.1 % of patients treated with vedolizumab in C13007and was not reported in the placebo group. Folliculitis and related conditions could be caused by a decreased immune surveillance mediated by T-cell dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Robert and Kupper 1999)</ref>.

Blockade of alpha4beta7 by vedolizumab may interfere with the control of skin inflammation in currently unknown ways.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary and Regulatory Relevance</head><p>Review of hematological laboratory data and adverse events seems to show that vedolizumab has off-target effects affecting the upper respiratory tract, the skin and, perhaps, the peripheral nervous system and bone marrow. Some of these adverse events appear to be, at this time, of minor importance, however, they show that the use of the terms for vedolizumab is not warranted, and the applicant should not use this descriptor for promotional materials and journal publications.</p><p>Determination of IgA and IgM in nasopharyngeal samples or lung lavage, B and T lymphocyte recovery in lung lavage, and cytokine evaluation in lavage or tissue homogenate could be included in an observational post marketing study in order to elucidate the mechanism for the increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infections, specifically, nasopharyngitis. This Reviewer recommends that (pending discussion with reviewers in the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology -Divisions of Pharmacovigilance, Epidemiology, and Risk Management) determination of IgA and IgM in nasopharyngeal samples should be included as a substudy in the proposed observational postmarketing study (see Section 1.4).</p><p>The incidence of "paraesthesias and dysaesthesias" in C13007 was 2.8 % in the vedolizumab arm and 0 % in the placebo arm with an odds ratio of 8.7 and relative risk of 8.5 (and a corresponding nominal p-value of 0.035). This could be a signal of considerable importance even if it was not seen in study C13006 because neurotoxicity is not implausible: Many biologic agents, so far mostly anti-TNF agents, have been associated with paradoxical induction of autoimmune processes, and these autoimmune processes may present as peripheral neuropathy caused by demyelination or vasculitis (Ramos-Casals et al. 2010).</p><p>This reviewer recommends that "paraesthesias and dysaesthesias" and "skin conditions" should be considered (pending discussion with reviewers in the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology -Divisions of Pharmacovigilance, Epidemiology, and Risk Management) to be included as adverse events of special interest with targeted neurological and dermatological investigations in the proposed post-marketing observational study or in an enhanced pharmacovigilance plan to further evaluate and characterize the potential risk of neuropathy and dermopathy with vedolizumab. (See Section 1.4) This reviewer recommends that the label call attention to an increased incidence of "epidermal and skin conditions" based on the strength of the evidence, and to "paraesthesias and dysaesthesias" observed in C13007 based on the potential seriousness of the condition.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Recommendation on Regulatory Action</head><p>It is the recommendation of this reviewer that vedolizumab be approved for the indication of:</p><p>inducing and maintaining clinical response and remission, improving endoscopic appearance of the mucosa, and achieving corticosteroid-free remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either immunomodulators or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Risk Benefit Assessment</head><p>Moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) is a serious chronic disease which has a substantial impact on patients' quality of life. Patients with UC experience recurrent episodes of bloody mucoid diarrhea and abdominal pain which may be followed by quiescent periods. Patients may also exhibit systemic symptoms including fever, malaise, and weight loss; and severe colitis can result in ischemic colitis requiring surgical colectomy. While colectomy is considered curative in UC, it is associated with significant morbidity, including recurrent pouchitis in up to 25% of patients, fecal incontinence, and female infertility. Finally, patients with long-standing UC are at increased risk for colorectal cancer which is thought to be related to chronic inflammation.</p><p>Available treatments for moderate to severe disease include corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and monoclonal antibodies targeting TNF-α (i.e., infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab). Limitations exist, however, and many patients are unable to achieve sustained remission despite optimizing currently available therapies. Other patients develop intolerance to or side effects from their current treatment regimens. Additional treatment options for patients with moderately to severely active UC, particularly those who have failed prior anti-TNF therapy, is needed.</p><p>Review of the current Application reveals that the benefit of vedolizumab for reducing signs and symptoms and inducing and maintaining induction of clinical remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have failed prior therapies has been adequately demonstrated, and the benefit outweighs the risks associated with the use of the drug product. The data provided by the applicant to support this indication was from a single Trial, C13006, a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 895 patients with moderately to severely active UC. This trial was conducted under a single protocol but designed and analyzed as 2 separate studies: C13006 Induction Study and C13006 Maintenance Study. The results were highly reliable, statistically strong, and internally consistent, supporting the efficacy of vedolizumab from a single study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Induction Study Results Summary</head><p>According to my review of the clinical data, the applicant demonstrated that vedolizumab is effective in meeting its primary induction endpoint, clinical response at Week 6, where response is defined as a reduction in the complete Mayo score of ≥3 points and ≥30% from baseline with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of ≥1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤1 point. The proportion of patients in clinical response at Week 6 was significantly greater in the vedolizumab group (47.1%) relative to placebo (25.5%). The difference from placebo was 21.7% (95% CI: 11.6, 31.7; p&lt; 0.0001). Vedolizumab appeared to be slightly less effective in the subgroup of patients who previously failed TNFα agents, however, even in these more difficult to treat patients, vedolizumab performed better than placebo. The applicant's results were internally consistent across a variety of subgroups, including age, gender, race, disease duration, geographic region, and baseline disease activity. While the study was not powered for key subgroup analyses and there was no multiplicity adjustment, because they were consistent with the overall results this reviewer feels they can generally be believed.</p><p>The applicant demonstrated evidence of effectiveness for the secondary Induction endpoint, the proportion of patients with clinical remission at Week 6. Thirty-eight patients (16.9%) in the vedolizumab group achieved clinical remission, compared to 8 patients (5.4%) in the placebo group. The difference from placebo was 11.5% (p = 0.0009).</p><p>The prespecified secondary endpoint for mucosal healing was defined as Mayo endoscopic subscore of ≤ 1 point. Using the prespecified definition, 40.9% of patients in the vedolizumab treatment group achieved mucosal healing, compared with 24.8% of patients receiving placebo, a 16.1% treatment difference (p = 0.0012). The applicant provided no histologic data to support a labeling claim for "mucosal healing", however; the data provided would support a labeling claim of "improved endoscopic appearance of the mucosa".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Maintenance Study Results</head><p>The applicant demonstrated substantial evidence of effectiveness for the primary endpoint for the Maintenance Study, the proportion of patients with clinical remission at Week 52, where clinical remission was defined as total Mayo score of ≤ 2 points with no Clinical Review Laurie Muldowney BLA 125476 Entyvio (vedolizumab) 12 individual subscore &gt; 1 point. Both vedolizumab dosing regimens were independently significantly better than placebo, using the applicant's definition for remission. In the Q8W dosing group, the difference from placebo was 26.1%, and in the Q4W group, the difference was 29.1%, with p &lt; 0.0001 for both groups. Again, sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses performed by the applicant (e.g., age, gender, race, duration of disease, geographic region, and baseline disease activity, anti-TNF users and failures) were generally consistent and supported the efficacy of vedolizumab in maintaining clinical remission.</p><p>In addition, the applicant adequately demonstrated that vedolizumab is effective at maintaining clinical response. A significantly higher proportion of vedolizumab treated patients in both dosing regimens were in clinical response at Week 52 compared with patients who received placebo (p &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>As in the Induction Study, the prespecified secondary endpoint for mucosal healing during the Maintenance Study was defined as Mayo endoscopic subscore of ≤ 1 point. Using the prespecified definition, there was a 32.0% and 36.3% treatment difference favoring vedolizumab (Q8W and Q4W, respectively) over placebo. When analyzing only patients who had endoscopic subscore of 0, the results remain statistically significant. Given the lack of histologic data to support a labeling claim for "mucosal healing", the data provided would support a labeling claim of improved "endoscopic appearance of the mucosa".</p><p>Finally, the applicant provided data also provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that vedolizumab is effective in achieving corticosteroid-free clinical remission. Approximately 58% of patients in the Maintenance ITT population were receiving corticosteroids at Week 6, and a significantly higher proportion of patients from both vedolizumab arms were in clinical remission and on no corticosteroids at Week 52 than from the placebo group (p = 0.0120 for Q8W; p &lt; 0.0001 for Q4W). The sponsor's definition for corticosteroid free remission did not specify a minimum duration of time for which patients were required to be corticosteroid free, however, those patients who achieved sponsor defined corticosteroid-free remission at Week 52 were corticosteroid free for an average of 270 days (260 days ITT placebo, 267 days Q8W, and 274 days Q4W) compared to approximately 100 days (110 days ITT placebo, 97 days Q8W, and 94 days Q4W) for those who did not achieve this endpoint. In addition, 2 exploratory analyses were completed to analyze the proportion of patients who achieved continued remission and were corticosteroid free for 90 days and 180 days prior to Week 52, and these results were consistent with the secondary endpoint results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dosing</head><p>The applicant's dosing recommendations for vedolizumab are a dose of 300 mg administered as an IV infusion over 30 minutes at Week 0, Week 2, Week 6, and Q8W thereafter. The dosing recommendations go on to state that if clinical response is not The initial dosing recommendations are supported by data from C13006. Vedolizumab 300 mg was effective at inducing and maintaining clinical response and remission when administered at Week 0, Week 2, Week 6, and Q8W. Vedolizumab was also effective at maintaining clinical response and remission when dosed Q4W. Given that neither dosing regimen showed a clear efficacy or safety advantage, it is appropriate to treat with the lowest effective dose</p><p>The applicant's recommendation to consider dose escalation is based on PK data (vedolizumab trough data and PK modeling from Phase 3 studies) as well as information derived from Studies C13006 and C13008. An increase in dosing frequency for patients who fail to achieve clinical response by Week 6 was not formally studied as part of the applicant's Phase 3 program, however, and Study C13006 was not powered to directly compare the Q4W and Q8W doses. Study C13008 was open-label and not designed to assess efficacy endpoints, so efficacy data from this study should be considered with caution. Additional data is required to support the dosing escalation recommendations by the applicant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety</head><p>This reviewer believes vedolizumab has been shown to be safe for its intended use as recommended in the labeling. Overall, the safety profile of vedolizumab was adequately characterized during the clinical development program.</p><p>The proportion of patients with at least 1 AE was 84% in patients receiving vedolizumab, compared to 78% in patients receiving placebo. The most commonly reported AEs which occurred more commonly in the vedolizumab treated patients were nasopharyngitis, headache, arthralgia, nausea, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, and cough.</p><p>Nineteen percent (19%) of patients receiving vedolizumab throughout reported serious adverse events (SAEs) compared to 13% of patients who received placebo only. Serious infection AEs and those considered drug-related occurred with similar frequency between the vedolizumab and placebo groups (serious infection AE 4% and 3% respectively, and drug-related SAE 3% and 2%, respectively). The most frequently reported SAE (≥ 1% of the VDZ/VDZ population) in UC patients was related to underlying IBD (ulcerative colitis).</p><p>A higher proportion of patients in vedolizumab treated groups reported 1 or more infectious AE, than in the placebo groups, and this was largely driven by an increased rate of infections involving the upper respiratory and nasal mucosa (e.g., nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection) which were mild to moderate in Clinical Review Laurie Muldowney BLA 125476 Entyvio (vedolizumab) 14 severity. Serious infections were reported by 20 patients in C13006 and at a similar frequency between treatment groups (3% placebo only group; 2% vedolizumab).</p><p>Two cases of potential drug related liver toxicity were reported, one in Study C13006 and a second case in the C13008 120-day safety update. Case report information provided for both indicate a possible drug or autoimmune etiology. Additional information was requested of the applicant, including information on any additional cases of hepatitis or liver injury where drug induced or autoimmune hepatitis were considered in the differential was requested. Clinically significant liver injury has occurred with natalizumab use, and this potential adverse event should be included in the labeling and closely monitored in the postmarketing setting with consideration for enhanced pharmacovigilance. An addendum to this review will be provided following response from the applicant to our information request and further internal discussion.</p><p>Since 2007, the vedolizumab clinical development program included a Risk Assessment and Minimization for PML (RAMP) program. The RAMP program was thorough, and no cases of PML were identified through the 120 day safety data cutoff. This included 903 patients exposed to 24 or more vedolizumab infusions with 4-weeks of follow up and approximately 80% of whom received prior immunosuppressant therapy. Less than 1% of patients tested positive for JC viremia, and JCV antibody testing was not included in the RAMP program. There were 0 cases of PML identified during the vedolizumab clinical development program to date.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outstanding Issues</head><p>The Applicant adequately demonstrated the efficacy of vedolizumab and that the benefit of vedolizumab outweighs its potential risks for adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. Outstanding issues related to vedolizumab for ulcerative colitis include:</p><p> The key safety issue is the potential risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). There is uncertainty about the adequacy of the safety database to provide an acceptable pre-marketing assessment of this risk of PML or if continued risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (e.g., REMS) are needed in the postmarketing setting. This will be discussed at the Advisory Committee.  Two potential cases of drug related liver injury were reported. Additional information is forthcoming from the Applicant, and an addendum to this review will be provided. Enhanced pharmacovigilance in the postmarketing setting may be needed to ensure any future cases are captured.  Although a relationship between concomitant immunosuppressive therapies with infections was not found, there remains the concern that the risk of infections and of PML might be higher with concomitant immunosuppressive therapies. In the vedolizumab trials, these considerations led to the requirement that concomitant immunosuppressants will not be allowed beyond the induction phase (e.g., 6</p><p>Clinical Review Laurie Muldowney BLA 125476 Entyvio (vedolizumab) 16 risk. One could argue that labeling alone may be an appropriate strategy. Alternatively, an underlying risk for PML has not been seen in patients with UC and CD on other therapies, excluding natalizumab, and the risk for PML has not been entirely ruled out, with the safety database provided by the sponsor. While nonclinical data is reassuring in demonstrating the selectivity of vedolizumab's binding to the α4β7 integrin, the mechanism by which PML develops in patients administered integrin antagonist products is not completely understood and clinical data is needed to estimate risk.</p><p>It is unclear what evidentiary threshold we may be comfortable with, to rule out a specific level of risk of PML in these patients with a reasonable level of certainty. A critical question which will drive the selection of the optimal risk management strategy for vedolizumab is: considering the totality of the non-clinical and clinical evidence, how many vedolizumab patients need to be studied for how long to rule out the risk of PML with a reasonable level of certainty. If it is determined that the Applicant has not ruled out the potential of PML with a reasonable level of certainty, a REMS with ETASU may be needed. This approach will increase the burden on patients, prescribers, pharmacies, and infusion centers, and it is possible that vedolizumab may not address the unmet medical need in UC to the fullest extent possible. It would be important to discontinue the REMS program once a sufficient number of patients have been exposed, assuming no cases of PML arise.</p><p>Reviewer Comments: These issues will be discussed at the Advisory Committee on December 9, 2013, and I will provide an addendum to this review, pending the Advisory Committee recommendations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Recommendations for Postmarket Requirements and Commitments</head><p>At the time of this review, the following Postmarket Requirements and Commitments are recommended:</p><p>The Clinical Pharmacology review team recommends the following post marketing commitment (PMC) studies:  A study to reanalyze banked immunogenicity serum samples from ulcerative colitis trial C13006 and Crohn's disease trial C13007 to determine the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) using an improved ADA assay format with reduced sensitivity to product interference. This recommendation is based on the finding of inadequate assessment of immunogenicity incidence in the current BLA.  Evaluate the disease-drug-drug interaction (DDDI) potential between vedolizumab and other CYP substrates. This recommendation is based on the current understanding that CYP enzymes expression is suppressed by inflammatory cytokines associated with inflammatory conditions, and they can normalize upon improvement of the inflammatory conditions. We recommend a step-wise approach. For instance, one can conduct a study to first define the impact of UC or CD, an inflammatory disease condition, on the exposure of CYP 17 substrate drugs (i.e., the disease drug interaction). Such study may involve evaluating the exposures of CYP substrate drugs in healthy subjects and in subjects with severe UC or CD disease. In the event that the disease drug interaction is deemed clinically meaningful, the impact of vedolizumab treatment on observed disease drug interaction as measured by the exposure of CYP substrate drugs can be further evaluated in a subsequent study to evaluate the DDDI.</p><p>The following study is recommended from the Pediatric and Maternal Health Staff as a PMC:  Conduct a milk-only lactation trial in lactating women receiving vedolizumab therapeutically to assess concentrations of vedolizumab in breast milk using a validated assay in order to appropriately inform the Nursing Mother's subsection of labeling</p><p>In addition,  The applicant has requested a Waiver of Pediatric Study for pediatric patients from birth to and a Deferral of Pediatric Study for pediatric patients to &lt; 18.</p><p>Reviewer comment: We generally have waived requirements for pediatric studies of UC treatments in children under the age of 5 years due to the low UC incidence in that age group. The final determination of pediatric waiver and deferral will be made upon presentation to the Pediatric Research Committee (PeRC) as part of the review of this BLA for moderately to severely active UC in adults.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Introduction and Regulatory Background</head><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease of the rectal and colonic mucosa, which is characterized by clinical remissions and exacerbations resulting from intestinal inflammation. The typical age of onset for UC is between the ages of 15 and 30, and over 450,000 people in the United States (US) may be affected. Symptoms can vary depending on the severity of inflammation and extent of disease; however, patients typically experience recurrent episodes of rectal bleeding and diarrhea, often associated with crampy abdominal pain and tenesmus. Symptoms are often followed by periods of remission, which may be spontaneous or as a result of treatment. Patients may also exhibit systemic symptoms including fever, malaise, and weight loss; and severe colitis can result in ischemic colitis requiring surgical colectomy. Colectomy is considered curative in UC, but it is associated with significant morbidity, including recurrent pouchitis in up to 25% of patients, fecal incontinence, and female Reference ID: 3410494 <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">BLA 125476  Entyvio (vedolizumab)   18</ref> infertility. Finally, patients with long-standing UC are at increased risk for colorectal cancer. The goals of UC treatment are to induce and maintain remission of clinical symptoms and mucosal inflammation in order to improve quality of life, decrease hospitalizations, and reduce the risk of surgery and colon cancer. <ref type="bibr">(Hoentjen F, et al., Curr Gastroenterol Rep 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">13:475-485)</ref> The treatment options for UC are dictated by the severity of clinical symptoms and the anatomic extent of disease. Patients with mild to moderate UC are typically treated with topical and oral aminosalicylates, as well as topical steroids. Oral corticosteroids may be required in patients who are refractory to these treatments or who are systemically ill and require more rapid treatment. Immunomodulators such as azathioprine and mercaptopurine can be considered for patients not responding to or dependent on oral corticosteroids and for those who relapse on aminosalicylates.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(b) (4) (b) (4)</formula></div>

Vedolizumab specifically targets the human lymphocyte integrin α4β7, blocking its interaction with mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) which is expressed on the endothelium of intestinal vasculature. Applicant's proposed indications for ulcerative colitis:  Vedolizumab is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms, inducing and maintaining clinical response, clinical remission, and mucosal healing, and achieving corticosteroid-free remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist.</p><p>Applicants proposed dosing regimens:  300 mg infused intravenously over approximately 30 minutes at zero, two and six weeks, then every eight weeks thereafter</p></div>

Tysabri contains a boxed warning that it increases the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an opportunistic viral infection of the brain that usually leads to death or severe disability. Cases of PML have been reported in patients taking Tysabri who were recently or concomitantly treated with immunomodulators or immunosuppressants, as well as in patients receiving Tysabri as monotherapy.</p><p>As per the current label for Tysabri, three factors that are known to increase the risk of PML in Tysabri-treated patients have been identified:</p><p>(1) Longer treatment duration, especially beyond 2 years. There is limited experience in patients who have received more than years of TYSABRI treatment.</p><p>(2) Prior treatment with an immunosuppressant (e.g., mitoxantrone, azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil). Because of the risk of PML, Tysabri has a REMS requirement composed of a Medication Guide, Communication Plan, and Elements to Assure Safe Use including prescriber, pharmacy, and patient registration. Tysabri is available only through a special restricted distribution program called the CD Tysabri Outreach Unified Commitment to Health (TOUCH™) program. This program includes infusion site training and maintains a computerized database that captures enrollment, patient tracking, and drug distribution.</p><p>In addition to increasing the risk of PML, hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred in patients receiving Tysabri and were more frequent in patients with antibodies to Tysabri. Tysabri may also increase the risk for infections, including urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and gastroenteritis.</p><p>At the time of approval for CD, one of the post-marketing commitments (PMCs) was for a prospective observational study (CD INFORM) that specified that at least 2,000 CD patients must be enrolled, and that a least 1,000 patients must have two years of Tysabri treatment. CD INFORM was designed primarily to determine the incidence and pattern of serious and/or clinically significant infections, malignancies, and other serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) treated with natalizumab; the main safety outcome of interest in CD INFORM is PML. At the time of this review, the accrual of the study has been limited by the use of the marketed product in CD, and a total of only 187 subjects have been enrolled. Additional data is not yet available. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Summary of Presubmission Regulatory Activity Related to Submission</head><p>Clinical development of vedolizumab began in 1998, and IND 9125 was opened in June 2000 to initiate clinical development in the US. In January 2006, development of vedolizumab was placed on clinical hold due to concerns that integrin antagonists might predispose patients to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). This stemmed from the market withdrawal of natalizumab, following 2 cases of confirmed PML in patients receiving the drug to treat MS and one reported case in a patient treated for Crohn's disease. All integrin antagonists under development in the US at that time were placed on clinical hold. The clinical hold on IND 009125 was lifted in July 2007 with the implementation of an active screening and monitoring program. Multiple subsequent regulatory meetings, including an Advisory Committee (AC) meeting, have focused on risk minimization and safety monitoring related to potential PML risk, and the major agreements and recommendations are summarized below.</p><p>A Joint Meeting of the Gastrointestinal Advisory Committee (GIDAC) and the Drug Safety and Risk Management (DSaRM) Advisory Committee to evaluate intravenous vedolizumab for treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (induction and maintenance of Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis) and the risk of PML was held on July 20, 2011. The purpose of this closed session Advisory committee was to seek the committee's recommendations regarding the Phase 3 study design for vedolizumab, including the number of patients and duration of study needed to exclude the risk of PML. The following recommendations and responses were provided by the expert committee, in response to 4 questions:</p><p> The committee voted 12 to 5, with one abstention, that the available nonclinical and human pharmacodynamic data for vedolizumab do not provide assurance of less risk of PML than natalizumab.  The committee commented on an acceptable safety database size for preapproval assessment of PML risk in patients with CD and UC. No consensus was reached, however, the AC strongly expressed that the duration of exposure is important and that 24 months could be considered as the minimum duration timeframe. The majority of the committee felt that increasing the sample size has merit.  The committee voted 15 to 2, with one abstention, that the available nonclinical and clinical data do not support making the entry criteria less stringent for vedolizumab phase 3 studies (i.e., allow entry of patients that have not yet been treated with TNFα antagonists or immunosuppressants).  The committee voted 17 to 0, with one abstention, that restrictions on concomitant immunosuppressants (prohibited beyond the induction phase of vedolizumab treatment) should not be made less stringent.</p><p>Based on the AC recommendations and over the course of several meetings between the sponsor and FDA, the following major agreements were made relating to the risk of PML with this class of therapy: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>23</head><p> patient screening and monitoring: a screening baseline neurologic exam with exclusion of those with abnormal findings, education of site personnel and patients, and updated informed consent documents  selection criteria: patients enrolled in phase 3 studies in the United States were required to meet the stricter requirement of inadequate response or intolerance to immunosuppressants or TNFα antagonists, rather than immunosuppressants, TNFα antagonists, or corticosteroids  concomitant medications: in the US, patients in phase 3 studies were allowed concomitant steroid use for one and one-half years, with tapering at week 6 in patients that are in clinical response, or when clinical response is achieved. In addition, concomitant immunosuppressant use was allowed for up to 6 weeks in Phase 3 studies, but must be otherwise prohibited.  safety database: the safety database at the time of original BLA submission must include data on at least 900 patients that received ≥ 24 infusions, with a minimum of 4 weeks of follow-up after the last infusion. The Division anticipated this would result in ~1000 patients at the time of the 120-day safety update and for assessment by the Advisory Committee.</p><p>Several formal meetings also occurred between the sponsor and FDA to discuss manufacturing changes. Vedolizumab was initially manufactured utilizing a mouse myeloma (NS0) cell line, and initial clinical studies used drug product from this process (MLN02, Process A). A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line was developed to improve productivity, and drug product from this process (MLN0002, Process B) was used in multiple Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies. Further manufacturing improvements to the CHO-based process were then implemented to establish a commercially representative process (MLN0002, Process C) that was used to supply Phase 3 clinical trials. A PK/PD comparability study was completed prior to initiating Phase 3 studies, to compare Process B and C products. For simplicity, "vedolizumab" will be used throughout this review to refer to the drug product throughout its development.</p><p>Presubmission regulatory activities related to this submission included an advisory committee meeting and 14 formal face-to-face meetings between the sponsor and FDA. In addition, there were a number of teleconferences and written correspondences exchanged during the development program for ulcerative colitis. The sponsor was granted Fast Track Designation in February 2013. Cynomolgus monkeys and humans. In vitro studies utilizing human and murine cell lines selectively expressing specific integrins demonstrated the specificity of vedolizumab for binding to the α4β7 integrin and not α4β1 or αEβ7 integrin. The selectivity of vedolizumab for inhibition of α4β7-mediated cell adhesion interactions was also examined and showed that vedolizumab inhibited α4β7-MAdCAM-1 and fibronectin and did not inhibit α4β7-VCAM-1, α4β1-VCAM-1, or α4β1-fibronectin-mediated adhesive interactions.</p><p>In vitro studies also demonstrated that vedolizumab did not mediate antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or complement dependent cytotoxicity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In addition, vedolizumab did not induce T lymphocyte activation or cytokine release. Tissue cross-reactivity studies were conducted using a panel of monkey and human tissues, and no unanticipated tissue cross reactivity was observed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In Vivo Pharmacology</head><p>An animal efficacy study was conducted in Tamarin monkeys with naturally occurring chronic colitis using ACT-1 (murine homologue of vedolizumab). ACT-1 treatment resulted in resolution of diarrhea in all animals by Day 3 and colonic mucosal biopsies on Day 5 showed ACT-1 localization to the α4β7 + lymphocytes in the lamina propria. Biopsy results also revealed reduced mucosal density of α4β7 + lymphocytes from Day 5 to Day 20. Control animals had no clinical or immunohistologic improvement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Toxicology</head><p>Toxicity studies were conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys. Lymphoplasmacytic gastritis was observed in both MLN0002 and control monkeys in a 26-week study, though MLN0002 treated monkeys had greater regeneration of superficial mucosal epithelium in response to this gastritis. The significance of this is not known. Balantidium coli (parasites) were observed in the cecum and colon of both control and vedolizumab treated monkeys, and no dose response in vedolizumab treated monkeys was observed.</p><p>In a 3-month toxicity study of New Zealand white rabbits, no differences were noted between control animals and those treated with vedolizumab. A reproduction study in pregnant New Zealand white rabbits showed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus with vedolizumab administration on gestation day 7 at single IV doses up to 100 mg/kg. Similarly, a pre and postnatal development study with vedolizumab in monkeys showed no evidence of any adverse effect on pre and postnatal development at IV doses up to 100 mg/kg. there is no animal model of PML) to assess the impact of vedolizumab and natalizumab on CNS immune surveillance. The results of this study showed that while natalizumab appeared to inhibit immune surveillance of the CNS, vedolizumab had no such effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Nonclinical Studies</head><p>In addition, a 3-week comparative immunotoxicity study of natalizumab and vedolizumab was completed in Cynomolgus monkeys. Natalizumab caused a significant increase in lymphocyte populations (e.g., b-lymphocytes, t-helper lymphocytes, etc.), whereas there was no change in these populations in vedolizumabtreated monkeys.</p><p>There are no major efficacy or safety issues from nonclinical, which recommends approval.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Clinical Pharmacology</head><p>The Clinical Pharmacology review team found the information submitted to support this BLA to be acceptable with the following recommendations for post marketing commitment (PMC) studies:  A study to reanalyze banked immunogenicity serum samples from ulcerative colitis trial C13006 and Crohn's disease trial C13007 to determine the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) using an improved ADA assay format with reduced sensitivity to product interference. This recommendation is based on the finding of inadequate assessment of immunogenicity incidence in the current BLA.  Evaluate the disease-drug-drug interaction (DDDI) potential between vedolizumab and other CYP substrates. This recommendation is based on the current understanding that CYP enzymes expression is suppressed by inflammatory cytokines associated with inflammatory conditions, and they can normalize upon improvement of the inflammatory conditions. We recommend a step-wise approach. For instance, one can conduct a study to first define the impact of UC or CD, an inflammatory disease condition, on the exposure of CYP substrate drugs (i.e., the disease drug interaction). Such study may involve evaluating the exposures of CYP substrate drugs in healthy subjects and in subjects with severe UC or CD disease. In the event that the disease drug interaction is deemed clinically meaningful, the impact of vedolizumab treatment on observed disease drug interaction as measured by the exposure of CYP substrate drugs can be further evaluated in a subsequent study to evaluate the DDDI. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.1">Mechanism of Action</head><p>Vedolizumab is a recombinant humanized IgG1 antibody which selectively binds α4β7 integrin, a glycoprotein on the surface of leukocytes which are involved in GI mucosal immunity. Vedolizumab blocks the interaction of human lymphocyte integrin α4β7 with its ligand, mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), which is expressed on the endothelium of intestinal vasculature. This inhibits the migration of these leukocytes into the GI mucosa and thus decreases the inflammation associated with UC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.2">Pharmacodynamics</head><p>Study C13002 assessed the relationship between vedolizumab serum concentrations and the extent of α4β7 binding saturation in three dose cohorts (2, 6, and 10 mg/kg). Subjects received a total of 4 vedolizumab doses administered at Days 1, 14, 29, and 85. Maximum binding saturation (i.e., near 100% inhibition of MAdCAM-1-Fc binding to α4β7) occurred within one hour of vedolizumab administration at all dose levels, suggesting that maximum inhibition of α4β7 is unrelated to dose. Maximum inhibition persisted throughout treatment until 84, 126, and 112 days after the last dose for the 2, 6, and 10 mg/kg dose cohorts, respectively. The significance of the saturation of the α4β7 receptor is only one factor related to drug efficacy. These results suggest that near-maximum α4β7 binding will be maintained with the recommended dosing regimen of 300 mg Q8W.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.3">Pharmacokinetics</head><p>Vedolizumab exhibits target-mediated drug disposition leading to decreased clearance with increasing doses, due to target saturation. However, the exposure was approximately dose-proportional over the dose range of 2 to 10 mg/kg, following repeated dose administration in UC patients. The mean apparent terminal half-life was approximately 25 days at 300 mg dose. The population PK analysis showed disease severity, body weight, serum albumin, age, prior TNFα antagonist therapy, and concomitant medications had no clinically meaningful impact on PK.</p><p>The clinical pharmacology assessment found the proposed dosing regimen (i.e., 300 mg at Weeks 0, 2, 6 and Q8W thereafter) acceptable based on exposure response data. The exposure response analysis in Study C13006 was based on the ITT population, where the trough concentration was used as the exposure variable and 32 clinical remission at both Weeks 6 and 52 was used as the primary response variable. A significant relationship was established between clinical remission at Week 6 and vedolizumab Week 6 trough concentration using logistic relationship. This may suggest that higher exposures is associated with higher efficacy, however, the clinical pharmacology reviewer suggests that the exposure-response relationships are confounded by several risk factors (e.g., TNFα antagonist use, concomitant medications) which are not well balanced across the concentration quartiles at Week 6. No exposure-response relationships were evident between clinical remission at Week 52 and vedolizumab trough concentrations. This is consistent with the lack of doseresponse observed between the Q4W and Q8W dosing regimens at Week 52.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.4">Immunogenicity</head><p>The immunogenicity of vedolizumab could not be reliably assessed during clinical development due to drug interference in the immunogenicity assay. The drug tolerance level of the immunogenicity assay (500 ng/mL) was significantly less than the mean vedolizumab steady state trough concentrations during clinical trials, so the incidence of ADA were likely to be underestimated during treatment. For example, 4% of patients who received continuous vedolizumab in Studies C13006 and C13007 developed antidrug antibodies at any time during treatment; however, 17% of patients who received vedolizumab during induction but placebo during the maintenance phase had ADAs at Week 52, when drug levels were undetectable. Since ADAs could degrade during this time period, 17% may still be an underestimation of the true immunogenicity rate. There were 8 patients with persistently positive ADA, and none of these patients achieved clinical remission at Weeks 6 or 52 in controlled trials. Seven of these subjects had available drug concentration data which showed undetectable vedolizumab concentrations in 5 patients and reduced vedolizumab concentrations in 2 patients. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design</head><p>Trial C13006 was a Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of both induction and maintenance treatment with vedolizumab in 895 patients with moderately to severely active UC. This trial was conducted under a single protocol but designed and analyzed as 2 separate studies: C13006 Induction Study and C13006 Maintenance Study.</p><p>The overall study consisted of a 6-week Induction Phase which included study drug dosing at weeks 0 and 2 and endpoint assessments at Week 6 followed by a Maintenance Phase which began with study drug dosing at Week 6 and concluded with Week 52 assessments 1 . Patients who completed through Week 52 or withdrew early due to sustained nonresponse, disease worsening, or the need for rescue medications were eligible to enroll in an open label extension study, Study C13008. Those not participating in Study C13008 were to complete a final safety visit 16 weeks after the last dose of study drug and participate in a 2-year follow-up survey. The 6-week Induction Phase consisted of two cohorts of patients. Cohort 1 patients determined to be eligible at screening were randomized 3:2 to treatment with doubleblind vedolizumab 300mg IV or placebo, at Weeks 0 and 2. Randomization was stratified for two factors:</p><p> concomitant use of oral corticosteroids  previous exposure to TNFα antagonists or concomitant immunomodulator (6mercaptopurine or azathioprine) use.</p><p>The efficacy analyses of vedolizumab for the Induction Study include data from Cohort 1 only. After enrollment in Cohort 1 was complete, patients were enrolled into Cohort 2 to ensure that the sample size of induction responders would be sufficient to power the Maintenance Study efficacy endpoints. Patients in Cohort 2 received open label vedolizumab 300mg IV at weeks 0 and 2 and were assessed at Week 6 to determine if they were eligible for the Maintenance Study.</p><p>All patients from the Induction Phase continue on to the Maintenance Phase and were included in the maintenance safety database. Patients from both Induction cohorts who received vedolizumab and achieved clinical response at Week 6 were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to double-blind treatment with vedolizumab every 4 weeks (Q4W), vedolizumab every 8 weeks (Q8W), or placebo. Randomization was stratified for three factors:  enrollment in Cohort 1 or 2 of the Induction Phase  concomitant use of oral corticosteroids  previous exposure to TNFα antagonists or concomitant immunomodulator (6mercaptopurine or azathioprine) use. The Maintenance Study efficacy analyses include data from these randomized patients only.</p><p>Vedolizumab-treated patients who did not demonstrate response at Week 6 of the Induction Phase continued with vedolizumab infusions every 4 weeks through Week 52 and were included in exploratory analyses evaluating delayed clinical response at Weeks 10 and 14, as well as safety assessments. In addition, patients who received double-blind placebo during the Induction Phase continued on placebo infusions every 4 weeks during the Maintenance Phase, regardless of treatment response, and were included in the safety assessments. Data from all patients were included in the safety analysis. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">Figure 3</ref> shows the overall trial design of C13006.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.4">Treatment</head><p>Patients received vedolizumab or placebo by IV infusion according to their treatment assignment. All infusions were to be administered IV over approximately 30 minutes under the supervision of the investigator or identified designee(s). Longer infusion times of up to 60 minutes were permitted in individual patients based on intolerance to shorter infusion times. Patients were to be observed for 2 hours post-infusion of the first dose and 1 hour after completion of subsequent doses.</p><p>Induction Phase:  Intention to treat population: Patients randomized to vedolizumab were to receive vedolizumab 300 mg at Weeks 0 and 2. Patients randomized to placebo were to receive 250 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride IV at Weeks 0 and 2.  Cohort 2: All patients from Cohort 2 were to receive open-label vedolizumab 300 mg at Weeks 0 and 2. Reviewer comment: Infusion reactions could have the potential to affect the blinding if they occurred disproportionately in the vedolizumab treatment groups, however, investigator-defined infusion-related events were uncommon in Study C13006. Infusion events did occur more frequently in vedolizumab treated patients (5% of combined vedolizumab patients vs 1% of placebo), but this reviewer believes given the low numbers this will not impact the efficacy results.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Induction Phase</head><p>The baseline demographics in the induction phase were similar across treatment arms and between Cohorts. Fifty-nine percent (59%) of patients were male and 82% were white. The mean age of study participants was 40.3 years old and the median weight was approximately 73 kilograms. About a third of overall patients were from North America with just over a quarter of overall patients from the US (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 10</ref>). For the maintenance efficacy analyses, the ITT population was defined as all randomized patients who received vedolizumab during the Induction Phase and met the protocol definition of clinical response at Week 6, as assessed by the investigator, were randomized, and received any amount of double-blind study drug in the Maintenance Phase. Patients from Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 were evenly distributed between treatment arms, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> below. There were 164 patients (44%) who discontinued from the Maintenance Study prior to completion, and the majority of these patients were from the placebo arm (78 patients, 62%). The primary reason for discontinuation was lack of efficacy, and more patients discontinued due to lack of efficacy from the placebo arm (61 patients, 48%) than from either vedolizumab arm (31 patients, 25% and 33 patients, 26% from the Q8W and Q4W, respectively). A greater number of patients in the placebo arm discontinued early for AEs as well; however, many of these AEs were disease related and likely represent lack of efficacy and not a true AE. See <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 16</ref> below, for additional details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Review</head><p>Laurie Muldowney BLA 125476 Entyvio (vedolizumab) 83 did not appear to be any clinical benefit to the use of concomitant immunomodulators, as patients appeared to respond similarly with or without their use.</p><p>In addition, the applicant analyzed a number of exploratory endpoints, including patient reported outcomes (i.e., IBDQ score, SF-36, EQ-5D), fecal calprotectin, and time to disease worsening, time to treatment failure, and reduction in oral corticosteroid use. Of note, the applicant compared delayed clinical response rates by partial Mayo score in patients who did not achieve clinical response at Week 6. Specifically, patients who received vedolizumab during the Induction Phase but did not respond at Week 6 were assigned to continue vedolizumab Q4W during the Maintenance Phase. These patients were compared to placebo patients who had not responded at Week 6 and continued treatment on placebo in the Maintenance Phase. In a post hoc analysis, the response rate in the patients receiving vedolizumab was higher than for placebo patients at both</p><p>Week 10 and Week 14. These endpoints were exploratory in nature, however, and would require independent validation in a well-controlled trial designed to assess these endpoints.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: As noted above, these endpoints are exploratory in nature and would not support a without independent validation in a well-controlled trial designed to specifically assess these endpoints. Furthermore, the Agency's Study Endpoint and Labeling Development (SEALD) Team has determined that the items and domains of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) are not appropriate, comprehensive, and interpretable relative to its intended use as a measure of healthrelated quality of life In addition, fecal calprotectin is not a validated surrogate endpoint for clinical outcomes in UC</p></div>

In phase 2 clinical studies in UC and CD patients (M200-22 and L299-016), the Applicant observed clinical remission at a dose where a near complete α 4 β 7 receptor blockade (&gt;96%) was achieved within one hour after dose. The Applicant subsequently selected a dose of 300 mg (roughly equivalent to 4 mg/kg for a 75 kg subject) for the phase 3 studies in order to achieve sustained blockade of the α 4 β 7 receptors.</p><p>The final dosing recommendations for vedolizumab are a dose of 300 mg administered as an IV infusion over 30 minutes at Week 0, Week 2, Week 6, and Q8W thereafter. These dosing recommendations are based on data from C13006, specifically:</p><p> 300 mg vedolizumab administered at Week 0 and Week 2 is effective in inducing clinical response and remission at 6 weeks.  The secondary Maintenance Study endpoints of durable clinical response and durable clinical remission considered only response/remission at Weeks 6 and 52 and thus provide little additional information on whether treatment benefits were consistently sustained throughout the 52-week duration of the trial. Data from exploratory endpoints, such as the proportion of patients at Week 52 who are in clinical remission and have been corticosteroid-free for 90 days and 180 days suggest that benefit was sustained throughout the Maintenance Phase.</p><p>The persistence of efficacy beyond 52 weeks was assessed by integrating data from C13006 and the open-label extension study C13008. Efficacy was summarized by partial Mayo score at approximately 6-month intervals in C13008. The changes from baseline in partial Mayo score beyond 52 weeks showed sustained decreases in partial Mayo from baseline, suggesting persistence of efficacy. These results must be considered with caution, however, given the open-label design of the study, potential confounders, and lack of adjustment for multiplicity in the trial.</p><p>Tolerance effects were also assessed through the exploratory endpoints analyzing time to disease worsening and time to treatment failure, and no evidence of tolerance was seen. These endpoints were exploratory, however, and should be considered with caution. Persistent HAHA titers were seen in a small number of patients and were associated with decreases in the serum concentration of vedolizumab (in C13006, 23 of 620 patients were HAHA positive on study drug). It is difficult to draw any conclusions regarding the impact of this on efficacy, given the small number of patients. Adverse events leading to clinical trial discontinuation was similar between the placebo groups and combined vedolizumab groups. The most common AEs resulting in study discontinuation from the combined group were ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.</p><p>One death (0.3%) occurred during the controlled clinical trial period in a patient receiving placebo, compared with 5 deaths (0.3%) in patients receiving vedolizumab. The events leading to death among the UC patients were respiratory failure, cerebrovascular accident, and pulmonary embolism. None of these events were determined to be related to study drug. Among the CD patients, traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, hepatic neoplasm, suicide, and sepsis led to patient deaths. Again, none of these deaths were determined to be related to the study drug, as per the clinical reviewer assessment.</p><p>The proportion of patients with at least 1 adverse event in studies C13006 and C13007 was 84%, 78% and 84% in the ITT placebo, non-ITT placebo, and combined vedolizumab group, respectively. The most commonly reported adverse events which occurred more commonly in the vedolizumab treated patients were nasopharyngitis, headache, arthralgia, nausea, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, and cough. All of these adverse events occurred in at least 5% of the combined vedolizumab group. The rates of common adverse events, when considered by patient-years, were similar between the combined vedolizumab group and the non-ITT placebo group. The frequency of nonserious AEs, categorized as "severe" was also similar across the 3 treatment groups in Studies C13006 and C13007. Thirteen percent of patients in the ITT placebo reported severe AEs, compared to 14% in the non-ITT placebo and 15% in the combined vedolizumab group. Crohn's disease, abdominal pain, and ulcerative colitis were the only AEs categorized as severe which were reported in at least 1% of the combined vedolizumab group, and these occurred at similar frequencies in the 3 treatment groups.</p><p>A higher proportion of patients in vedolizumab treated groups reported 1 or more infectious AE, than in the placebo groups. In both the UC and CD populations, infections involving the upper respiratory and nasal mucosa (e.g., nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection) were the most commonly reported infection and occurred with greater frequency in vedolizumab treated patients than placebo. There was no increase in serious infection related AEs seen. Oronasal-associated lymphocytes show primary α4β7 expression, suggesting the MAdCAM-1 interactions may have a role in nasal infections. The greater frequency of upper respiratory tract infections is consistent with vedolizumab's mechanism of action in inhibiting the α4β7-MAdCAM-1 interaction. There is the potential that this represents an off target event, however, and this should continue to be monitored in the post-marketing setting. Furthermore, labeling language indicating that vedolizumab is may be misleading.</p><p>Serious infections were reported in both controlled and open-label trials. Serious infections were more common in CD patients. In Study C13007, serious infections were reported in 5 (3%), 4 (3%), and 45 (6%) of patients in the VDZ/PLA, PLA/PLA, and VDZ/VDZ groups, respectively. Serious infections were reported by 20 patients in C13006 and at a similar frequency across dose groups (3% VDZ/PLA; 3% PLA/PLA; 2% VDZ/VDZ). Anal abscesses were the most frequently reported serious AE among One case of potential drug related liver toxicity was reported in Study C13006 and a second case with the 120-day safety update. Case report information provided for both indicate a possible drug or autoimmune etiology. Both patients were treated with corticosteroids and study drug was discontinued, complicating determination of etiology. Additional information was requested of the applicant, both on these two cases and any additional cases of hepatitis or liver injury where drug induced or autoimmune hepatitis were considered in the differential was requested. This information is pending at the time of this review. An addendum will be provided with pertinent information from the response to information request and following further internal discussions.</p><p>No apparent signals for increased risk for an adverse event or any type of adverse event when assessing AEs by a variety of demographic factors was seen, including age, sex, geographic region, and prior IBD treatments. Patients with previous TNFα use had a higher overall rate of AEs, however, the AE rates were similar between treatment groups in this subset.</p><p>Since 2007, the vedolizumab clinical development program included a Risk Assessment and Minimization for PML (RAMP) program. The RAMP program was thorough, and no cases of PML were identified through the 120 day safety data cutoff. This included 1004 patients exposed to 24 or more vedolizumab infusions with 4-weeks of follow up and approximately 80% of whom received prior immunosuppressant therapy. Less than 1% of patients tested positive for JC viremia; JCV antibody testing was not included in the RAMP program.</p></div>

This included 1279 patients with UC, 1850 patients with CD, and 197 healthy subjects. Safety data for vedolizumab will be presented focusing on the comparative safety data in UC patients (Clinical Trial C13006), combined comparative safety data in UC and CD patients (Clinical Trials C13006 and C13007,), and long term safety data (Clinical Trial C13008).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Long-term Safety</head><p>The long-term UC and CD safety population focuses on safety data from Trial C13008, a long term extension study evaluating safety with continued vedolizumab in patients with UC or CD. This long-term safety population (N= 2243) includes both rollover patients (N=1822) and de novo patients (N=421). For patients who received vedolizumab in qualifying clinical trials and rolled into C13008, the frequency of AEs was analyzed across the originating trial and Trial C13008. For patients who received placebo during the previous trial, AEs were not counted during the time of placebo administration. For these patients and de novo patients, all AEs were summarized from the first dose of vedolizumab.</p><p>Exposure data and presentation of deaths and other specifically relevant AEs (i.e., PML) will use the entire safety population, controlled and uncontrolled studies in patients and healthy volunteers.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">24, 2013)</ref>). Given the potential risk for PML with this class of agents, however, the applicant was recommended to provide a significantly larger safety database. The final recommendation from the Division was that a minimum of 900 patients should have received ≥ 24 infusions with 4 weeks postinfusion follow up, in order to provide a pre-approval assessment of PML risk in patients with UC and CD that would be adequate to take to Advisory Committee for consideration.</p><p>A total of 3326 subjects had received at least 1 dose of vedolizumab in the clinical development program as of June 27, 2013. This included 1279 patients with UC, 1850 patients with CD, and 197 healthy subjects. Across all clinical studies, 2022 patients were exposed to vedolizumab for ≥ 6 months, 1418 patients for ≥ 12 months, 906 for ≥ 24 months, and 407 for ≥ 36 months. Patients were exposed to vedolizumab for a mean of 480.6 days in Phase 2 and 3 studies combined and for a mean of 532.0 days in phase 3 trials combined. Due to the increased risk of PML with natalizumab, an integrin receptor antagonist, other products with similar mechanisms of action may also be at increased risk for this rare but serious demyelinating disease caused by reactivation of latent JC virus infection in the central nervous system (CNS). The applicant completed nonclinical studies aimed at characterizing the binding specificity and selective antagonism of vedolizumab in order to support that vedolizumab has a lower risk of causing PML than natalizumab.</p><p>Vedolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to α4β7 integrin, a glycoprotein present on the surface of leukocytes involved in GI mucosal immunity. The ligand of α4β7 integrin is mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), which is preferentially expressed on the endothelium of GI mucosa. The mechanism of action of vedolizumab is the inhibition of leukocyte migration to the GI mucosa and interaction with MAdCAM-1. Natalizumab, in contrast, binds to the α4 integrin subunit and thus binds both α4β7 and α4β1, which binds to the endothelial ligand vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). An in vitro study utilizing cell lines selectively expressing specific integrins showed that vedolizumab selectively binds to α4β7 and does not bind to α4β1 or αEβ7 integrin. This study also examined the selectivity of vedolizumab for inhibition of α4β7-mediated cell adhesion interactions and showed that vedolizumab inhibited α4β7-MAdCAM-1 and fibronectin and did not inhibit α4β7-VCAM-1, α4β1-VCAM-1, or α4β1-fibronectin-mediated adhesive interactions.</p><p>A decrease in immune surveillance of the CNS by T-lymphocytes is hypothesized to contribute to the development of PML. The sponsor conducted a study using an Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in Rhesus monkeys (a model of multiple sclerosis; there is no animal model of PML) to assess the impact of vedolizumab and natalizumab on CNS immune surveillance. The results of this study showed that while natalizumab appeared to inhibit immune surveillance of the CNS, vedolizumab had no such effect. In addition, a 3-week comparative immunotoxicity study of natalizumab and vedolizumab was completed in Cynomolgus monkeys. Natalizumab caused a significant increase in lymphocyte populations (e.g., blymphocytes, t-helper lymphocytes, etc.), whereas there was no change in these populations in vedolizumab-treated monkeys.</p><p>The applicant proposes that their nonclinical data supports the specificity of vedolizumab and the use of vedolizumab does not carry the same increased risk of PML as natalizumab.</p><p>See nonclinical pharmacology/toxicology section 4.3 for routine animal and in vitro testing performed and the Nonclinical Review by Tamal Chakraborti, PhD, for additional details.</p><p>Reviewer comment: The nonclinical data supports the specificity of vedolizumab, however, the mechanism by which PML develops in patients administered integrin antagonist products is not completely understood. Clinical data is required to support that the differences in receptor binding, etc., result in a decreased PML risk. See section 7.3.5 for additional information.</p></div>

As in the overall population, a larger proportion of patients in the VDZ/VDZ group (43%) experienced at least 1 infectious AE, compared to 36% in the non-ITT placebo group. The most commonly reported AEs were similar in the subgroup of patients with baseline concomitant use of immunomodulators and/or corticosteroids and included nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, and urinary tract infections.</p></div>

In addition to the information summarized above, there were 4 reports of tuberculosis among patients treated with vedolizumab which all occurred in the first 18 months of treatment. Three patients in Study C13008 were diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis. All three patients were on concomitant corticosteroids, and two were also receiving concomitant azathioprine. All patients had negative screenings for TB at enrollment, so none of these cases were considered to be reactivation of latent disease, and all three patients live in countries with higher endemic rates of TB relative to the US (Russia, South Korea, and India). All were considered to be primary infections, and no extrapulmonary manifestations were reported. In addition, one CD patient from the Czech Republic who was previously treated with azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and systemic corticosteroids was diagnosed with latent tuberculosis. Two days after his final of 3 doses of vedolizumab, the patient had a nonproductive cough; chest X-ray was negative, but mycobacterium T complex tests confirmed a latent TB infection.

In addition, this Reviewer recommends that a determination of circulating CD34+ cells (a marker of immaturity) in response to the administration of vedolizumab should be included. Further, this Reviewer recommends ((pending discussion with the CBER immunologist consulted, Dr. Jennifer Reed) that determination of IgA and IgM in nasopharyngeal samples should be included as a substudy in the proposed observational postmarketing study.Vedolizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that belongs to the class of integrin antagonist drugs. Vedolizumab specifically targets the human lymphocyte integrin α4β7, blocking its interaction with mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) which is expressed on the endothelium of intestinal vasculature.Currently available approved treatments for moderately to severely active CD appear in the table below.</note></figure>

Despite the small numbers of patients who were naïve to TNFα antagonist therapy (50 placebo; 51 vedolizumab), treatment differences were observed favoring vedolizumab for all analyses (exploratory analyses; nominally significant p values) except for enhanced clinical response at Week 6, where a trend was observed with a 15% difference favoring vedolizumab treatment over placebo.At the request of DGIEP, post hoc analyses of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints at Week 52 of the Maintenance Study were performed by Induction Phase cohort (Cohort 1[blinded]  or Cohort 2 [open label].

The Applicant makes this recommendation based on PK data (vedolizumab trough data and PK modeling from Phase 3 studies) as well as information derived from Studies C13006 and C13008. Thirty-two patients in the vedolizumab Q8W treatment arm of the Maintenance Phase of C13006 withdrew prematurely due to lack of efficacy and switched to vedolizumab Q4W dosing in Study C13008. The clinical remission rate for these patients was 6.0% (2/32) at Week 0 based on partial Mayo and increased to 25.0% (8/32) at Weeks 28 and 52. These results must be considered with caution, however, given the small numbers and open-label design of study C13008. Discussion of Persistence of Efficacy and/or Tolerance Effects Data from Study C13006 demonstrates the efficacy of vedolizumab at 52 weeks of treatment, as described in sections 6.1.4 and 6.1.5. It is difficult to comment on whether the therapeutic activity achieved was consistently sustained throughout the 52 week period, without endpoints including time periods throughout the Maintenance Phase. The applicant summarized clinical remission rates by study visit, based on partial Mayo score, however. The number of patients with clinical remission appeared to remain stable for vedolizumab treated patients through Week 52, while the number of placebo patients in clinical remission declined steadily from Week 10 through Week 52. This is shown inFigure 7below.</figDesc><table><row><cell>BEST AVAILABLE COPY</cell></row><row><cell>Clinical Review Laurie Muldowney BLA 125476 Entyvio (vedolizumab)  Reviewer comments: Exploring lower doses in phase 2 studies may have helped to better characterize the exposure response relationship, however the clinical data supports the efficacy of vedolizumab 300 mg Q8W and Q4W for the maintenance of clinical remission and response. While both doses are effective, it is appropriate to treat with the lowest effective dose. An increase in dosing frequency for patients who fail to achieve clinical response by Week 6 was not formally studied as part of the applicant's Phase 3 program. Furthermore, Study C13006 was not powered to compare the Q4W and Q8W doses. Please see the Clinical Pharmacology Review for additional details on dose-response and dose selection.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_75"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Overall, the safety profile of vedolizumab was adequately characterized during the clinical development program. A total of 3326 subjects had received at least 1 dose of vedolizumab in the clinical development program as of March 14, 2013, the cut-off date for inclusion of safety data in the BLA. This included 1004 UC and CD patients who had received 24 or more infusions of vedolizumab with 4-weeks of follow-up.In Clinical Trial C13006, the rates of adverse events were similar in the ITT populations, with 84% of patients in the placebo arm having any adverse event, compared to 82% and 81% in the Q8W and Q4W arms, respectively. More patients in the placebo-ITT arm reported a serious adverse event (16%) than in either of the vedolizumab-ITT arms (Q8W 8%, Q4W 9%). Similarly, a greater proportion of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events in both placebo arms (placebo-ITT 12%, placebo non-ITT 11%) than in the combined vedolizumab group (6%). When combining results from the UC and CD populations (Studies C13006 and C13007) the results were similar. The proportion of patients with at least 1 adverse event was 84%, 78% and 84% in the ITT placebo, non-ITT placebo, and combined vedolizumab groups, respectively. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 19% of patients receiving vedolizumab throughout, compared to 13% of patients who received placebo only. Serious infection AEs and those considered drug-related occurred with similar frequency between the vedolizumab and placebo groups (serious infection AE 4% and 3% respectively, and drug-related SAE 3% and 2%, respectively). The most frequently reported SAEs (≥ 1% of the VDZ/VDZ population) were related to underlying IBD and included Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and anal abscess. The higher proportion of patients reporting at least 1 SAE in the vedolizumab group was largely driven by SAE reporting in C13007. There was a higher overall rate of SAEs in Trial C13007 for Crohn's disease, with 199 (24%) of patients in the combined vedolizumab group reporting at least 1 SAE, compared to 23 (16%) in the non-ITT placebo group.</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="2">Clinical Review</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Laurie Muldowney</cell></row><row><cell>BLA 125476</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Entyvio (vedolizumab)</cell></row><row><cell>6.1.10</cell><cell>Additional Efficacy Issues/Analyses</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">There are no additional efficacy issues/analyses.</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">7 Review of Safety</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Safety Summary</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>88</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

See section 7.1 for additional details. Blood samples for JC viremia were obtained.  Vital Signs: Heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and temperature.  Electrocardiogram: A 12-lead ECG was obtained at rest were obtained and any findings from ECGs collected after study drug administration were to be captured as AEs if there was a clinically significant change from baseline. Importantly, since 2007, all patients enrolled in vedolizumab trials have been actively monitored for PML through the Risk Assessment and Minimization for PML (RAMP) program. This program included investigator and patient education, required screening prior to enrollment, frequent and regular screenings, and evaluations of any new, unexplained neurological symptoms, as necessary. For example, prior to entering the trial, patients were administered a Subjective Checklist (seeTable 42, below) including relevant neurologic signs and symptoms. Patients with one or more positive result at baseline were excluded from the clinical trial. The same Subjective Checklist was also administered at each visit prior to study drug administration and at the Final Safety visit. For any patients with 1 or more positive responses on the Subjective Checklist, an objective test (Objective Checklist) was to be administered by the investigator. Appropriate safety evaluations were performed as part of the drug development program. The RAMP program adequately assessed for signs and symptoms of PML in clinical trial participants in order to identify potential cases early.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Clinical Review Laurie Muldowney BLA 125476 Entyvio (vedolizumab) absolute lymphocyte count, absolute monocyte count, and absolute neutrophil count o clinical chemistry: albumin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, amylase, bicarbonate, BUN, calcium, creatinine, glucose, lipase, magnesium, phosphorus, total and direct bilirubin, total protein, sodium, potassium, and chloride o coagulation: prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time  Immunogenicity testing: Blood samples for human antihuman antibodies (HAHA) were obtained at protocol-specified visits to evaluate the potential immunogenicity of vedolizumab.

Ulcerative colitis was reported in 64 patients in the Maintenance Phase overall, and the highest rates were reported in the non-ITT groups; 10 placebo patients (7%) and 40 non-ITT vedolizumab patients (11%) reported ulcerative colitis as a serious AE. Infections reported as SAEs were seen in 2-3% of patients, and there were no notable differences between treatment arms. SAEs which were reported by greater than 1 patient by PT are summarized below. binding sites are predominantly in the gastrointestinal tract but are also distributed in the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal tissue (Csencsits KL, et al, Mucosal addressin expression and binding-interactions with naïve lymphocytes vary among the cranial, oral and nasal-associated lymphoid tissues, Eur J Immunol 2002. 32:3029-3039). Based on this distribution, an increased rate of upper respiratory tract infections may be expected -this is believed to be related to the known mechanism of action and targets of vedolizumab and not related to immunosuppression. Similarly, given vedolizumab's mechanism of action and inhibition of lymphocyte trafficking to the GI tract, there is a risk of increased GI infections, as well as systemic infections from enteric pathogens such as Listeria, Salmonella, and C. difficile and Campylobacter. ITT placebo group (31%). The most commonly reported HLT were upper respiratory tract infections, and this appears to have driven the difference in frequency of infections between groups. Other infection HLTs reported in ≥ 4% of patients in the combined vedolizumab arm were lower respiratory tract and lung infections, influenza viral infections, and abdominal and gastrointestinal infections. A similar proportion of patients reported these events in each of the treatment arms. The proportion of patients with infection was higher in the ITT vedolizumab Q8W dosing regimen (51%) compared to the ITT Q4W regimen (45%) and non-ITT placebo (39%), however no significant differences were noted when comparing specific HLTs.Infections of specific interest with vedolizumab use include clostridium difficile, candida, and herpes infections.

This has the potential to affect the results, as corticosteroid only failures may have less serious disease. In addition, the applicant includes patients with intolerance to TNFα (including but not limited to infusion-related reaction, demyelination, congestive heart failure, infection) as TNF failures, however, this reviewer questions some of the criteria included under intolerance and believes it may be more appropriate to consider only those patients who failed to respond or lost response after treatment in this subgroup, as the criteria for intolerance are more ambiguous.

The schedule of events and study procedures for the Maintenance Phase are included in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> below.    In addition, at any unscheduled visits for exacerbation of UC, the following study procedures were to be performed:  physical examination, vital signs, diary review, review of concomitant medications and procedures, partial Mayo score, assessment of AEs and SAEs, clinical chemistry, hematology, PK assessment, and HAHA assessment.</p><p>Reviewer comments: The schedule of events/assessments was appropriate. Patients who discontinued early from the study for any reason completed an Early Termination visit, Week 66 Final Safety visit, and 2-year follow-up survey.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>UC Comparative Safety</head><p>Patient C13006-28011-602 was a 32 year-old white male patient from Italy who was enrolled in Cohort 2 and received a single infusion of vedolizumab during Induction before withdrawing from the trial. One hundred ten days after his single dose of vedolizumab, he underwent a total colectomy with ileal pouch anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. The patient developed peritonitis requiring a second surgery and subsequently experienced respiratory failure and sepsis. He died from cardiac arrest related to sepsis and multiple organ failure.</p><p>Patient C13006-53003-601 was a 32 year-old white male from Switzerland who received blinded vedolizumab during the Induction Phase and achieved clinical response. He was randomized to vedolizumab Q8W during the Maintenance Phase and received 9 additional infusions (5 vedolizumab and 4 placebo) before discontinuing from the trial due to a lack of efficacy. Seventy-one days after his final infusion, biopsies of the descending colon revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, and the patient underwent total colectomy and subsequent chemotherapy to treat multiple metastases. The patient died 552 days after his final dose of vedolizumab.</p><p>FDA Reviewer Comments: When comparing the risk of death in placebo controlled trials, the risk appears to be similar in vedolizumab exposed patients and unexposed patients; however, as previously stated, given the low event rate, any interpretation of these comparisons should be viewed with caution. None of the deaths in UC patients were assessed to be related to study drug, as determined by study investigators and confirmed by the FDA reviewer. In C13007, 2 deaths were assessed as possibly related to study drug by the investigator. Both of these deaths were the result of exacerbation of CD and sepsis/infection. The FDA reviewer believes these CD exacerbations were not likely related to study drug, rather exacerbations due to lack of drug effect in these patients, and therefore would not categorize them as related to study drug. One additional death in a CD patient participating in C13008 was assessed as possibly related to study drug. This was a case of hepatocellular carcinoma occurring approximately 3 years after initiation of vedolizumab. The FDA reviewer believes it is not plausible this death was related to study drug, given the mechanism of action for vedolizumab. Given the low incidence rate, it is difficult to comment further on any potential relationship. Adverse events, including SAEs and deaths, should continue to be collected and assessed in the postmarketing setting. In Study C13006, 2 patients from the non-ITT placebo group and 3 patients from the combined vedolizumab group had clinically significant ECG abnormalities over the course of the study. The ECG abnormalities included sinus tachycardia with PVCs, sinus rhythm with PACs, LVH secondary to hypertension, ventricular ectopic beat, and atrial fibrillation. No patients discontinued prematurely from Study C13006 due to ECG abnormalities. An additional 5 patients had clinically significant ECG findings during the long-term safety study, C13008. Two UC patients and 3 CD patients had abnormal ECG findings, four of which were assessed by the study investigator as not related to study drug. One ECG finding of coronary sinus rhythm, incomplete right bundle branch block in a 20-year-old patient with CD was reported as mild and related to vedolizumab. A repeat ECG 1 month later was within normal limits.</p><p>Reviewer Comments: There does not appear to be an increase in ECG abnormalities in vedolizumab treated patients.</p></div>

One hypothesis on the etiology for the increased risk of PML with natalizumab is that it prevents the ingress of leukocytes into the CNS. Vedolizumab did not affect CD4+ counts, CD8+ counts, or the CD4+:CD8+ lymphocyte ratio in the CSF of the subjects studied. The applicant suggests that this supports that vedolizumab is unlikely to lead to impairment of the CNS immune system and potentially increased PML risk.</p><p>No special safety studies were performed in the vedolizumab clinical development program.

Vedolizumab was not found to modulate cytokine production in in vitro and clinical studies.</p><p>No adverse events were observed that were assessed as related to drug-drug interactions. Reviewer comment: The applicants waiver and deferral request appear appropriate to this reviewer. We generally have waived requirements for pediatric studies of UC treatments in children under the age of 5 years due to the low UC incidence in that age group; however, inclusion of patients as young as of age in your pediatric plan is acceptable.

Discussion focused on PML risk minimization and safety monitoring. Specific agreements included:</p><p> FDA emphasized the need for 2 years of follow-up in the post exposure period, even in patients who drop out of the study or are lost to follow up. Millenium agreed to call subjects by phone every six months until 2 years after treatment discontinuation.  A risk minimization plan, including education of site personnel and patients, follow-up of patients, and retrospective analysis of patient sera for JC virus, is necessary for all future studies, including Phase 1 bridging studies.  A detailed Phase 3 plan and protocols, including specific safety monitoring plans for PML, should be submitted as a complete response, for consideration in removing the clinical hold. The final decision will be based on a review of the submission addressing the clinical hold issues.  The sponsor was also requested to provide a retrospective analysis of all neurological adverse events to date with the drug product  The Agency stated that patients should not receive concomitant immunosuppressants while being treated in the study, and patients should be tapered off of corticosteroids within six months of starting study treatment.  The appropriate patient population to enroll is those who have failed or cannot tolerate immunosuppressive therapy and at least one TNF blocker.  Patients who have a positive JC virus DNA test on screening should be excluded from the study  Agency agreed that routine screening and monitoring MRIs would not be required on all patients, provided patients have a screening baseline neurologic exam with exclusion of those with abnormal findings.

They felt that there are safer, effective drugs to use as first line agents and that this drug should be considered as a second to third line agent. They also felt that the efficacy of the drug is not proven and that the toxicity of the drug is not fully understood, thus the protocol should not be altered.</p><p>The panel members who voted "yes" expressed that prior use of these drugs increased risks for PML and did not understand the rationale for allowing only patients with prior use of these drugs to enroll. One committee member abstained from voting because she felt that there is not enough clinical context to a make a decision and more data are needed.</p><p> On-study Restrictions: In the current US protocols, concomitant immunosuppressants are prohibited beyond the induction phase of vedolizumab treatment. Do the available nonclinical and clinical data support making these restrictions less stringent (i.e., allow concomitant immunosuppressants throughout induction and maintenance treatment)? Millennium believed that analysis of the safety database using number of infusions, rather than months of exposure, is inappropriate. FDA agreed to have further discussion on this, as well as Millennium concerns regarding the inclusion of the risk of PML in the label and a risk management program, at the Pre-BLA meeting.  The Agency and Millennium agreed that JC viremia has been demonstrated to be unlikely of use as a predictor of PML risk in patients treated with natalizumab and that it is acceptable to discontinue JC virus measurements in serum in vedolizumab clinical trials.</p><p>July 24-25, 2012: This was a Type C, End of Phase 3 meeting to discuss the clinical development plan to support registration of vedolizumab for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. There were four major goals of the meeting: 1) Review key clinical analyses data from the completed UC and CD phase 3 studies and obtain concurrence that there is substantial evidence of efficacy in patients with either moderately to severely active UC and CD; 2) obtain concurrence on the suitability of measuring patient exposure to VZB in terms of months as opposed to number of infusions; 3) discuss a proposed pharmacovigilance and risk management plan to be implemented post approval; 4) discuss the proposed data format for the BLA clinical and nonclinical datasets. Major discussion points related to the UC development plan included:  The Agency could not agree that the treatment effect from the Phase 3 Induction Study C13006 meets the criteria for substantial evidence of efficacy based on a single adequate and well-controlled trial and stated this is a review issue. The requirements for demonstration of efficacy from a single study include: statistically very persuasive findings, an effect size that is clinically relevant and meaningful, results that are internally consistent across multiple endpoints, centers, subgroups, and countries. 154  A single adequate and well-controlled maintenance study could be sufficient to extend a claim to maintenance in a population, if there is substantial evidence of efficacy for induction in that population.  The Agency noted that patients from two different cohorts enter into the maintenance study and requested that Millennium provide a separate analysis for each of the cohorts for the primary and secondary endpoints of the maintenance study  A risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) may be necessary to ensure that the benefits of vedolizumab outweigh the risks. The Agency encouraged Millennium to submit proposed REMS with their application.  The safety database was discussed further, with the Agency reiterating previous comments on the needed size of the safety database. In addition, the Agency stated that if Millenium's safety database at the time of BLA filing is less than 1000 patients exposed to ≥ 24 infusions (with a substantial proportion of these patients exposed to ≥ 36 infusions), it would be acceptable for additional data to be submitted as part of the Day 120 Safety Update Report (with a reasonable data cutoff date) to count towards the requirement of an adequate safety database at the time of BLA filing.  In addition, the Division stated that they are currently re-evaluating endpoint definitions in UC and re-evaluating the requirements to support labeling claims for "mucosal healing" in UC ( i.e., definitions, standardized endoscopy methodology, use of histology, etc).  The sponsor indicated that clinical remission in Study C13006 is defined as total Mayo score of ≤ 2 and no individual sub score &gt; 1. Additional analyses were requested using the following alternate definition of clinical remission: total Mayo score of ≤ 2 and no individual subscore &gt; 1 where the Rectal Bleeding subscore must equal 0 and the Endoscopy subscore must equal 0.  The Agency requested that exposure data be provided using both number of infusions and number of months and by categories of prior and concomitant immunosuppressant use.</p><p>November 6, 2012: The purpose of this Type B, Pre-BLA meeting was to discuss the content and format of a complete BLA for vedolizumab for the treatment of patients with moderately to severely active UC or CD, who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to 1 or more conventional therapies, including TNFα  FDA stated that due to the new requirements under PDUFA V for applications under the "Program", the safety database at the time of original BLA submission must include data on at least 900 patients that received ≥ 24 infusions (with a minimum of 4 weeks of follow-up after the last infusion). These data cannot be provided in the 120-Day Safety Update report.  The Agency agreed that a single ISS in the BLA to support the indications of UC and CD is appropriate, but that the safety analyses must also be presented by individual indication. Similarly, submission of a single Section 2.7.4 Summary of </p></div>
