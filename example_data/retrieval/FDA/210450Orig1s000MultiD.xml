<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Executive Summary</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Product Introduction</head><p>AbbVie, Inc. has submitted this New Drug Application (NDA) under section 505(b)(1) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for elagolix sodium (hereafter referred to as elagolix, proprietary name Orilissa) for the management of endometriosis with associated pain. Elagolix, a new molecular entity, is a nonpeptide, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist that reduces pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins (leutinizing hormone (LH) and folliclestimulating hormone (FSH)) resulting in dose-dependent decreases in ovarian production of estradiol and progesterone. If approved, elagolix will be the only marketed oral treatment and the first GnRH receptor antagonist indicated for endometriosis. Unlike GnRH agonists, which cause an initial stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG axis) and a surge in estrogen levels, GnRH antagonists reduce sex hormones without an initial surge.</p><p>The immediate-release tablets contain 150 mg or 200 mg of elagolix. The proposed dosing regimen is either 150 mg once daily or 200 mg twice daily. Each dosage strength is presented in cartons for monthly supply with each carton containing 4-weekly blister packs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Conclusions on the Substantial Evidence of Effectiveness</head><p>The Applicant conducted two adequate and well-controlled trials. The design of these trials and their results meet the statutory requirement for establishing substantial evidence of effectiveness. In both trials, 3 months of treatment with elagolix 150 mg once daily and 200 mg twice daily significantly reduced dysmenorrhea and non-menstrual pelvic pain (co-primary efficacy endpoints) compared to placebo in women with endometriosis-associated pain. Based on secondary endpoints controlled for type I error, both treatment regimens also reduced dysmenorrhea and non-menstrual pelvic pain compared to placebo with 6 months of treatment, and the 200 mg twice daily regimen reduced dyspareunia compared to placebo with 3 months of treatment. Results were similar across both trials without inconsistencies in the data.</p><p>NDA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 210450} {Orilissa and elagolix sodium} 1 9</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Benefit-Risk Assessment</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit-Risk Summary and Assessment</head><p>Endometriosis refers to endometrial tissue outside of the uterus. The hallmark symptoms are chronic pain and infertility. The pain may occur with menses (dysmenorrhea), between menses (non-menstrual pelvic pain) or with sexual intercourse (dyspareunia). Because estrogen promotes the growth of endometriosis tissue and contributes to local inflammation and pain, most medical therapies for endometriosis reduce estrogen concentrations. Treatment options include gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, subcutaneously administered medroxyprogesterone acetate, and surgery. There are currently no marketed oral treatments for endometriosis. A safe and effective oral therapy would provide another treatment option for endometriosis.</p><p>Orilissa (elagolix), a GnRH antagonist, is an oral treatment for moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis. The proposed dose is 150 mg once daily or 200 mg twice daily.</p><p>The Applicant evaluated the efficacy of Orilissa in two Phase 3 trials (Studies 665 and 671) that randomized a total of 1686 premenopausal women with moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis to Orilissa (475 received 150 mg once daily and 477 received 200 mg twice daily) or placebo.</p><p>The co-primary efficacy endpoints in both trials assessed the proportion of subjects whose dysmenorrhea responded to treatment at Month 3 and the proportion of subjects whose non-menstrual pelvic pain responded to treatment at Month 3. In both trials, the 150 mg once daily dose and 200 mg twice daily dose were superior to placebo on both co-primary endpoints. For example, in Study 665, the proportion of responders for dysmenorrhea at Month 3 was 46% with Orilissa 150 mg once daily, 76% with Orilissa 200 mg twice daily and 20% with placebo (p ≤ 0.001 for each comparison to placebo). In this trial, the proportion of responders for non-menstrual pelvic pain at Month 3 was 50% with Orilissa 150 mg once daily, 55% with Orilissa 200 mg twice daily and 36% with placebo (p ≤ 0.001 for each comparison to placebo). The results for the other Phase 3 trial were similar.</p><p>Both trials included several secondary efficacy endpoints that were controlled for type 1 error. Results for these endpoints showed that, compared to placebo, both Orilissa doses in both trials reduced dysmenorrhea and non-menstrual pelvic pain at Month 6 and that only the 200 mg twice daily dose reduced dyspareunia at Month 3. In both trials, there was a statistically significant reduction in opioid use at Month 6 for the 200 mg twice daily dose only, but the Applicant did not show that the mean reduction in opioid pill NDA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 210450} {Orilissa and elagolix sodium} 2 0 counts of 0.12 is clinically meaningful.</p><p>The highly consistent results from these two adequate and well-controlled trials clearly establish the efficacy of both the 150 mg once daily and 200 mg twice daily regimens for the treatment of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis.</p><p>The endometriosis safety database includes 2966 subjects who received at least one dose of Orilissa, 1283 of whom received Orilissa for at least 6 months and 425 of whom received Orilissa for at least 12 months. A total of 279 women received the maximum recommended dose of 200 mg twice daily for 12 months.</p><p>The most important safety concerns are bone loss and depression-related adverse reactions.</p><p>Orilissa causes a dose-and duration-dependent decline in bone mineral density <ref type="bibr">(BMD)</ref>. Compared to placebo, the mean change in lumbar spine BMD was about 1% after 6 months with 150 mg once daily and approximately 3% after 6 months with elagolix 200 mg twice daily. Partial recovery was seen in subjects who received Orilissa for up to 12 months and who were followed for 12 months after stopping treatment. The impact of these BMD declines on long-term bone health and future fracture risk is unknown. The concerns with bone loss will be mitigated with labeling (Warning and medication guide) that includes a contraindication for women with known osteoporosis, a recommendation to assess BMD in women with additional risk factors for bone loss, and a limitation on duration of use. Because the bone loss did not plateau, the maximum recommended duration of use will be 24 months for the 150 mg once daily dose and 6 months for the 200 mg twice daily dose. Although endometriosis is chronic, treatment for 6 to 24 months can be useful for some women who are close to menopause (endometriosis improves during menopause) and for those who wish to delay surgical therapy.</p><p>Compared to placebo, Orilissa-treated subjects in the Phase 3 trials had a higher incidence of depression-related adverse reactions (2.7% with 150 mg once daily, 6.1% with 200 mg twice daily, and 2.3% with placebo). In addition, suicidal ideation and behavior, including one completed suicide, occurred in Orilissa-treated subjects. These risks will also be mitigated with labeling (Warning and medication guide), recommending immediate medical attention for suicidal ideation and behavior, prompt evaluation if depressive symptoms occur and for the prescriber to determine whether the risk of continuing treatment in these patients outweighs the benefits.</p><p>Other safety concerns include the potential for early pregnancy loss (Orilissa will be contraindicated in pregnant women, pregnancy is to be excluded before treatment, and women are to use contraception), increased systemic exposures to elagolix (the active ingredient in Orilissa) in women with moderate or severe hepatic impairment and in the setting of certain drug-drug interactions, a dose-dependent elevation in serum alanine aminotransferase to at least three times the upper limit of the reference range without evidence of severe drug-NDA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 210450} {Orilissa and elagolix sodium} <ref type="bibr">2 6</ref> 2. Therapeutic Context</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Analysis of Condition</head><p>Endometriosis is a chronic condition characterized by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside of the uterus that affects approximately 11% of women of reproductive age. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The condition is variable in its extent and symptoms. Significant pelvic anatomic disruption can be relatively asymptomatic for some women while a small focus can result in moderate to severe chronic pain for others. Endometriosis-related pain can be disabling, adversely impacting daily activities, sexual activity, partner relationship, and mental health. The symptoms of endometriosis consist of dysmenorrhea (DYS), nonmenstrual pelvic pain (NMPP), dyspareunia (DYSP), and infertility. Other symptoms may arise if endometriosis affects the gastrointestinal and urologic systems. Distant migration of endometriotic implants to the lung, giving rise to respiratory systems, has also been reported. Rare cases of ovarian and peritoneal carcinoma have developed in foci of endometriotic tissue.</p><p>Multifactorial etiologies have been proposed as causes for endometriosis. These include retrograde menstruation, transformation of peritoneal cells, vascular transport of endometrial cells, and immune disorders.</p><p>Risk factors include nulliparity, delayed menarche, high estrogen levels, family history, and uterine anomalies that prevent normal passage of menstrual flow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Analysis of Current Treatment Options</head><p>The primary treatment objective in women with endometriosis is the management of pain, using both pharmacologic and surgical approaches. In addition to FDA-approved therapies for endometriosis (listed below), off-label therapies, used in decreasing frequency, include combined oral contraceptives, high-dose progestins, and aromatase inhibitors. Combined oral contraceptives are often prescribed with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), both of which are approved for the treatment of dysmenorrhea as first-line therapy. Opioid analgesics are reserved as a second-line treatment.</p><p>Surgical management includes laparoscopic excision, fulgeration, and laser ablation of endometriosis lesions, drainage or resection of endometriomas, resection of rectovaginal nodules, lysis of adhesions, interruption of nerve pathways (e.g., laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation or presacral neurectomy), and hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy. Conservative surgical therapy may be used as a first-line option or following failed medical NDA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 210450} {Orilissa and elagolix sodium} <ref type="bibr">2 7</ref> therapy. However, recurrence of symptoms within 6 to 12 months is common following conservative surgery. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">2</ref> Presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> are drug products approved for the management of endometriosis, by chronological order of approval.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Regulatory Background</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">U.S. Regulatory Actions and Marketing History</head><p>Elagolix is a new molecular entity that is being developed for the treatment of pain with endometriosis (IND 064802) and heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids In this submission, elagolix, as monotherapy, is evaluated for its effect on dysmenorrhea (DYS) and nonmenstrual pelvic pain (NMPP) in women with endometriosisassociated pain (EAP). Because the use of elagolix alone is limited by the adverse effect of estradiol suppression on bone mineral density, add-back therapy for EAP, consisting of elagolix with estradiol and norethindrone acetate, is currently being developed under .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Summary of Presubmission/Submission Regulatory Activity</head><p>The clinical development of elagolix has been conducted under IND 064802, which was opened on July 21, 2013. AbbVie, Inc. (formerly Abbott Laboratories) in-licensed the compound from Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (NBI) in June 2010.</p><p>In an <ref type="bibr">October 6, 2006</ref>, guidance meeting, the Division recommended that diagnosis of endometriosis be based on laparoscopic confirmation, preferably by pathology from tissue biopsy, within 60 months of treatment in Phase 3 studies. The Division also recommended daily pain assessment using a modified Biberoglu and Behrman (B&amp;B) scale instead of a Visual Analog Scale, in accordance with the leuprolide and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate clinical programs.</p><p>In the March 28, 2011, End-of-Phase 2 meeting, the Division conveyed the following:  General agreement with the proposal to demonstrate efficacy support with two randomized, placebo-controlled, 6-month efficacy trials in adult premenopausal women (aged 18 to 49 years) who have laparoscopy-confirmed endometriosis and moderate to severe endometriosis-associated pain.  Agreement with the proposed co-primary endpoints: the proportion of responders at in pain scores assessed by the daily modified pain scale for dysmenorrhea (DYS) and non-menstrual pelvic pain (NMPP). Elagolix will need to demonstrate a statistically significantly (2-sided alpha of 0.05) greater proportion of responders for both dysmenorrhea and NMPP for a study to be considered successful.  Agreement with the use of a responder analysis, such as the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale. However, the definition of a responder should be based on the magnitude of reduction in pain that is clinically meaningful to women being treated. The Division prefers a cut point in the PGIC between those who report "moderately or very improved" compared to those who report "minimally improved or worse."  The responder definition for benefit should also be determined during the study, through an appropriate anchor question derived from treatment and receiver operator characteristics (ROC) methodology. Therefore, criteria should be proposed for determining that the responder rate difference is both clinically and statistically significant for the study to be declared successful.  Agreement with the plans to conduct the ROC analysis on data pooled from both efficacy studies, then to calculate the response criterion individually for dysmenorrhea and for NMPP.  With respect to evaluating bone mineral density (BMD), the Division noted that:</p><p>o DXA results at the spine and hip are of equal interest. Hip BMD is of concern due to the potential risk of hip fracture. o Interpretation of changes at one year of treatment may be difficult in the absence of a placebo control arm, particularly since younger subjects, who have not attained peak bone mass, would be expected to have a positive change in BMD over time. o Persistent decrements in BMD at the month 12 post-treatment follow-up evaluation and BMD loss that did not show resolution after a year off treatment would be of concern.</p><p>In a September 23, 2011, guidance meeting, the Division noted the following:  Agreement with evaluation of efficacy at 3 months to minimize the impact for possible unblinding and disproportionate early discontinuation in the placebo arm. However, persistence of efficacy at 6 months would also be required for approval.     The Division would be receptive to labeling claims including secondary endpoints of dyspareunia if they were properly accounted for in the statistical analysis plan and the overall type 1 error is preserved.  The Division requested that at least 50% of Phase 3 subjects be enrolled at study sites in the U.S. or Canada.</p><p>A Phase 3 protocol (Study M12-665) was submitted on February 2, 2012, for Special Protocol Assessment. In a non-agreement letter dated March 19, 2012, the Division disagreed with numerous aspects of the protocol</p><p>In an April 24, 2012 Type A meeting to discuss the Special Protocol Assessment review, the Division agreed with the proposed plan to limit rescue analgesics to two medications-naproxen 500 mg and hydrocodone 5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg (or global equivalents in countries where these two medications are not available). In collaboration with the Division of Anesthesia, Analgesia, and Addiction Products (DAAAP), the Division noted that, subjects identified as responders based on the ROC analysis of pain scores should be reclassified as nonresponders if they had a 15% or greater increase in average daily dose of rescue analgesic. The Division further requested an additional secondary analysis to evaluate the proportion of subjects in each treatment arm who experience improvement in pain ranging from 0 to 100%, as a cumulative distribution. The Applicant opted to reach agreement with the Division through "informal discussions" rather than submitting a revised protocol for a second Special Protocol Assessment review.</p><p>In a May 23, 2013 advice letter, the Division agreed with extending the laparoscopic diagnosis interval to 10 years (from years) for the trial eligibility criteria. The Division continued to disagree</p><p>In preliminary responses dated <ref type="bibr">March 6, 2014</ref>, in response to a guidance meeting request (which the Applicant canceled prior to the meeting), the Division explicitly disagreed with the proposal The Division also disagreed PGIC is not considered a well-defined and reliable measure of endometriosis-associated pain. The Division encouraged evaluating dyspareunia as a key secondary endpoint that could support a labeling claim, by moving dyspareunia higher in the list of ranked secondary endpoints.</p><p>In preliminary responses dated December 5, 2016, in response to a pre-NDA meeting request (which the Applicant canceled prior to the meeting), Division generally agreed with the proposed format and content of the planned NDA submission.</p><p>In a January 4, 2017 advice letter, the Division recommend that, for both Phase 3 trials (Studies 665 and 671), the Applicant provide additional analyses. Specifically, the Applicant was recommended to use all modified intent-to-treat (mlTT) subjects, pooled across all study arms and irrespective of treatment assignment. With these data, the Applicant should produce the empirical cumulative distribution functions (CDF) for the changes from baseline to month 3 in the dysmenorrhea (DYS) score and the non-menstrual pelvic pain (NMPP) score, using the PGIC as an anchor for both.</p><p>The NDA was submitted on August 23, 2017, with a request for Priority Review because elagolix will treat a serious condition (endometriosis with associated pain) and provide a significant improvement in safety compared to available therapies, such as opioids.</p><p>On October 13, 2017, the Division notified the Applicant that the review of this application was classified as Priority, with a user fee goal date of April 23, 2018.</p><p>In January 2018, the Division sought information regarding a liver case that was close to meeting the criteria for Hy's law case and requested detailed, hepatic safety analyses on data from all Phase 2 and 3 trials (including the ongoing trials for the uterine fibroid indication). The Applicant's extensive response, submitted on March 19, 2018, was deemed a major amendment to the application. On March 26, 2018, the Division informed the Applicant that the goal date would be extended by 3 months to July 23, 2018.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Office of Scientific Investigations</head><p>The Office of Scientific Investigations (OSI) was consulted for this NDA. Five clinical sites participating in the two 6-month efficacy trials and the two extension trials were inspected.</p><p>Site 45069, Alvadore Osborn, DO, West Des Moines, Iowa, was selected due to involvement in all four studies, a moderate treatment effect, and low rate of protocol violations. The inspection did not identify any objectionable conditions or practices that would justify enforcement action. On May 15, 2018, this site was classified as no deviation from regulation (NAI).</p><p>Site 51673, Krzysztof Wilk, MD, PhD, Katowice, Poland, was selected due to the highest risk rank score identified by the Site Selection Tool, treatment effect, and low rates of discontinuations and protocol violations. The inspector noted no evidence of underreporting of adverse events, but issued a Form 483, FDA Establishment Inspection Report, noting that an ineligible subject (having only mild endometriosis pain) was enrolled and treated with the study drug. After reviewing Dr. Wilk's response to the inspectional finding, OSI made a preliminary determination on March 1, 2018 that the subject likely did not have an impact on the study's safety or efficacy results.</p><p>Site 53501, Shivkamini Somasundaram, MD, Columbus, Ohio, was selected due to high enrollment in Study M12-671 and an overall second highest risk rank per the Site Selection Tool. The inspection did not identify any objectionable conditions or practices that would justify enforcement action. On April 26, 2018, this site was classified as NAI.</p><p>Site 17011, James Simon, MD, Washington, DC, was selected due to high enrollment in Study M12-671 and an overall third highest risk rank score per the Site Selection Tool. A Form 483, FDA Establishment Inspection Report, was issued because of failure to conduct the investigation in accordance with the investigator's signed statement and investigational plan concerning one subject. After reviewing all pertinent records and Dr. Simon's response to the Inspectional Observation, OSI determined that the study had been conducted adequately and NDA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 210450} {Orilissa and elagolix sodium} <ref type="formula">3 6</ref> the data generated by this site could be used in support of the indication. Per a memorandum dated April 20, 2018, this site was classified as Deviation(s) from regulations (VAI).</p><p>Site 52473, David Young, MD, Pleasant Grove, Utah, was selected due to a large treatment effect in Study M12-665. A Form 483, FDA Establishment Inspection Report, was issued, citing several protocol violations, including enrolling a subject who was ineligible per protocol and recording the intake of prohibited medication by the wrong subject. After reviewing all pertinent records and Dr. Young's response to the inspection findings, OSI determined that the study had been conducted adequately and the data generated by this site could be used in support of the indication. Per a memorandum dated May 18, 2018, this site was classified as VAI.</p><p>Despite the regulatory violations noted at Drs. Simon's, Wilk's, and Young's sites, OSI concluded in a March 1, 2018 summary memorandum that the findings at these three sites were unlikely to significantly impact data reliability.</p></div>

Elagolix binds reversibly with high affinity to the human GnRH receptor (K d = 54pM) and inhibits GnRH action in vitro in functional assays with K i values in the low nM range (1.5, 2.8nM). The rank order of binding across species is: human &gt; monkey ~ rabbit &gt;&gt;&gt; rat. There were no binding studies conducted against the dog GnRH receptor. Functional assays demonstrated activity at the rabbit, monkey, and human GnRH receptors.</p><p>Efficacy of elagolix was not assessed in nonclinical species for several reasons:</p><p>(1) there are no animal models of endometriosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(2)</ref> binding of elagolix to the GnRH receptor in nonclinical species was weak (rat, rabbit) or not characterized (dog, mouse) (3) sufficient exposure could not be achieved with repeat dosing (monkey)</p><p>Receptor-mediated pharmacological effects were largely absent in nonclinical species. These included (when they were measured) reductions in LH, FSH, estrogen or testosterone, or changes in reproductive organs that would be expected from prolonged reductions in sex steroids. BMD was not measured in any nonclinical species. Toxicity that might result from prolonged reduction of sex steroids could not be reliably assessed in nonclinical studies due to low affinity of elagolix at the GnRH receptor in the nonclinical species. However, the pivotal nonclinical studies are deemed sufficient to evaluate non-receptor-mediated or off-target effects of elagolix.</p><p>There were no findings in a screen of 100 receptors for off-target binding of elagolix.</p><p>Safety pharmacology studies were conducted in rats and monkeys at adequate multiples of exposure (&gt; 20) and were negative. In agreement with nonclinical findings, a clinical thorough QT study was negative for arrhythmia risk.</p><p>Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion (ADME): The pharmacokinetics of elagolix were determined in CD-1 mice, Sprague Dawley rats, Beagle dogs and cynomolgus monkeys. In vivo absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) studies were conducted in rats and dogs with radiolabeled compound and compared to absorption, metabolism, and excretion studies conducted with [ 14 C]elagolix in humans.</p><p>The pharmacokinetic profile of elagolix was generally characterized by rapid absorption, high plasma clearance, moderate volumes of distribution and a short elimination half-life in mouse, dog, and monkey. Bioavailability ranged from ~10% (mouse and monkey) to 100% (dog). Humans and rats had similar bioavailability (~50%). Protein binding ranged from 78 to 90% across species.</p><p>Distribution after oral dosing was primarily to the gastrointestinal tract. Elagolix did not cross the blood brain barrier, did not accumulate in pigmented tissue, and did not partition into red blood cells. It did, however; freely cross the placenta (assessed in the rat).</p><p>Elagolix is not extensively metabolized, circulating primarily as unchanged drug in plasma and remaining largely intact through clearance. Metabolic pathways were similar across species NDA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 210450} {Orilissa and elagolix sodium} 4 0 including humans. There were no major metabolites in any species (although M14 and M15 were borderline major in the rat), and no unique human metabolites. There were six active metabolites. The two most significant were the O-demethyl metabolite (M3, code name NBI 61962), and N-dealkyl metabolite (M6x, code name NBI 54048). M3 has a binding affinity comparable to elagolix, and M6x has a 6-fold higher affinity. These metabolites were monitored throughout the nonclinical development program and were verified to remain below 10% of parent across species.</p><p>Clearance of elagolix was primarily via the fecal route. Excretion into milk was not determined.</p><p>In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated the following potentially clinically relevant interactions of elagolix with metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters: elagolix is a substrate for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and organic-anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1. Elagolix is also a weak to moderate inducer of CYP3A and CYP2B6, and an inhibitor of P-gp and OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.</p><p>In vitro metabolism studies were conducted with the two active metabolites, M3 (O-demethyl metabolite) and M6x (N-dealkyl metabolite). The most significant potential effect was inhibition of CYP3A4/5, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 by M6x. However, concentrations of this metabolite would have to reach micromolar levels for inhibition to become significant, which is not clinically relevant.</p><p>Toxicokinetics of elagolix were similar in mice, rats, dogs, and humans. Exposure was proportional or somewhat greater than proportional to dose, there were no strong gender differences, and there was no evidence of accumulation. Toxicokinetics were strikingly different in rabbit and monkey. In the rabbit, repeat dosing in the dose range of &lt; 300 mg/kg led to dramatic increases in exposure that were not associated with accumulation. In the monkey, repeat dosing led to a dramatic reduction in exposure that was unexplained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Toxicology:</head><p>Single and repeat-dose toxicology studies were conducted in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, and monkeys. The Sprague Dawley rat and Beagle dog were chosen for the pivotal repeat-dose toxicology studies based on the ability to achieve higher systemic exposures when compared to mice and monkeys. However, as was previously discussed, affinity of elagolix for the rat GnRH receptor was poor (~1000-fold less compared to humans), and receptor affinity in the dog was not measured.</p><p>In the rat, elagolix would have to reach free concentrations in the range of 12µM (C max = 7740 ng/mL) to fully inhibit the GnRH receptor. The highest plasma concentration (C max ) seen in the rat was at a single dose of 2000 mg/kg (~60µM or ~6µM free). For that reason, the toxicities seen in the rat pivotal studies should generally be interpreted as being non-receptor-mediated. The toxicities seen in the dog pivotal studies should also be interpreted as possibly being nonreceptor mediated, since few or no pharmacodynamic effects were observed even at high doses.</p><p>NDA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 210450} {Orilissa and elagolix sodium} 4 1</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Single dose studies:</head><p>Single dose toxicity studies were conducted in rats and monkeys at the same doses: 300, 600, 1200, or 2000 mg/kg with ~4-fold higher exposures achieved in the monkey than the rat per unit dose. The dose at which no adverse effects were observed (no observed adverse effect level or NOAEL) was 300 mg/kg for both species, but maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) diverged, being set at the low dose for the monkey and the high dose for the rat.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeat-dose studies:</head><p>A significant feature of the repeat-dose studies that complicated interpretation of the results was mortality that was apparently related to the drug formulation and not the toxicity of elagolix itself. In the rat 2-week study, there was ~50% mortality at the high dose (1200 mg/kg/d) that was attributed to gavage error or aspiration of the dose that resulted in ulcerative tracheitis/bronchitis. The subsequent repeat-dose studies <ref type="bibr">(6-, 13-, and 26-week)</ref> reduced the high dose to 600 mg/kg/d but still had significant dose-related mortality (sometimes &gt; 50% at the high dose). The main clinical sign was respiratory distress with confirmatory histological findings in the trachea and bronchi.</p><p>In the dog, mortality associated with dosing error/aspiration of test article was observed in both the 6-week (high dose 300 mg/kg/d) and 26-week (high dose 150 mg/kg/d) studies, and led the sponsor to reformulate the drug as a capsule for the 9-month study. In that study, a high dose of 150 mg/kg/d was administered without mortality.</p><p>Putting aside the mortality in the repeat-dose studies that was likely due to aspiration leading to respiratory toxicity, the overall toxicity profile of elagolix is fairly benign and is summarized below by species.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RAT:</head><p>In the rat, the highest oral dose administered in the 6-, 13-, and 26-week studies was 600 mg/kg/d. The NOAEL decreased with increasing duration in each study, from 600 to 300 to 100 mg/kg/d; exposures corresponded to 19, 11, and 2-fold the MRHD, respectively.</p><p>There were no new toxicities in the 26-week studies that had not appeared in the shorter duration studies, but not all toxicities were consistently present. Liver toxicity, which manifested in the 13-week study as increased liver weight (up to 45%), mild hepatocellular hypertrophy, and elevated enzymes (&lt; 3-fold) at the high dose, were not reported in the 26week study. Inconsistent changes in adrenal weights in the shorter duration studies were not seen in the 26-week studies. Elevations in platelets and reticulocytes observed in shorter duration studies were also not observed in the 26-week study.</p><p>Estradiol and testosterone levels were assessed in the 6-week study and, unsurprisingly, were found to be highly variable. For that reason, the sponsor did not attempt to draw any conclusions about the effect of elagolix on sex hormone levels in the rat. Studies by the dietary route were conducted at 6, 15, and 28-week durations. These studies were conducted to qualify impurities, determine dose-ranging for carcinogenicity studies, and bridge from the liquid formulation. The highest dose administered in these studies was 800 mg/kg/d. As expected, exposures by the dietary route were less than by oral gavage for a given dose. However, maximum exposures still reached ~9-fold the human MRHD.</p><p>A unique adverse finding in the 28-week dietary study was reported: focal degeneration/necrosis localized to the limiting ridge of the glandular stomach at both test doses (600 and 800 mg/kg/d). Erosion, inflammation, ulceration, and hyperplasia were noted, and the applicant suggested that this finding might explain the minimally lower hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct), and mildly elevated white blood cell counts. In the 2-year carcinogenicity study (top dose 800 mg/kg/d), dose-dependent erosion and hyperkeratosis were noted in the stomach. The limiting ridge is a structure unique to the rat, and microscopic findings in the stomach were not noted in other species. Relevance to humans is therefore low.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DOG:</head><p>In the dog, the highest dose administered in the 6-and 26-week studies by gavage was 300 mg/kg/d, and the NOAELs were similar: 50 and 75 mg/kg/d, respectively. Exposures were higher than in the rat per unit dose, and reached an MOE of 23 based on AUC at the higher NOAEL. However, continuing problems with aspiration of the liquid formulation led the applicant to reformulate elagolix as a capsule for the pivotal 9-month study. The NOAEL in the longer duration study was 30 mg/kg/d (MOE = 8).</p><p>The pattern of toxicity in the dog was similar to that in the rat. Body weights were reduced ~20% for both males and females at the high dose. There were reactive changes in the liver that were reflected in elevated alkaline phosphatase (7.5-fold max) and increased organ weight. There were mild reductions in Hb and Hct and slight elevations in white blood cells. Relative spleen weight was reduced, but there were no corresponding histological findings. There was gallbladder irritation at the high dose that recovered.</p><p>The only pharmacodynamic signal in the dog was reduced prostate weight in the 9-month study (up to 56% at the high dose that did not recover). Estradiol and testosterone levels were assessed in the 6-and 26-week studies, and no treatment-related effects were noted. Testosterone values were highly variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MONKEY:</head><p>Use of the monkey as a nonclinical model for the action of elagolix was limited due to unusual toxicokinetics in this species. Repeat-dosing in the monkey led to a very rapid reduction in exposure, the cause of which was not explained by the applicant. Two-, 6-, and 13-week studies were conducted in the monkey using the liquid formulation by oral gavage. The NOAEL for all three studies was the same: 300 mg/kg/d. MOEs were calculated based on exposure at day 1, since exposure fell off by ~50% within 2 weeks of dosing and continued to fall. At the NOAEL, the highest MOE based on AUC was 49. Findings included modestly increased liver and kidney weights that did not have corresponding histology, were reversible, and were considered reactive and not adverse. At the highest dose tested (600 mg/kg/d), the thymus showed involution and atrophy. An electrocardiographic (ECG) study was included in the 13-week study that was negative, but this finding is not useful since it was conducted at the end of the study when exposures were low.</p><p>There was a pharmacodynamic signal of atrophy in the uterus, cervix, and vagina in the 6week study. No effects were noted in sex organs of the males, but the applicant considered the male animals to be sexually immature. Estradiol and testosterone levels were assessed and found to be highly variable. For that reason, the applicant did not attempt to draw any conclusions about the effect of elagolix on sex hormone levels in the monkey.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity:</head><p>Elagolix was not genotoxic by the standard battery of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests. Carcinogenicity was evaluated in 2-year studies in the mouse and rat by the dietary route that achieved exposures of greater than 10-fold the MRHD. Elagolix was not carcinogenic in the mouse. In the rat, liver and thyroid neoplasms were observed that were deemed species specific. The potential for carcinogenic risk in humans is negligible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reproductive toxicity:</head><p>Fertility and early embryonic development was evaluated in the rat at doses of 30, 150, and 300 mg/kg/d. Mortality in this study followed the pattern of the repeat-dose toxicity studies, that is, with signs of aspiration and respiratory distress. Treatment with elagolix had no effect on reproductive parameters (estrous cycle, reproductive performance, sperm count, sperm motility, pregnancy rate, mating behavior) or observations at Cesarean section related to implantation or embryo-fetal viability. However, as discussed above, these negative findings are likely due to the low affinity of elagolix for the rat GnRH receptor.</p><p>The NOAEL for maternal and paternal effects was 50 mg/kg/day. For reproductive performance, fertility, and embryo/fetal viability, no effects (adverse or nonadverse) were observed at any dose, so a NOEL (no observed effect level) was set at ≥ 300 mg/kg/d. With respect to the AUC at the MRHD, the exposure multiple for women based on the AUC at the NOEL of 300 mg/kg/day for the fertility effects in the female rat is ~4.6-fold. However, the applicant calculated that, when adjusted for the difference in affinity of elagolix for the rat and human GnRH receptor, this exposure multiple translates to 0.007-fold, or essentially zero as compared to humans. Thus, this fertility study is not informative for human risk, because the rat reproductive system is insensitive to elagolix.</p><p>Teratogenicity of elagolix was evaluated in the rat and the rabbit. There was a striking difference between the rat and the rabbit in the ability to tolerate dosing, possibly due to the large difference in affinity of elagolix for the rat versus the rabbit GnRH receptor (low versus moderate), and/or possibly due to a striking increase in exposure that occurred in the rabbit NDA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 210450} {Orilissa and elagolix sodium} 4 4 with repeat dosing. In both the rat and rabbit, dose range finding studies were conducted using the liquid formulation by oral gavage to establish the doses for the definitive study. Rats were dosed from gestation day (GD) 6 to GD17 up to 1200 mg/kg/d and rabbits were dosed from GD7 to GD20 up to 600 mg/kg/d. Pregnant rat dams tolerated dosing well but pregnant rabbit dams did not; there was a high rate of mortality and abortion which led to a low and very limited dose range being set for the definitive study.</p><p>In the rat, an embryofetal development (EFD) study was successfully completed using doses of 300, 600, and 1200 mg/kg/d. The NOEL for both maternal toxicity and fetal viability and growth was set at less than or equal to the low dose, based on unscheduled deaths in the dams (likely due to aspiration of the test article) and decreased fetal weight and increased postimplantation loss (likely due to reduced feed consumption and body weight loss in the dams). There were no treatment-related external, visceral, or skeletal findings, so the NOAEL for fetal teratogenicity was set at the high dose. Elagolix was shown in distribution studies to freely cross the placental barrier, so it can be assumed that fetuses were fully exposed to the drug. This study was useful for evaluating teratogenicity of elagolix to the developing fetus that was independent of changes in estrogen or progesterone. Using rat AUC values obtained on GD17 compared to the human AUC at the MRHD of 3.5 ug•hr/mL, at 300 mg/kg/day, the MOE is 6.5 and at 1200 mg/kg/day, the MOE is 39.4.</p><p>In the rabbit, the definitive EFD study was conducted at lower does than in the rat, and was conducted over a very limited dose range (100, 150, and 200 mg/kg/d). Exposures at the high dose in this study were roughly comparable to exposures at the low dose in the rat EFD study. There was significant maternal and fetal toxicity at the high dose, as reflected in mortality, abortion, and reduced fetal weight. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was thus set at the mid dose (MOE = 6.6). One mid-dose and one high-dose dam had litters with no viable fetuses, which resulted in an increase in post-implantation loss at those two doses. Based on these findings plus reduced fetal weight, the NOEL for embryofetal toxicity was the low dose (MOE = 2.7). Fetal external, visceral, and skeletal examinations were negative, indicating no teratogenic effects of elagolix. The NOEL for teratogenicity was set at the high dose (MOE = 11.6).</p><p>Taken together, the results from the rat and rabbit EFD studies are informative for human teratogenic risk. Exposures were achieved that were greater than the exposures expected at the MRHD and because elagolix crosses the placental barrier, fetuses can assume to have been exposed. Elagolix was found negative for teratogenicity in both species.</p><p>However, the EFD studies are less informative for risk of early pregnancy loss in humans. In the rat, hormones necessary for maintenance of pregnancy were likely not affected, so the lack of effect of elagolix on litter viability does not translate to the human. In the rabbit, the species that is more sensitive to the pharmacological action of elagolix, it was concerning that there were single instances of total litter loss at both the mid and high doses. The applicant has recognized that an effect of elagolix on pregnancy maintenance in the human cannot be ruled out, and appropriately contraindicates its use during pregnancy. Lastly, a pre-and post-natal development study was conducted in the rat, using the dietary route of administration. Only two, relatively low doses were assessed: 100 and 300 mg/kg/d. Dams were dosed from GD2 through lactation day 20 (LD20). Steady state plasma concentrations measured in dams on LD21 were roughly 10-fold lower than C max concentrations via oral gavage at the same doses. There were minimal findings. The NOAEL for F1 neonatal/early postnatal toxicity/developmental toxicity was 100 mg/kg/d and the NOAEL for toxicity for F1 post-weaning/reproductive toxicity and F2 neonatal/early postnatal toxicity was 300 mg/kg/d. Because AUC data were not generated, calculation of the safety margins could not be made.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>Elagolix has been thoroughly evaluated in a full set of nonclinical toxicity studies. Based on in vitro and in vivo animal data, the safety profile of elagolix does not raise concerns for administration to women at the proposed doses and durations. Appropriate information to inform pregnancy risk will be included in labeling. From the nonclinical pharmacology/toxicology perspective, elagolix can be approved.

There were no binding studies conducted against the dog GnRH receptor.

Metabolites -binding to the GnRH receptor and functional activity:</p><p>The pharmacological activity of the primary metabolite of elagolix (M3) as well as M6x, and four additional degradants or metabolites was characterized in in vitro binding assays (cloned receptor membrane binding) and in cell-based functional assays (IP 3 production). Of these, only M6x showed significant affinity for the GnRH receptor. M6x, which is present in humans, monkeys, dogs and rats, was found to have a Kd at the human GnRH receptor of 0.009 nM, which is 6-fold higher than elagolix. All the others tested, which included the enantiomer of elagolix, had significantly lower activity than elagolix. None of these metabolites are expected to affect the pharmacodynamics of elagolix since they are either not formed (elagolix enantiomer) or produced at low levels in humans. Levels of M3 and M6x were monitored throughout nonclinical and clinical testing, and were always found to be low. </p></div>

Elagolix is primarily metabolized by Odemethylation, with minor metabolites formed via N-dealkylation, dehydration (lactam formation), glucuronidation, and oxidation. There were no major metabolites in any species, and no unique human metabolites. There was no chiral inversion of elagolix to its enantiomer in vitro, which is consistent with in vivo findings.</p><p>In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated the following potentially clinically relevant interactions of elagolix with metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters: elagolix is a substrate for CYP3A, P-gp and OATP1B1, a weak to moderate inducer of CYP3A and 2B6, and an inhibitor of P-gp and OATP1B1 and 1B3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metabolism</head><p>In vitro metabolism studies were conducted with two active metabolites, M3 (NBI-61692) and M6x (NBI-54048). The most significant potential effect was inhibition of CYP3A4/5, 2C9, and 2C19 by M6x. However, concentrations of this metabolite would have to reach micromolar levels for inhibition to become significant, which is not clinically relevant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Type of Study Major Findings Excretion</head><p>Excretion of elagolix was determined in rats (intact and bile-duct cannulated; M/F), dogs (M/F), and humans (M), using radiolabeled compound. Orally administered elagolix (parent and metabolites) was mainly cleared via biliary excretion and fecal elimination, with minimal renal clearance, in both nonclinical species and humans. No notable sex differences were noted. Excretion into milk was not determined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TK data from general toxicology studies</head><p>Toxicokinetics of elagolix were similar in mice, rats, dogs, and humans. Exposure was proportional or somewhat greater than proportional to dose, there were no strong gender differences, and there was no evidence of accumulation. Toxicokinetics were strikingly different in rabbit and monkey. In the rabbit, repeat dosing in the dose range of &lt; 300 mg/kg led to dramatic increases in exposure that were not associated with accumulation. In the monkey, repeat dosing led to a dramatic reduction in exposure that was unexplained.</p><p>Elagolix was poorly tolerated by all species in the liquid formulation. The formulation was altered to the capsule form for the 9-month dog study, and to the dietary form for the 6-month rat study, and the 2-year mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies.   There was no mortality</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical signs</head><p>Soft/mucoid stools, vomitus, diarrhea that increased in a dose-dependent manner throughout the dosing period. Because control groups had a significant incidence of vomiting, the applicant attributed this to palatability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Body weights and feed consumption</head><p>Mean body weight was decreased throughout the dosing period for both males (19.4%) and females (18.7%) in the high dose group. Decreased mean body weight for the high dose males and females reached toxicological significance (i.e., more than 10% less than controls) by day 8 and remained decreased throughout the remainder of the dosing phase (ending at day 274). No other toxicologically meaningful differences in mean body weight were noted in the remaining dose groups. Body weight gains rebounded in the recovery animals.</p><p>Statistically significant decreases in mean food consumption (21.4% to 68.0%) were noted for weeks 1 to 4 and week 10 for high dose males and (26.7% to 30.7%) for weeks 1 and 2 for the females administered 150 mg/kg/day. No other significant test article-related differences in mean food consumption were noted during the dosing or recovery periods. </p></div>

At recovery, relative spleen weight was still reduced in males but not females. Relative prostate weight was decreased at the high dose, up to 56% and did not recover. There were no histological correlates of decreased organ weight in the spleen or prostate. Decreased prostate weight was likely due to the exaggerated pharmacology of elagolix. Relative liver, adrenal, lung and salivary gland weights were increased at the high dose in males and females. Relative pituitary weight was increased in high dose males.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Histopathology adequate battery: Yes</head><p>In two high dose males, there were findings in the gall bladder: granulomatous inflammation occurred in the lamina propria of the mucosa, and was characterized by mononuclear cell infiltrates as well as the formation of multinucleated giant cells which contained variably sized clear intracytoplasmic spicules.

Higher doses (&gt; 1200 mg/kg) resulted in decreased exposure at weeks 8 and 15 presumably due to liver enzyme induction.</p><p>Key study findings:  Elagolix administered via diet at dose levels of 150, 300, and 800 mg/kg/day resulted in reduction in survival of males at 300 and 800 mg/kg/day. However, an adequate number of animals survived in all dose groups to provide a valid study for statistical analysis. Survival was unaffected in females.  The highest target dose of 800 mg/kg/day was associated with increased incidences of hepatic (males) and thyroid tumors (males and females) that were likely a rat-specific effect and were predominantly benign. No correlation was observed between survival and tumors.  The study achieved an MTD as the percent difference in body weight change (g) for the high dose group (males and females) was greater than 10% at terminal necropsy. Mean body weights were 17% and 13% lower than control for females and males, respectively. TK: 5/sex/dose.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.4.">Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology</head><p>The Applicant's NOAEL for maternal and paternal toxicity was 150 mg/kg/day due to respiratory distress leading to excessive mortality at the 300 mg/kg/day dose. However, given the dose dependence of the mortality, we set the NOAEL at 50 mg/kg/day. Other repeat dose studies had similar mortality findings due to aspiration but had higher NOAELs. TK values at the 50 mg/kg/day dose were: Males: C max = 0.7 µg/mL and AUC = 1.8 μg*h/mL on day 28.

However, because elagolix binds so poorly to the rat GnRH receptor (~1000-fold less than to the human receptor), this study does not effectively assess the effect of elagolix on fertility in humans. Dosing schedule: Males were dosed for at least 28 days prior to mating and throughout the mating period through the day prior to termination (at least 10 weeks prior to sacrifice). Females were dosed for at least 14 days prior to mating, throughout the mating period and through GD7. Females were necropsied on GD13. Deviation from study protocol: Group 2 dosing in week 6 was 65.8% of the target concentration. GD = gestation day * Dose selection was based on an EFD rat study where maternal and in-utero toxicity was assessed in pregnant rats at dose levels of 300, 600 and 1200 mg/kg/day. There were six unscheduled deaths (one in the 300, four in the 600 and one in the 1200 mg/kg/day groups). Treatment-related clinical observations included excessive salivation immediately following dosing and labored/audible respiration at 1200 mg/kg/day. There was significant decreased maternal body weight gain and food consumption during dosing in all treated groups. Caesarean section data indicated increased post-implantation loss and decreased fetal weight at 600 mg/kg/day.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key Study Findings</head><p> Elagolix was not teratogenic in the rat.  Distribution studies indicated complete penetration of elagolix across the placental barrier in the rat. Fetal exposures can therefore be assumed to be equal to maternal exposures. Exposures were achieved that were greater than the exposures expected at the MRHD.  Because binding of elagolix to the rat GnRH receptor is ~1000-fold lower than to the human receptor, this study was useful for evaluating effects on fetal development that were independent of changes in estrogen or progesterone.</p><p>The NOEL for maternal toxicity was ≤ 300 mg/kg/day, based on the likelihood that unscheduled deaths were related to aspiration of the test article.</p><p>The NOEL for fetal viability and growth was 300 mg/kg/day based on increased postimplantation loss and decreased fetal weight at 600 mg/kg/day (MOE = 20). These effects were attributed to decreased food consumption and excessive body weight loss at 600 mg/kg/day and not to a direct effect of the test article.</p><p>The NOAEL for fetal teratogenicity was 1200 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested in this study.   Mortality: There were six unscheduled deaths occurring between GD13 and 18: one each in the low and high dose groups and four in the mid dose group. The cause of death was not determined and there were minimal clinical signs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical signs</head><p>Clinical observations included labored and audible respiration in all treated groups (with the highest incidence at the mid dose) and a dose related increase in urine stains, thin appearance and few or no feces. Increased alopecia was observed at 1200 mg/kg/day.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Body weights</head><p>Elagolix produced significantly decreased mean maternal body weight gain (up to ~33% below control) in all treated groups. The decreased body weights (up to ~13% below control) correlated with significantly decreased food consumption (up to 19% below control for the treatment period). Effects on food consumption appeared to be reversible during the postdose phase (GD18 to 20). Necropsy findings cesarean section data <ref type="bibr">[implantation sites, pre-and postimplantation loss, etc.]</ref> All animals were pregnant. There were no abortions or early deliveries. All surviving dams had litters with viable fetuses. There was a slight increase in postimplantation loss at the mid dose (8.9% versus 3.5% for control), which resulted in a slight decrease in the mean number of live fetuses in this group (12.8% versus 13.6% for control). This was attributed primarily to an increase in the late resorption in a single litter and decreased food consumption and excessive body weight loss in this group. Covariant adjusted mean fetal weight was significantly decreased (~10%) at the mid dose. Necropsy findings offspring <ref type="bibr">[malformations, variations, etc.]</ref> Fetal observations: There were no fetal external anomalies or soft tissue or skeletal malformations in treated groups. Fetal skeletal variations consisted of unossified bones. Although the type of fetal skeletal variations observed were those commonly seen in this strain of rat, an increased fetal incidence occurred in all treated groups (up to 90% of fetuses versus 62% of fetuses in the control group). These increases correlated with decreased fetal weight and were considered to represent a delay in fetal development and not a direct effect of elagolix.</p></div>

There were no effects on postnatal survival at 100 mg/kg/day. There were lower mean birth weights and lower mean body weight gains for F1 males and females at the high dose, resulting in mean body weights that were generally lower than the control group throughout the pre-weaning period. Furthermore, a higher incidence of small stature (which is defined as small body size in relation to littermates) was noted for the F1 pups in the high dose group (four pups from four litters affected compared to one pup from one litter in the control group), which corresponded to the lower pup weights in this group. Mean pup body weights and body weight gains for the low dose group were similar to the control group during the postnatal period. Developmental landmarks (balanopreputial separation and vaginal patency) in the F1 offspring were unaffected all doses.

When elagolix is administered under fed conditions with a high-fat meal, C max and AUC are on average 38% and 26% lower, respectively, and the median T max is delayed by approximately 1 hour in comparison with that under fasting conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distribution:</head><p>The apparent volume of distribution of elagolix was 1674 L and 881 L after multiple doses of 150 mg QD and 200 mg BID, respectively. Elagolix is approximately 80% bound to human plasma proteins. It preferentially partitions into plasma rather than blood cellular components with a blood-to-plasma ratio of approximately 0.6.</p><p>Metabolism: Elagolix is metabolized by multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes with major contributions from CYP3A4. The contribution of CYP2D6 is approximately 20% of the total metabolism. To a lesser extent, elagolix is metabolized by CYP2C8. The contribution from UDPglucuronosyl transferase enzymes to drug metabolism is negligible. No major metabolites of elagolix were detected in human plasma.</p><p>Excretion: Elagolix is 90% excreted in the feces and 2.9% eliminated in the urine based on the recovery of total radioactivity. Biliary excretion contributes to the clearance of elagolix. The apparent terminal elimination half-life (T 1/2 ) of elagolix is approximately 4 to 6 hours.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.2.1.">General Dosing</head><p>The proposed elagolix dose is either 150 mg tablets QD or 200 mg tablets BID, to be taken orally with or without food, initiated within days of a menstrual cycle. The Applicant proposes the use of the lowest effective dose based on the severity of symptoms and treatment objectives.</p><p>Patients in two pivotal Phase 3 studies and one extension study were given elagolix under fasting conditions while the second Phase 3 extension study (M12-821) was conducted without regard to meals. The proposed drug administration with or without food is acceptable. The proposed 150 mg QD dosing regimen is acceptable for the general population of premenopausal women with endometriosis.</p><p>Due to the loss in BMD observed with 200 mg BID, we recommend that the duration of treatment with elagolix 200 mg BID be limited to 6 months.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.2.2.">Therapeutic Individualization</head><p>Hepatic Impairment: In a dedicated hepatic impairment study, the PK of a single 150 mg oral dose of elagolix was investigated in adult females with normal hepatic function (N = 6), mild stable chronic hepatic impairment (N = 6, Child-Pugh A), moderate stable chronic hepatic impairment (N = 6, Child-Pugh B), or severe stable chronic hepatic impairment (N = 4, Child-Pugh C). The AUC values of elagolix were comparable between subjects with normal hepatic function and subjects with mild hepatic impairment. Elagolix AUC values in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and subjects with severe hepatic impairment were approximately 3-fold and 7-fold, respectively, of AUC values from subjects with normal hepatic function. For the O-demethyl metabolite (M3), AUC values were similar between subjects with mild hepatic impairment and subjects with normal hepatic function. The AUC values of M3 in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and subjects with severe hepatic impairment were approximately 5.5-fold and 17-fold, respectively, of AUC values from subjects with normal hepatic function. The elagolix AUC was about 59 times the M3 AUC in subjects with normal hepatic function. In addition, the GnRH inhibition activity of M3 (IC 50 = 14nM) is lower compared to elagolix (IC 50 = 1.5nM). Thus, the 5.5-fold increase in M3 exposure in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment is not likely to contribute significantly to the overall GnRH inhibition. Based on the PK data, the Applicant proposed no dose adjustment in women with mild hepatic impairment, only 150 mg QD in women with moderate hepatic impairment, and a contraindication in women with severe hepatic impairment.</p><p>Due to the risk of bone loss, the clinical pharmacology review team recommends that the duration of treatment with elagolix 150 mg QD in women with moderate hepatic impairment be limited to 6 months, like the 200 mg BID dose in women with normal hepatic function. This recommendation is based on the 3-fold increase in elagolix AUC with the 150 mg QD dose in women with moderate hepatic impairment. conducted by the Applicant to investigate the effect of covariates such as genotype on elagolix PK. Subjects included in the population PK analysis included genotyped subjects and OATP1B1 status was identified as a significant covariate in the elagolix PK model. Our population PK analysis using the Applicant's model showed that the AUC of elagolix is expected to increase by 24% and 78% in subjects predicted to be IT and PT respectively, compared to subjects predicted to be ETs. The expected mean steady state AUC values ranged from 14.8-148.2 ng*hr/mL in ETs, 21.1-209.1 ng*hr/mL in ITs, 50.5-195.1 ng*hr/mL in PTs, and 16.8 -407.2 ng*hr/mL in subjects who had no genotype information, presenting an overlap of exposure across OATP1B1 subgroups and the non-genotyped subgroup (Refer to the clinical pharmacology review in DARRTS for pharmacometrics assessment). For IT subjects, a 24% increase in the exposure of elagolix is not expected to have a clinically meaningful impact on efficacy and safety. A 78% increase in AUC seen in PTs in comparison with ETs is approximately two standard deviations away from the mean of the ET AUC but falls within the range of values observed for extensive, intermediate and non-genotyped subgroups.</p><p>Considering 1) the variability in exposure across OATP1B1 subgroups, 2) the frequency of the SLCO1B1 521C/C genotype (PT), which is generally lower than 5% in most racial/ethnic groups, and 3) the burden that an OATP1B1 genotyping requirement would place on all patients taking elagolix, the clinical pharmacology review team does not recommend screening for the PT genotype or dose adjustment for women with the PT genotype.</p><p>Drug Interactions: The Applicant conducted 10 clinical drug interaction studies.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dose-dependent suppression of pituitary and ovarian hormones:</head><p>Similar to other approved hormonal therapies for endometriosis, elagolix primarily acts by suppressing ovulation and inducing a hypoestrogenic state. Pharmacodynamic (PD) data (LH, FSH, estradiol, and progesterone) were collected in multiple-dose Phase 1 studies (Studies M12-790, M12-654, and M12-673) in healthy premenopausal women, as well as in the pivotal Phase 3 trials 7 2</p><p>(Studies M12-665 and M12-671) and extension studies (M12-667 and M12-821). Elagolix caused a dose-dependent suppression of LH and FSH levels, leading to decreased blood levels of the ovarian sex hormones, estradiol and progesterone. Partial suppression of estradiol at low doses (e.g., 150 mg QD) and nearly full suppression of estradiol at high doses (e.g., 400 mg BID) was maintained throughout the treatment periods.</p><p>The multiple ascending dose study (Study M12-790) in 45 healthy premenopausal female volunteers assessed dose-dependent suppression of LH, FSH, estradiol and progesterone. Within 2 days after the start of their menstrual cycle, the enrolled subjects received one of 5 dose regimens of elagolix (100 mg BID, 150 mg QD, 200 mg BID, 300 mg BID, and 400 mg BID) or matching placebo for 21 consecutive days under fasting conditions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 4</ref> shows the mean hormone concentration-time profiles for each dose group. Dose-dependent suppression of LH, estradiol and progesterone was observed at all five dose levels and dose-dependent suppression of FSH at doses ≥ 200 mg BID compared to placebo. Partial suppression of estradiol appeared to be achieved at doses of 150 mg QD and 100 mg BID. Maximal suppression of estradiol appeared to be achieved at doses ≥200 mg BID. Dose-response for estradiol suppression ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 5</ref>) was assessed at steady state using elagolix dose and estradiol AUC 0-21day . An elagolix daily dose of approximately 70 mg/day is estimated to suppress estradiol by 50% relative to placebo. Maximal suppression of estradiol appears to be achieved at approximately 200 mg BID.</p><p>A 7-day, multiple-dose study (Study M12-654) conducted in Asian subjects showed similar dosedependent hormonal suppression at doses of 150 mg QD and 200 mg BID. In another 84-day study (Study M12-673) conducted in 205 adult premenopausal women at doses of 100 mg BID, 100 mg QD, 150 mg QD, 200 mg QD, 200 mg BID, and 300 mg BID; similar dose-dependent suppression of LH, LSH, estradiol, and progesterone was observed over the treatment period. The long-term effects of elagolix on LH, LSH, and estradiol were assessed in Phase 3 studies. As shown below in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 6</ref>, in the pivotal efficacy Study M12-671, both 150 mg QD and 200 mg BID dosing regimens suppressed estradiol and LH compared to placebo during the 6-month treatment period. However, the effects on FSH differed between these two regimens-elagolix 200 mg BID appeared to lower FSH concentrations compared to placebo, while elagolix 150 mg QD appeared to slightly raise FSH concentrations compared to placebo. Similar results were observed in the second pivotal Study M12-665 (not shown). Similar findings of hormonal suppression were also seen in the extension Phase 3 Studies M12-667 and M12-821 up to 12 months of treatment (not shown). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dose-dependent suppression of ovulation:</head><p>In women with endometriosis, ovulation can make the symptoms of endometriosis worse. In Study M12-673, the Applicant assessed the effect of different dosing regimens of elagolix (alone or with the hormonal add-back therapy Activella, estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 7 5 mg) on ovulation for up to 84 days of treatment. Ovulation was defined by an adjudication committee and manual adjudication was conducted for each cycle for each subject (Refer to the clinical pharmacology review in DARRTS for details). As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_19">Table 18</ref>, the ovulation rate was the highest for the 100 mg QD treatment. The ovulation rates with elagolix 150 mg QD, 200 mg QD and 100 mg BID were similar, at approximately 50% by subject count. The ovulation rate with 200 mg BID was 31.7% and further decreased with 300 mg BID alone and with 300 mg BID hormonal add-back. Overall, the results showed a dose-dependent suppression of ovulation, which provided supportive evidence of the effectiveness of elagolix.  </p></div>

The proposed regimens are supported by clinical efficacy, safety, PK and PD data. However, due to BMD loss, the duration of treatment with elagolix 200 mg BID and 150 mg QD will be limited to 6 months and 24 months, respectively. See Section 8 for a detailed discussion of the efficacy and safety findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>QT prolongation</head><p>The effect of elagolix on QT prolongation was evaluated in healthy premenopausal women. There was no significant QTc prolongation with a single dose of 300 mg or 1200 mg. With 1200 mg, the mean C max value (13229 ± 4218 ng/mL) was ~17-fold the mean steady-state C max (774 ± 530 ng/mL) at the maximum recommended dose of 200 mg BID.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bone Mineral Density:</head><p>Long-term estradiol suppression by elagolix causes a decrease in BMD.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applicability of Efficacy Data to the U.S. Population:</head><p>Among the 1,686 treated subjects in the two pivotal Phase 3 trials, most were white (88.1%); the remainder were: 8.8% black or African American, 0.9% Asian, and 14.7% Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Three quarters (74.8%) of the subjects were enrolled at study sites in the U.S. and Canada. Population PK analyses did not indicate that race, ethnicity, or study region (U.S. sites or non-U.S. sites) were significantly associated with elagolix PK parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.2.3.">Is an alternative dosing regimen or management strategy required for subpopulations based on intrinsic patient factors?</head><p>Renal Impairment:</p><p>In a dedicated renal impairment study (Study M12-655), the PK of a single 200 mg oral dose of elagolix was characterized in adult women with normal renal function or mild renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 , N = 6), moderate to severe renal impairment (eGFR between 15 and &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 , N = 3), and end stage renal disease (ESRD, eGFR &lt; 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 , N = 6) with 5 subjects requiring dialysis. The mean PK parameters of elagolix in female subjects with normal renal function or mild impairment, moderate to severe renal impairment, or ESRD are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_21">Table 19</ref>. Comparable exposure of elagolix was observed in subjects with varying renal function status. Renal impairment did not result in a significantly higher exposure of elagolix. * Subject was excluded from analysis. Refer to the clinical pharmacology review in DARRT for more information. AUC = area under the curve, PK = pharmacokinetic, CL/F = oral clearance, ESRD = end-stage renal disease, SD = standard deviation A plasma binding study showed that renal impairment status did not impact protein binding of elagolix. We agree with the Applicant's proposal that no dose adjustment is recommended in women with any degree of renal impairment or ESRD (including women on dialysis).</p><p>The effect of hemodialysis on the PK of elagolix in subjects with ESRD was not studied. Based on the large volume of distribution of elagolix (1674 L for 150 mg QD and 881 L for 200 mg BID) and high nonrenal clearance of elagolix (approximately 2 L/min), only a small fraction of elagolix in the body is expected to be removed by dialysis. Therefore, no dose adjustment of elagolix is required in patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis. Hepatic Impairment: In a dedicated hepatic impairment study, the PK of a single 150 mg oral dose of elagolix was investigated in adult women with normal hepatic function (N = 6), mild stable chronic hepatic impairment (N = 6, Child-Pugh A), moderate stable chronic hepatic impairment (N = 6, Child-Pugh B), or severe stable chronic hepatic impairment (N = 4, Child-Pugh C). <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 20</ref>, the mean AUC value of elagolix is comparable between subjects with normal hepatic function and subjects with mild hepatic impairment. Elagolix AUC values in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and subjects with severe hepatic impairment were approximately 3-fold and 7-fold, respectively, of AUC values in subjects with normal hepatic function. The human mass balance study (Study NBI-56418-0601) showed that two oxidative metabolites (O-demethy and N-dealkyl metabolites) constitute 2.4% and 3.3% of exposure relative to elagolix. For the O-demethy metabolite (M3), AUC values were similar between subjects with mild hepatic impairment and subjects with normal hepatic function. The AUC values of M3 in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and subjects with severe hepatic impairment were approximately 5.4-fold and 17-fold, respectively, of AUC values in subjects with normal hepatic function. The M3 to elagolix AUC ratio observed in subjects with normal hepatic function was small (1.7%). Furthermore, the human GnRH receptor inhibition activity of M3 (IC 50 = 14 nM) is lower compared to elagolix (IC 50 = 1.5 nM). Thus, the increased exposure of M3 in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment is not likely to contribute significantly to the overall GnRH receptor inhibition. For the N-dealkyl metabolite (M6x), AUC 0-inf appeared to be 32% and 22% lower in subjects with mild and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. M6x AUC 0-inf was 27% higher in subjects with moderate impairment. The 20 to 30% changes in M6x exposure is unlikely to have a clinically relevant impact on efficacy or safety in subjects with hepatic impairment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>As shown in</head><p>Based on the PK data of elagolix and its metabolites, the Applicant proposed no dose adjustment in women with mild hepatic impairment, only the elagolix 150 mg QD regimen to be used by women with moderate hepatic impairment, and a contraindication of both 150 mg QD and 200 mg BID regimens in women with severe hepatic impairment. Due to the risk of bone loss with the 3-fold increase in elagolix systemic exposures, we recommend that the NDA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 210450} {Orilissa and elagolix sodium} <ref type="formula">7 8</ref> duration of treatment with elagolix 150 mg QD in women with moderate hepatic impairment be limited to 6 months.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OATP1B1 Transporter Genotype Status:</head><p>Population PK analysis identified that the OATP1B1 genotype status was a significant covariate for elagolix CL/F. In this analysis, subjects were divided into three groups: unknown status group, extensive transporter function (ET) group and combined intermediate/poor transporter function (IT/PT) group. The population PK analysis showed that subjects in the IT/PT combined group had 14% lower elagolix CL/F compared to subjects in the ET group. The Applicant claimed that the minor decrease in elagolix CL/F would not result in clinically meaningful changes in elagolix exposure and no dose adjustment in subjects with OATP1B1 IT or PT status was proposed.</p><p>The clinical pharmacology review team does not agree with pooling OATP1B1 IT and PT subjects in the population PK analysis because a pooling analysis does not show the difference in elagolix CL/F between IT and PT subjects and the sample size of PT subjects (N = 30) is reasonably adequate for a categorical analysis. Our population PK analysis showed that the mean CL/F values of elagolix in IT subjects and PT subjects were lower than that in subjects with the ET genotype and undetermined genotype (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">Figure 7</ref> and refer to the clinical pharmacology review in DARRTS for more information). As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 21</ref>, the AUC of elagolix in subjects with the IT genotype or PT genotype is expected to increase by 24% and 78%, respectively, compared to subjects with the ET genotype (normal OATP1B1 transporter function).  The 24% increase in the exposure of elagolix in ITs is not expected to have a clinically meaningful impact on efficacy and safety and no dose adjustment is recommended in this subgroup. Because of the variability of elagolix exposures across OATP1B1 subgroups, the 78% increase in elagolix AUC among the PTs overlaps with exposures in the other subgroups and the clinical pharmacology review team does not recommend dose adjustment for these women.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Age:</head><p>The mean age of the subjects included in the population PK analysis was 32.3 ± 6.5 years and the age range was 18 to 49 years. Our population PK analysis confirmed the Applicant's finding that age did not affect the clearance of elagolix (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">Figure 8</ref> and refer to the clinical pharmacology review in DARRTS for more information). These data do not suggest a need for age-based dose adjustment. The Applicant's subgroup analysis for BMD showed that there was no apparent trend in mean percent changes in femoral neck, hip and lumbar spine BMD from baseline corresponding with increasing age compared to placebo at month 6 of 150 mg QD or 200 mg BID treatments <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table  22)</ref>. Overall, consistent elagolix PK and changes in BMD were observed in subjects aged 18 to 49 years. The clinical pharmacology review team agrees with the Applicant that no age-based dose adjustment is recommended for premenopausal women with endometriosis. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Race and Ethnicity:</head><p>Our population PK analysis evaluating the effect of race on elagolix clearance between black subjects (N = 194, 11.9%) and white/other subjects (N = 1430, 88.1%) did not detect a significant difference in elagolix CL/F between these two racial groups <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">(Figure 9</ref>). Our population PK analysis evaluating the effect of ethnicity on elagolix clearance between Hispanics (N = 272, 16.7%) and others (N = 1352, 83.3%) did not detect a significant difference in elagolix CL/F between these two ethnic groups (Refer to the clinical pharmacology review in DARRTS for more information). The Applicant conducted a multiple-dose PK study (Study M12-654) in California to compare the PK and PD of elagolix in Japanese and Han Chinese. The PK results are shown in the table below. The mean C max and AUC values between Japanese and Han Chinese were comparable. The Applicant compared the Asian PK parameters with the PK parameters of white and black subjects collected from Study M12-790. Based on this cross-study comparison, the Applicant concluded that elagolix PK parameters are similar between Japanese, Han Chinese, white and black subjects and no dose adjustment is required based on race. Based on these population PK results, we concur that there is no clinically meaningful difference in the PK of elagolix between white and black subjects or between Hispanics and non-Hispanics. We also concur that there is no clinically meaningful difference in the PK of elagolix between Japanese and Han Chinese. However, it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions based on the cross-study PK comparison between Asian and Western subjects. In addition, only 16 Asian subjects were enrolled in the two pivotal Phase 3 trials and only 7 of them received elagolix treatment. Neither a population PK analysis nor efficacy/safety subgroup analysis for the Asian group was conducted due to the very limited data from Asian subjects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Body Weight and Body Mass Index (BMI):</head><p>The mean body weight of the 1624 subjects included in the population PK analysis was 73.7 ± 17.3 kg and the body weight range was 40 to 148 kg. The mean BMI was 27.3 ± 6.2 kg/m 2 and the BMI range was 16.2 to 55.6 kg/m 2 . Our population PK analysis showed that the CL/F of elagolix was not affected by body weight or BMI ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 10</ref>, Refer to the clinical pharmacology review in DARRTS for more information). These data do not suggest a need for body weightbased or BMI-based dose adjustment. The Applicant's subgroup analysis showed no apparent trend in mean percent changes from baseline in femoral neck, hip, and lumbar spine BMD across BMI subgroups for elagolix 150 mg QD compared to placebo at month 6. For elagolix 200 mg BID compared to placebo at month 6, there was an apparent trend in mean percent changes from baseline in femoral neck, hip and lumbar spine BMD corresponding with increasing BMI (lower BMI, larger decrease in BMD). Overall, population PK analysis showed that subject body weight or BMI is not a significant covariate associated with elagolix CL/F. For 200 mg BID treatment, the large BMD decrease from baseline to month 6 (-3.74%) observed in BMI &lt; 25 kg/m 2 subgroup is a safety concern, which we believe can be mitigated with the 6-month limitation in treatment duration. We do not recommend dose adjustment based on body weight or BMI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.2.4.">Are there clinically relevant food-drug or drug-drug interactions, and what is the appropriate management strategy?</head><p>Food Effects: Elagolix was administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal in three Phase 3 trials (Studies M12-665, M12-667, and M12-671), and was administered without regard to meals in extension trial Study M12-821. A dedicated food effect study, using a single 200 mg dose (Study M15-817), was conducted with the commercial formulation in healthy premenopausal women. The Applicant's calculation showed that under high-fat meal conditions, there was a decrease of 24% and 36% in elagolix AUC and C max , respectively, relative to fasted conditions (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 25</ref>). The Applicant's exposure-response analyses and simulations showed that the decrease of elagolix exposure under fed conditions did not have a clinically meaningful impact on efficacy. We concur with the Applicant that elagolix can be taken without regard to meals and no dose adjustment is recommended under fed conditions. formulation 150 mg tablet had the greatest decrease in elagolix AUC (42%) and C max (66%) under fed conditions. The formulation was administered under fasted conditions in Phase 3 studies (M12-665, M12-667, and M12-671) and thus the observed food effect on this formulation did not affect the efficacy and safety findings in the Phase 3 studies. Under fed conditions, a decrease in elagolix exposure was also observed with the NBI formulation 50 mg tablet, the formulation 150 mg tablet, the formulation 200 mg tablet, and formulation 200 mg tablet. These four formulations were not used in any other clinical studies. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Drug-Drug Interactions:</head><p>Elagolix is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6, followed by CYP2C8. In vitro tests showed that elagolix is a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 (K i 74μM), CYP2C8 (K i 82μM) and CYP2C19 (K i 34μM), an inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and a potential inducer of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. In vitro drug interaction studies revealed that elagolix is a substrate of P-gp and OATP1B1 transporters and an inhibitor of OATP1B1 (IC 50 1.7µM), OATP1B3 (IC 50 4.7µM), P-gp (IC 50 54µM), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP; IC 50 150µM) transporters. With an observed mean elagolix C max of 774 ng/ml (1.23µM) following dosing of elagolix 200 mg twice daily, the in vitro studies suggest that therapeutic doses of elagolix are not expected to inhibit CYP enzymes but may cause inhibition of OATP1B1.</p><p>The Applicant conducted ten clinical studies and one physiologically-based pharmacokinetics modeling study to assess the drug-drug interactions (DDIs) of elagolix. The clinical DDI study findings and management strategies are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 16</ref>.</p><p>Study M12-660 showed that co-administration of ketoconazole 400 mg QD and a single dose of elagolix 150 mg caused an increase of elagolix AUC by 120%. A mean decrease of 3.22% in BMD was observed in 13 subjects who were treated with elagolix 200 mg BID for less than 6 months in Phase 3 trials. Due to the concern over bone loss which is heightened when elagolix exposures are increased, we recommend that concomitant use of elagolix 200 mg BID dose and strong CYP3A inhibitors be limited to 1 month and that concomitant use of elagolix 150 mg QD dose and strong CYP3A inhibitors be limited to 6 months.</p><p>A single dose of rifampin 600 mg, which is expected to inhibit hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1, caused an increase of elagolix AUC by 458% (Study M12-659). When coadministered with a potent OATP1B1 inhibitor, the 150 mg QD regimen of elagolix would result in a drug exposure around 800 mg QD elagolix administered alone. The maximum single-dose exposure of elagolix in human was 1200 mg and the maximum multi-dose exposures in humans were 400 mg BID for 21 days and 600 mg QD for 24 weeks. Based on the 5.6-fold increase in elagolix AUC with potent OATP1B1 inhibitors, we recommend that concomitant use of elagolix and potent OATP1B1 inhibitors be contraindicated. Rifampin is a special case with complex drug interactions with elagolix. Study M12-659 also evaluated the effect of administering rifampin 600 mg QD for 10 days, which is expected to inhibit OATP1B1, induce CYP3A enzymes and P-gp, and potentially also induce OATP1B1 transporters. The net effect of OATP1B1 inhibition and CYP3A/P-gp/OATP1B1 induction caused an increase of elagolix AUC by only 65% on day 10. When co-administered with rifampin 600 mg QD, the 150 mg QD regimen of elagolix would result in a drug exposure equivalent to 800 mg elagolix daily dose on day 1 and 250 mg elagolix daily dose on day 10. Concomitant use of rifampin 600 mg QD and elagolix 200 mg BID would result in an exposure of elagolix equivalent to 1100 mg BID on day 1 and 330 mg BID on day 10. Considering both the OATP1B1 inhibition and CYP3A/P-gp/OATP1B1 induction by rifampin, we recommend that concomitant use of elagolix 200 mg BID and rifampin be avoided and concomitant use of elagolix 150 mg QD dose and rifampin be limited to 6 months.</p><p>Co-administration of rosuvastatin 20 mg QD at steady-state with the first 300 mg dose of elagolix resulted in an increase of rosuvastatin C max by 67% and a comparable AUC to rosuvastatin administered alone (Study M13-756). Co-administration of rosuvastatin 20 mg QD at steady-state with multiple dose of elagolix 300 mg BID resulted in a comparable rosuvastatin C max to rosuvastatin administered alone and a decrease of rosuvastatin AUC by approximately 40%. The mechanisms for the decrease in rosuvastatin AUC when co-administered with multiple doses of elagolix is unknown. OATP1B1 induction by elagolix may be one of the possible mechanisms.</p><p>The Applicant assessed the DDIs between elagolix 150 mg QD and norethindrone 0.35 mg QD in Study M12-765. No clinically meaningful changes in the PK of norethindrone were observed. The Applicant proposed that no dose adjustment is required for concomitant use of elagolix with progestin-only oral contraceptives. However, because norethindrone is not the most sensitive substrate of CYP3A enzymes among orally administered progestins, results from Study M12-765 cannot be generalized to other progestins. In addition, the dose of elagolix (150 mg QD) assessed in Study M12-765 did not cover the proposed 200 mg BID dosing regimen. While we recommend no dose adjustment for concomitant use of elagolix 150 mg QD with oral norethindrone, the potential DDIs between elagolix 200 mg BID and progestins remain unknown. The Applicant also assessed the DDIs between elagolix 150 mg QD and ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate in Study M12-651. However, that study also did not cover the proposed 200 mg BID dosing regimen. Study M12-651 showed no clinically meaningful changes in the PK of norgestimate metabolites (norelgestromin and norgestrel) but reported an unexpected 30% increase in exposure of ethinyl estradiol. We recommend a postmarketing commitment to assess the effect of elagolix 200 mg BID on the pharmacokinetics of an oral combination hormonal contraceptive.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trial Design</head><p>The purpose of both studies M12-665 (hereafter, Study 665) and M12-671 (hereafter, Study 671) was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of two doses of elagolix for 3 months in the management of moderate to severe endometriosis-associated pain.</p><p>In both Studies 665 and 671, subjects were randomized into one of three parallel dose armselagolix 150 mg QD, elagolix 200 mg BID, and placebo -in a 3:2:2 ratio.</p><p>The study consisted of a wash out period (if applicable), a screening period (up to 100 days), a 6-month treatment period, and if the subject declined the extension trial, a post treatment follow up period (PTFU) for up to 12 months, until the subject had return of menses and had demonstrated pre-specified bone recovery. Subjects who prematurely withdrew from the treatment period would enter the PTFU period upon discontinuation of drug. An extension trial for an additional 6 months of treatment was available for subjects who were eligible and desired continued treatment (see Studies M12-667 and M12-821). A diagram of the four study periods is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 11</ref> below. A Washout period was required for subjects who were taking any hormonal contraceptives, estrogen or progestin preparations (including a progestin intrauterine system [IUS]), GnRH agonists or antagonists, aromatase inhibitors, and Danazol. Dual non-hormonal contraception was required for participation and monthly pregnancy tests were performed.</p><p>A subject's eligibility was determined by self-assessment of EAP, medical history and examination, and baseline laboratory and imaging studies. Once eligible, subjects enrolled into the treatment period starting the first dose of study drug between days 1 to 10 of menses. Subjects maintained an electronic daily diary (e-Diary) recording of EAP intensity, numeric rating score (NRS), analgesic medication and time study medication was taken.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key inclusion criteria:</head><p>1. Premenopausal woman between 18 to 49 years of age 2. Clinical diagnosis of endometriosis established by documentation of surgical visualization within 10 years of entry 3. Must agree to use only analgesic rescue medication (i.e. not prophylaxis) for EAP and use only the two medications provided for in the study 4. Must agree to use two forms of non-hormonal contraception unless sterilization of subject or sexual partner 5. Must have a menstrual cycle of 24 to 38 days prior to Screening and at least two menstrual cycles each with 24 to 38 days duration prior to starting study drug To ensure the subjects had moderate to severe EAP for inclusion into the treatment period, the subject: 1. Must have a Composite Pelvic Signs and Symptoms Score (CPSSS, see below) total score of ≥ 6 at screening with a score of at least 2 for DYS and at least 2 for NMPP 2. Have at least 2 days of moderate or severe pain for both DYS and NMPP during the last 35 calendar days of the screening period, prior to starting study drug 3. Have an average daily e-Diary score of at least 0.5 for NMPP during the last 35 calendar days of the Screening period 4. Subject must have at least one of the following: (a) average of NMPP during screening of at least 1 during the last 35 calendar days of the screening period or (b) at least 4 days of moderate or severe NMPP during the last 35 calendar days of the Screening period 5. Must have moderate or severe pain for DYS and NMPP using the Monthly Assessment of Endometriosis Pain instrument on day 1 Key exclusion criteria: 1. History of hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, surgery that might interfere with gastrointestinal motility or absorption (gastric, bowel, vagotomy); recent surgery for endometriosis (major within 6 months, any within 3 months) 2. Pregnant, breast feeding, or planning pregnancy within 24 months, less than 6 months post-partum or post-pregnancy 3. History of previous non-response to medical treatment for endometriosis, chronic pelvic pain not caused by endometriosis or other chronic pain syndrome, history of drug or alcohol abuse within 1 year 4. History of significant sensitivity to elagolix, use of prohibited drugs within 1 month, bone disease or major depression within 2 years 5. IUS in place 6. Positive hepatitis testing or positive HIV 7. Abnormality in chemistry, hematology, urinalysis; abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG); or abnormal BMD 8. Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding or a gynecologic abnormality found on screening, including: complex ovarian cyst &gt; 3 cm or simple ovarian cyst &gt; 5 cm that persists, endometrial pathology, single fibroid &gt; 4 cm, or more than four fibroids that measure ≥ 2 cm, or a symptomatic submucosal fibroid of any size. The B&amp;B includes three symptoms -dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, and dyspareunia, and two signs -pelvic tenderness and induration, each of which are graded on a scale from 0 to 3 (or 4 for dyspareunia), with higher numbers indicating more severe symptoms. After convening an international meeting in 2010, the National Institutes of Health and the American Society of Reproductive Medicine concluded that the B&amp;B appeared "not to have been used or administered in a consistent manner, and it has never been validated or shown to be reproducible." 4</p><p>In their Phase 2 studies, the Applicant began using a rating instrument -the Composite Pelvic Signs and Symptoms Score (CPSSS) -to assess pain. The CPSSS consisted of two sections. Section 1 asked the subjects to respond to the original B&amp;B questions regarding dysmenorrhea, non-menstrual pelvic pain, and dyspareunia and was to be completed by the study coordinator based on the subject's verbal responses from a 28-day recall period. Section 2 was to be completed by the investigator based on pelvic examination findings (i.e., pelvic tenderness and induration). Each individual component of the CPSSS was recorded on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe). A modified version of CPSSS (which posed questions to subjects using wording modified from the original B&amp;B) was used in the elagolix Phase 3 program.</p><p>Using the CPSSS as the prototype, the Applicant developed the Endometriosis Daily Pain Impact Scale, which utilized an electronic diary for the subjects to record a daily assessment of dyspareunia and non-menstrual pelvic pain using a 4-point scale that assessed both pain and daily function, to address the recommendations from the 2010 National Institutes of Health and the American Society of Reproductive Medicine meeting. At the End-of-Phase 2 meeting held on March 28, 2011, the FDA agreed that this scale would be appropriate for Phase 3 studies and that dysmenorrhea, non-menstrual pelvic pain, and dyspareunia would be assessed using this scale in the clinical program. Samples of the response options are listed below in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 33</ref> to <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 35</ref>.   The screening period involved assessment of the subject's baseline pain scores to confirm moderate to severe EAP. Evaluation of the CPSSS, the Monthly Assessment of Endometriosis Pain instrument, and e-Diary for endometriosis pain assessment and NRS were also used to determine severity of EAP.</p><p>Each element of the CPSSS is scored from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) for a maximal value of 15. A total score for CPSSS of ≥ 6, with a score of at least 2 for DYS and at least 2 for NMPP was required to qualify for randomization.</p><p>During the 6-month treatment period, monthly clinic visits occurred with laboratory testing, assessments of pain and function, and dispensation of the study drug. The Monthly Assessment of Endometriosis Pain instrument asked the subject to evaluate her EAP, both DYS and NMPP, over the last 28 days at the end of the screening period and before randomization occurred.</p><p>The e-Diary was an electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePRO) device developed to evaluate each subject's pain (DYS, NMPP, DYSP), presence of uterine bleeding, use of rescue analgesics for EAP, NRS, and the time medication was taken. The subject was to complete the diary every 24 hours, preferably at approximately the same time each day.</p><p>The e-Diary response options for DYS and NMPP were identical to those included in the Monthly Assessment of Pain instrument. Use of rescue analgesia for EAP captured medication name, dose and total number of pills taken within each 24-hour period. The NRS was an 11point scale used to measure EAP with and without menstruation and asked the subject to "Choose the number that best describes your endometriosis pain over the last 24 hours at its worst," between 0 and 10.</p><p>NDA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 210450} {Orilissa and elagolix sodium} 9 6</p><p>The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) was collected monthly and queried the subject to evaluate the change in her EAP since the initiation of the study drug by choosing one of seven responses. The PGIC asks the subject, "Since I started taking the study medication, my endometriosis related pain has: very much improved (1), much improved <ref type="formula">(2)</ref>, minimally improved <ref type="formula">(3)</ref>, no change (4), minimally worse <ref type="formula">(5)</ref>, much worse <ref type="formula">(6)</ref>, very much worse <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(7)</ref>."</p><p>The Assessment of Menstruation and Endometriosis Pain instrument was completed by a study coordinator based on verbal subject responses regarding menstrual bleeding pattern and EAP after study drug was discontinued. This outcome scale was used to assess when menstruation returned in the PTFU period. In months 7 to 12 in the PTFU period, when the e-Diary was no longer used, the Assessment of Menstruation and Endometriosis Pain instrument was utilized for durability of effect and return of endometriosis symptoms.</p><p>Analgesic rescue therapy was provided by the study site and was to be used for rescue EAP only. There were slight variations of the pain medication due to availability and standard of care in the different countries, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 36</ref>. Removal of subjects occurred if the subject withdrew consent, safety issues developed, the subject used exclusionary medications or had surgical intervention for treatment of endometriosis or uterine bleeding, and for noncompliance. Subjects who prematurely withdrew during the treatment period were expected to continue in the PTFU period for up to 12 months. However, subjects having surgical intervention for treatment of endometriosis did not enter the PTFU period. Follow up dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans, if required in these subjects, was to be performed according to study schedule. Subjects with ongoing adverse events (AEs) or abnormal laboratory results were followed by the investigator until resolution of the result or AE.</p><p>If a subject became pregnant during the Treatment or PTFU periods, the subject was to discontinue the study drug. An ultrasound examination in the first trimester of pregnancy to assess the conception date was performed. Information regarding pregnancy occurrence and the outcome of the pregnancy was collected. For pregnancies resulting in delivery of a live infant, the health of the infant was obtained at routine post-partum visit, 6 months, and 12 months after delivery.</p><p>Subject compliance with the study drug was based on documentation by study site personnel of returned drug containers. The study drugs were taken orally, twice a day. The doses were to be taken under fasting conditions (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal) with water, approximately 12 hours apart.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol Amendments</head><p>There were three amendments to Study 665 protocol, the last one dated August 4, 2014.</p><p>The amendments allowed expanded time for diagnosis of endometriosis, the screening period, and days from menses to initial treatment. The final protocol included the final ranking of secondary endpoints and updated statistical information to reflect the statistical analysis plan.</p><p>There were four amendments to Study 671 protocol, the last one dated July 13, 2015.</p><p>The amendments reflected the amendments noted in Study 665; additionally, post-traumatic stress disorder and attempted suicide were added to exclusion criteria and buprenorphine was added to prohibited narcotic analgesics. Management of BMD loss was updated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Endpoints</head><p>The studies have two co-primary efficacy endpoints:</p><p>(1) The proportion of DYS responders at month 3 (2) The proportion of NMPP responders at month 3</p><p>The data for these endpoints came from the mutually exclusive scales for daily assessment of DYS and NMPP measured by the modified B&amp;B scales using the daily electronic Diary. This assessment is termed the Endometriosis Daily Pain Impact Scale by the Applicant. A responder was to be determined by a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve using the PGIC responses at month 3 from the blinded data to identify the point on the curve where a clinically meaningful result occurred. The use of analgesic medication for EAP was included in the responder definition, as explained in further detail below. These endpoints were also assessed at 6 months for persistence of efficacy.</p><p>Secondary efficacy endpoints were assessed using the e-Diary and questionnaires. The secondary efficacy variables were ranked as follows:</p><p>1. Change from baseline to month 3 in the NRS for pain 2. Change from baseline to month 6 in DYS 3. Change from baseline to month 6 in NMPP 4. Change from baseline to month 3 in analgesic use across both classes of rescue analgesics based on pill counts 5. Change from baseline to month 6 in analgesic use across both classes of rescue analgesics based on pill counts 6. Change from baseline to month 3 in dyspareunia 7. Change from baseline to month 3 in use of narcotics based on pill counts</p><p>The ranking of secondary endpoints changed with each protocol amendment. In 2014, the Division encouraged prioritizing dyspareunia in the secondary endpoint hierarchy by moving it to the first position in this list. The Division also encouraged assessment of dyspareunia at month 6 to demonstrate persistence of treatment benefit for dyspareunia.</p><p>There were numerous non-ranked secondary efficacy, exploratory, pharmacokinetic, and additional endpoints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.2.">Statistical Methodologies</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Size Consideration</head><p>Both studies assumed responder rates of 55% for the elagolix dose groups and 29% for placebo. Study 665 planned to enroll approximately 875 subjects, with 250 subjects in the elagolix 150 mg QD group, 250 subjects in the elagolix 200 mg BID group, and 375 subjects in the placebo group, representing a randomization ratio of 2:2:3. Study 671 planned to enroll approximately 788 subjects, with 225 subjects in the elagolix 150 mg QD group, 225 subjects in the elagolix 200 mg BID group, and 338 subjects in the placebo group, also representing a randomization ratio of 2:2:3. In each study, these sample sizes provided greater than 90% power to detect a difference between either elagolix dose group and placebo in response rate based on a twosided test at the significance level of α = 0.025.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis Populations</head><p>The Applicant's statistical analysis plan predefined the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) analysis population for all efficacy analyses and the Safety analysis population for safety analyses. For both studies, the MITT and Safety analysis populations were identical, including all randomized subjects who had received at least one dose of study drug.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Handling of Missing Data</head><p>Missing data were handled using the following methods when applicable:</p><p> Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF), and  Observed Cases (OC): no imputation was done If a subject reported only one type of pain (DYS or NMPP, mutually exclusive Biberoglu and Behrman scale) and the other type of pain was reported as missing in the corresponding time frame of interest (e.g., month 3 DYS score is missing because the subject only reported NMPP in the 35-calendar-day period prior to and including the month 3 PGIC assessment), then the monthly average pain score for the relevant parameter (DYS or NMPP) was set to zero.</p><p>The responder analyses for the two co-primary efficacy endpoints were based on observed data except for subjects who prematurely discontinued at or before month 3. Subjects who prematurely discontinued at or before month 3 and had missing data had their last nonmissing values carried forward (LOCF) from the previous time point when both monthly average pain score and analgesic use were observed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Handling of Multiplicity</head><p>The Bonferroni adjustment was used to control the overall type I error rate of 0.05 for the coprimary endpoints. For each of the two elagolix dose groups, the comparison to placebo was considered statistically significant for each co-primary endpoint if the two-sided P-value was less than or equal to 0.025. Both co-primary endpoints must achieve statistical significance for an elagolix dose group for that dose to be considered more efficacious than placebo.</p><p>For each elagolix dose group that was statistically significantly more efficacious than placebo for the co-primary endpoints, a fixed-sequence approach was applied to maintain the familywise type I error rate for the ranked secondary endpoints. For an elagolix dose group to be considered statistically significantly better than placebo on a ranked secondary endpoint, the two-sided P-value must be less than or equal to 0.025 for that secondary endpoint and for all higher-ranking secondary endpoints (and for the co-primary endpoints). The ranked secondary endpoints were tested in the order stated above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoints</head><p>For each of the co-primary endpoints, a subject was considered to be a responder at month 3 if:</p><p>(1) she had an absolute reduction of X or greater from baseline in pain scores (DYS or NMPP); and (2) she was not a non-responder based on her analgesic use (see Appendix, section Analgesic Use).</p><p>We agreed with determining the threshold X in each study based on a ROC analysis using the PGIC assessment at month 3 as an anchor using the blinded data before database lock.</p><p>The threshold determination was carried out in the following steps for each co-primary endpoint:</p><p></p><p>Step 1: Before data unblinding, all subjects in the MITT population regardless of treatment assignment were categorized into two groups (i.e., PGIC responder and PGIC non-responder) based on the PGIC response at month 3. Subjects were defined as PGIC responders if their response was "much improved" or "very much improved;" subjects with all other responses were classified as PGIC non-responders.  Step 2: Using PGIC responder/nonresponder as a dependent variable, a logistic regression model was fit with change from baseline in the pain endpoint as the covariate to perform a ROC analysis.  Step 3: Chose the threshold for the change from baseline in the pain endpoint to minimize 1 1 for all possible thresholds (i.e. all values of change from baseline in the pain endpoint).</p><p>In the ROC analysis, subjects who prematurely discontinued at or before month 3 had their pain scores and PGIC response carried forward (LOCF) -from the previous time point when both PGIC and pain score data were observed. PGIC scores of 4 ("No change") were assigned to some individuals with missing data. These were subjects who: a) prematurely discontinued at or before month 3 and had no PGIC data to carry forward; or b) prematurely discontinued after month 3 and had no month 3 PGIC score; or c) completed the treatment period of the study, but were missing the month 3 PGIC score. Individuals missing month 3 change from baseline pain values were assigned change from baseline pain values of 0 in a similar fashion.</p><p>The primary analysis of each of the co-primary endpoints was based on a logistic regression model with the responder/non-responder categorization as the dependent variable, treatment as the main effect, and baseline pain score (DYS or NMPP) as the covariate.</p><p>One sensitivity analysis classified all subjects who prematurely discontinued the study drug at or before month 3 as non-responders. Another sensitivity analysis used only observed data. Other sensitivity analyses were also prespecified in the Applicant's analysis plan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Ranked Secondary Efficacy Endpoints</head><p>All ranked secondary efficacy endpoints data were evaluated with mixed-effects model repeated measures analysis. The mixed-effects model repeated measures analysis included the treatment group, visit, and treatment group-by-visit interaction, and the continuous baseline score of the endpoint being analyzed as a covariate. A random subject effect term was included to account for the correlation among the repeated measurements in the changes from baseline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FDA's Additional Analysis</head><p>To evaluate the appropriateness of the Applicant's responder thresholds, we explored the data further by examining the cumulative distribution function and probability density function by each level of categorical change on the anchor to find responder thresholds and reanalyzed the co-primary efficacy endpoints using these thresholds to define responders.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient Disposition</head><p>Subject disposition was similar in Study 665 and Study 671 <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">(Table 37)</ref>. Study 665 screened a total of 2248 subjects with 872 (38.7%) of the subjects randomized. One subject failed screening but was randomized in error and was never dispensed the study drug. Study 671 screened a total of 2163 subjects with 817 (37.8%) of the subjects randomized. Two subjects were randomized in error and never received the study drug and one subject was enrolled 3 times. A total of 815 subjects were treated with the study drug.</p><p>Duration of treatment was 6 months and about 75% of subjects in both studies completed the treatment period. About 60% of subjects randomized into the double-blind trials enrolled in the respective extension studies. In both studies, reasons for premature withdrawal were categorized identically except for "lack of efficacy," which was a reason in study 671 but not in study 665. The subjects' reasons for withdrawal in the treatment period as presented by the Applicant are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 38</ref>. Premature discontinuation due to adverse events (AE) was highest in the 200 mg BID treatment arm while discontinuation due to withdrawn consent and subject noncompliance was highest in the placebo arm (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 39</ref>). Pregnancy occurred in all three arms with a larger proportion in the placebo arm. A low incidence of invasive intervention for endometriosis was reported in all three arms.</p><p>We do not agree with the primary reason for withdrawal of consent for several subjects.</p><p>Review of comments on withdrawal shows 18 subjects with lack of efficacy, 10 additional subjects with AEs, and 6 subjects with exclusionary criteria including 3 with low BMD. Recalculation of the percentages for withdrawal of consent leads to more similar incidences across treatment arms -6.9%, 7.2%, and 6.0% for placebo, 150 mg QD, and 200 mg BID respectively. Lack of efficacy was reported for 3.2%, 1.6%, and 0.8% of subjects in the placebo, 150 mg QD and 200 mg BID treatment arms, respectively. Early withdrawal due to an AE was highest in the 200 mg BID arm while lack of efficacy was highest in the placebo arm. The placebo arm had the highest incidence of intervention for endometriosis treatment and pregnancies although event rates were low.</p><p>We do not agree with the primary reason for withdrawal for several subjects. Eight subjects with the reasons "other" and "noncompliant" had comments consistent with withdrawn consent. Five (5) subjects whose withdrawal was attributed to withdrawn consent or noncompliance also had an AE; their premature termination should have been categorized as withdrawal due to AEs. These differences increased the proportions of subjects withdrawn due to AEs to 6.3%, 4.0%, 9.6% for placebo, 150 mg QD, and 200 mg BID, respectively. Conversely, the proportion of subjects in each arm with noncompliance and "other" decreased. Withdrawn consent showed minimal change in all three arms.</p><p>At the end of the treatment period, subjects could enroll in a 6-month extension study unless they did not complete the treatment period, declined participation or had an exclusionary criterion emerge during treatment. In Study 665, approximately 10% of subjects in the placebo and 200 mg BID arms and 14% of subjects in the 150 mg QD arm declined participation in the extension study. In Study 671, 11% of all arms declined participation in the extension study.</p><p>Reasons for ineligibility to enroll in the two extension studies due to DXA and transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) findings are shown below. Subjects with BMD decrease ≥ 8% at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip were not eligible to enter the extension studies. Subjects with TVU findings of persistent simple ovarian cyst (&gt; 5 cm) or complex ovarian cyst (&gt; 3 cm) on repeat TVU at 2-6 weeks were also not eligible to enter extension studies.</p><p>In Study 671, the subjects' most common medical conditions were seasonal allergy (20%), depression (17%), skin/dermatological disorder (16%), migraine (15%), anxiety (14%), drug allergies/reactions (14%), asthma (12%), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (10%). Again, over 50% of the subjects had a history of at least one pregnancy prior to enrollment. All subjects were required to have had a surgical diagnosis of endometriosis. Seventy-four subjects (9.1%) had missing or unknown location of endometrioric lesions, and 70% had endometriotic lesions noted on the peritoneum at time of surgery. The length of time since surgical diagnosis of endometriosis ranged from 2.3 months to 25 years, the placebo arm having the longest length of time (25 years).</p><p>Note that the inclusion criterion specified subjects to have a clinical diagnosis of endometriosis established by documented surgical visualization performed within 10 years of study entry. Some subjects may have had more than one surgery over several years.</p><p>Prior medical treatment of endometriosis within each study's arms were similar and, other than the use of leuprolide, the two studies have similar patterns of medication use. Almost 90% of the subjects had a previous medical treatment, with 50% using combined hormonal contraceptives, 35% using propionic acid derivatives, and 25-30% using analgesics (including opioids). In Study 665, 29% of subjects had used leuprolide while only 17% of the subjects in Study 671 used leuprolide. The difference in leuprolide treatment between the studies suggests geographic differences in the treatment of endometriosis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol Violations</head><p>In Study 665, there were 243 deviations, involving approximately 28% of subjects. Deviations involved subjects entering the study but not satisfying entry criteria, developing withdrawal criteria but not being withdrawn, receiving wrong treatment or incorrect dose, and receiving excluded concomitant treatment. Deviations due to inclusion/exclusion criteria included surgical diagnosis within 10 years (prior to a protocol amendment changing this criterion from within 5 years of surgical diagnosis), length of menstrual cycles, pain criteria based on CPSSS, e-Dairy pain scores, presence of psychiatric disorders, and low BMD or metabolic bone disease. There were 12 subjects who were enrolled despite having low BMD or metabolic bone disease. Seven of the 12 did not satisfy the Z-score criteria (2 in the 150 mg QD arm, 5 in the 200 mg BID arm), two of whom had exclusionary Z-scores from the central imaging core laboratory but were approved for enrollment by AbbVie based on their local imaging results. Five subjects with exclusionary Z-score criteria received the study drug for only a few days before the results were known. One subject completed the study before it was noted that the screening DXA result was not available. One hundred and eighty-three subjects (21.0%) received a prohibited concomitant treatment during the study (screening, treatment, and PTFU). A subject's continued participation in the study upon use of a prohibited medication for an AE or a preexistent condition other than endometriosis was evaluated by the investigator and the AbbVie medical monitor. Seventy-seven subjects (8.8%) used a prohibited analgesic for nonendometriosis pain. Although, the withdrawal criteria include removal of subjects who required use of an exclusionary medication for endometriosis, 52 subjects (6.0%) used prohibited analgesics for EAP, and 62 (7.1%) subjects used prohibited corticosteroid. Overall 25 subjects (2.9%) used pain medication for ≥ 30 days. There were also 322 "other" study deviations from protocol compliance. Most of the deviations involved extended time for screening and randomization. There were 14 subjects who received the wrong dose of rescue medication and 8 reported use of the rescue medication for ≥ 30 days.</p><p>In Study 671, there were 207 deviations involving approximately 25% of subjects. Deviations due to inclusion/exclusion criteria included surgical diagnosis within 10 years (prior to a protocol amendment permitting a remote history of surgical diagnosis), length of menstrual cycles, pain criteria based on CPSSS, e-Dairy pain scores, baseline assessment of EAP, timing and type of surgery prior to randomization, and participation in another investigational study. There were 35 subjects (4.3%) who had no analysis of baseline EAP when inclusion criteria specified subjects to have moderate or severe pain for DYS and NMPP. Two subjects with exclusionary Z-score criteria were enrolled and received study drug for only a few days with both discontinued from the study within three days. One hundred and four subjects (12.8%) received a prohibited concomitant treatment during the study (screening, treatment, and PTFU). A subject's continued participation in the study upon use of a prohibited medication for an AE or a preexistent condition other than endometriosis was evaluated by the investigator and the AbbVie medical monitor. Forty-one (5.0%) subjects used a prohibited analgesic for non-endometriosis pain. Although, the withdrawal criteria include removal of subjects who required use of an exclusionary medication for endometriosis, 34 subjects (4.2%) used prohibited analgesics for EAP and 21 subjects (2.6%) used prohibited corticosteroid. Overall 35 subjects (4.3%) used pain medication for ≥ 30 days. There were also 369 "other" study deviations from protocol compliance. Most of the deviations involved extended time for screening or randomization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment Compliance</head><p>Study drug compliance was defined as the total number of tablets taken divided by the total number of tablets a subject was supposed to take each day times the length of time that the subject was in the treatment period of the study. The number of tablets taken was defined as the difference between the total number of tablets dispensed and the total number of tablets returned. If a subject did not return a kit, the site recorded that zero pills were returned and assumed that the subject took the entire amount of study drug for that time period.</p><p>In study 665, the treatment compliance was &gt; 95% in all three arms. In study 671, the treatment compliance was &gt; 91% in all three arms.</p><p>A &gt; 90% compliance rate in a BID regimen for 6 months seems unusually high. Compliance was confirmed at the study sites. It is unknown how many kits were not returned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concomitant Medications</head><p>In Study 665, most subjects (73.4 to 92.0%) took one or more concomitant medications. Medications of interest are noted in the table below segregated by the study period. Concomitant analgesic medications included all analgesic medications except protocol-specific analgesic medications taken for EAP and included treatment for AEs or other conditions. For each study period, there were no significant differences between the 3 treatment groups. However, there were differences between the three study periods. Concomitant analgesic use increased during the treatment period and did not completely decrease in the posttreatment period to pretreatment levels. Use of calcium and Vitamin D increased from baseline in the treatment and posttreatment period. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use increased slightly from pretreatment to posttreatment periods. The increase in analgesic use in the treatment period, especially in the 150 mg QD group, is unexpected. Analgesics were taken for painful conditions not attributed to endometriosise.g., migraine, musculoskeletal pain. Calcium and Vitamin D supplementation was encouraged at all visits which explains the sustained increase in these medications. There was a small increase in combined hormonal contraceptive use in the posttreatment period because subjects could start these contraceptives 3 months into the posttreatment follow up period.</p><p>In Study 671, most subjects across treatment groups (50.7% to 99.1%) took one or more concomitant medications and the patterns of usage were similar to Study 665 and not shown in table form. Again, analgesic use was highest in the treatment period in all arms, slightly decreasing in the posttreatment period but not to pretreatment levels. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use increased over the three periods from 10.4% to 12.3% to 15.0%. Calcium and Vitamin D supplementation increased to &gt; 50% during the treatment period with a slight drop to &gt; 40% in the Post treatment period. Hormonal contraception increased to 8.5% in the posttreatment period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concomitant Analgesic Medication for EAP</head><p>Concomitant analgesic medication use for EAP was collected separately from concomitant analgesic medication use for non-EAP (above) and from rescue analgesic medication use for EAP (efficacy data).</p><p>In study 665, during both the pretreatment and treatment periods, less than 5% of subjects used any analgesic. In the posttreatment period, there was a small increase to 7% in the 150 mg QD and 200 mg BID arms compared to 5.1% in the placebo arm. The numbers of subjects were small (each arm seven to eight subjects). The Applicant notes that only two of the subjects used opioids repeatedly and most used the analgesics for "short-term."</p><p>In Study 671, the overall use of concomitant analgesic medication for EAP during the pretreatment, treatment, and posttreatment periods were 4.7% to 6.9% to 8.2%, respectively. The placebo group had more analgesic use than either of the active treatment groups during the pretreatment and treatment periods. However, the active treatment groups had more analgesic use than the placebo group in the posttreatment period. Again, the number of subjects in the posttreatment period is small (10 or few subjects per arm). The Applicant notes that only six subjects had repeated opioid use and most were for "short-term" use.</p><p>There does not appear to be a clear relationship between treatment with elagolix and use of concomitant analgesic medication for EAP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Results -Co-Primary Endpoints</head><p>The coprimary endpoints for both studies were the proportion of responders at month 3 for daily assessment of DYS and the proportion of responders at month 3 for daily assessment of About 25% of subjects prematurely withdrew from the placebo-controlled trials. Sensitivity analyses of the co-primary efficacy endpoints using only observed data (i.e. without data imputation for missing values), and sensitivity analyses that treated all premature discontinuations as non-responders showed that the responder rate difference between each elagolix dose versus placebo was similar to that of the primary analysis. This suggests that the missing data due to premature discontinuation did not impact the efficacy conclusions with respect to the co-primary endpoints.</p><p>FDA also conducted a sensitivity analysis of the DYS responder rates at month 3 excluding subjects with amenorrhea, which showed that the responder rates were very close to the rates obtained in the primary analysis. This suggests that absence of menses is not the reason for response to treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Results -Secondary and Other Relevant Endpoints</head><p>The results of the secondary endpoints for both studies are shown in the two tables below. The 150 mg QD arms showed statistically significant reduction from baseline in the NRS pain score at month 3 and in the DYS and NMPP pain scores at month 6 compared to placebo. The 200 mg BID arms showed statistically significant reduction in the above three endpoints as well as reduction of analgesic use at months 3 and 6, reduction in DYSP at month 3, and reduction of opioid use at month 3 compared to placebo. Analgesic use was based on pill counts of each type of analgesic (NSAID and opioids). As explained below, while the reductions in opioid use were statistically significant, the clinical relevance of those findings have not been demonstrated.</p><p>each country. The fourth, fifth, and seventh-ranked secondary endpoints involved the change in analgesic use from baseline compared to the placebo group. In both studies, the 200 mg BID arms showed a statistically significant decrease in rescue analgesic use compared to the placebo group but the 150 mg QD arms did not show statistically significantly decrease.</p><p>Consultation with the Division of Anesthesia, Analgesia, and Addiction Products (DAAAP) further elucidated the change in analgesic use. The absolute difference in the average pill count for both classes of analgesics was approximately 0.5 pills/day and for opioids 0.21 pills per day. 5 Further, when the average daily opioid use was converted to morphine equivalents, the resultant decrease was only one morphine equivalent per day. The Applicant has not shown this amount of decrease to be clinically meaningful.</p><p>Therefore, although the 200 mg BID dose of elagolix showed a statistically significant decrease in analgesic pill use, this decrease has not been shown to be clinically meaningful.</p><p>The Division encouraged the Applicant on numerous occasions to rank DYSP higher in the list of prespecified secondary endpoints and recommended showing improvement of dyspareunia to month 6. The Applicant chose to rank DYSP at month 3 towards the bottom of the list of prespecified secondary endpoints and did not include DYSP at month 6 in the ranking. The 150 mg QD dose was not tested for dyspareunia because hierarchical testing for that dose had stopped when an earlier secondary endpoint failed. The 200 mg BID dose showed statistically significantly less dyspareunia at month 3 compared to placebo in both trials.</p><p>Labeling should state that both doses of elagolix are effective for moderate-severe DYS and NMPP and be clear that only the 200 mg BID dose showed efficacy for DYSP and only at month 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Narcotic Use</head><p>A statistically significant change from baseline to month 3 in the use of narcotics based on pill count (7 th ranked secondary endpoint) was observed in both trials for elagolix 200 mg BID relative to placebo. No significant reduction in the use of narcotic class of medication based on pill count was seen for elagolix 150 mg QD.</p><p>The Division requested additional analysis of reduction in opioid use using CDFs and sought input from the Division of Anesthesia, Analgesia, and Addiction Products (DAAAP) to assess the clinical meaningfulness of these results. The CDFs for month 3 are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 12</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 13</ref> below; the curves for month 6 are similar and are not shown.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Analyses Conducted for Each Trial</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subgroup Analyses for the Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoints</head><p>The sponsor pre-defined subgroup analyses for the co-primary efficacy endpoints. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 52</ref> to <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 55</ref>, the responder rates of DYS and of NMPP were generally consistently The CDFs for changes from baseline in DYS and NMPP by PGIC categories were also explored by pooling all subjects across treatment groups in the MITT population. Each CDF shows a continuous plot of the proportion of subjects at each point along the scale score continuum who experience reduction in pain at that level or greater. In the context of the responder assessment, the y-axis represents the proportion of subjects who are considered responders at that threshold value on the x-axis.</p><p>By visual examination of the CDF plots ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 14</ref> to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 17</ref>), there is consistent separation between the patients who were "very much improved" or "much improved" on the PGIC compared to the other PGIC categories for both DYS and NMPP at month 3, except for some overlap between "much improved" and "very much worse" for NMPP at month 3 in Study 665. Therefore, grouping the "very much improved" and "much improved" categories in the ROC analysis was appropriate. There were three Phase 2 dose-finding studies that utilized the IR formulation of elagolix. The 200 mg BID dose was not studied in these Phase 2 studies.</p><p>Study NBI-56418-0702 was a randomized, double-blind trial that compared elagolix 150 mg QD or 250 mg QD to placebo for 12 weeks, followed by randomization of the placebo group to one of the active treatment arms for an additional 12 weeks. The endpoint was the change from baseline in the monthly mean NRS (assessed daily) for endometriosis pain at week 12. The decreases from baseline in the 150 mg QD and 250 mg QD arms were greater compared to the decrease from baseline in the placebo group but the differences were not statistically significant. BMD as measured by DXA showed small decreases from baseline at week 24 with a larger decrease observed in the 250 mg group compared to the 150 mg group.</p><p>Study NBI-56418-0703 replicated Study 0702 and added a fourth arm of intramuscular leuprolide 3.75 mg monthly for 12 weeks followed by randomization of the placebo and leuprolide arms to either elagolix 150 mg QD or 250 mg QD for an additional 12 weeks. There was a follow up visit 6 weeks after elagolix was discontinued for a total study duration of 30 weeks. There was no primary efficacy endpoint. Key endpoints included the change from baseline in the monthly mean NRS for endometriosis pain at week 12, the change from baseline in monthly mean DYS and NMPP (using daily assessment with a 4-point pain impact scale) at week 12, and percentage of days with prescription analgesic use. At the end of week 12, the differences in the monthly mean NRS between the active treatment groups and placebo were not statistically significant. Decreases in monthly mean DYS in the three active treatment arms appeared to be larger than those observed in the placebo arm. There were no statistically significant decreases in the monthly mean NMPP score of either elagolix arms at week 12 compared with the placebo arm. However, the monthly mean NMPP score for the leuprolide arm appeared to decrease compared with placebo at week 12. Analgesic use showed little change overall in all study groups. BMD showed the largest decrease at week 12 in the leuprolide group. Mean decreases in BMD were slightly greater at week 24 than week 12 in the elagolix groups with the 250 mg QD group having a slightly greater decrease in BMD than the 150 mg QD group at both time points.</p><p>Study NBI-5648-0901 was a randomized, double-blind trial comparing elagolix 150 mg QD and placebo for 8 weeks, followed by an open-label phase where all subjects received elagolix 150 mg QD for an additional 16 weeks. There was a follow up visit at week 30, six weeks after the last dose of study drug was administered. There were numerous efficacy endpoints including changes in monthly mean scores from baseline in DYS, NMPP, DYSP, and analgesic use for endometriosis pain compared with placebo. PGIC scores and percentages of responders compared to baseline for DYS, NMPP, and DYSP were also evaluated. At the end of the 8-week placebo-controlled study, there was a numerically larger decrease in DYS, NMPP, and DYSP from baseline in the elagolix group compared to placebo. Use of any analgesics and prescription analgesics appeared to show a larger decrease from baseline in the elagolix group compared to placebo with the use of narcotic analgesics compared to placebo showing a similar trend. PGIC scores appeared to be lower for the elagolix group compared to placebo at week 8 (lower value = more improvement). A higher percentage of elagolix-treated subjects (60.3%) reported being much improved and very much improved than placebo subjects (30.2%). The percentage of responders for DYS, NMPP, and DYSP appeared to be higher for the elagolix group compared to the placebo group at most responder thresholds. BMD was not evaluated in this study.</p><p>Dose finding in these phase 2 trials are limited. Only two doses, 150 mg QD and 250 mg QD were evaluated. Studies 702 and 703 did not show significant changes in efficacy for both DYS and NMPP over placebo for either 150 mg QD or 250 mg QD of elagolix, but did show greater BMD loss with the higher dose of elagolix. In Study 901, elagolix 150 mg QD appear to have efficacy over placebo (elagolix 250 mg QD was not studied). The reason for the different results might be related to the baseline pain scores. In Studies 702 and 703, the mean baseline pain scores corresponded to mild pain intensity while in Study 901 the mean baseline pain scores corresponded to moderate-severe pain intensity. Efficacy in the Phase 3 trials was established only in patients with moderate to severe EAP, which will be reflected in the indication. The label will mention the Phase 3 trial inclusion criteria used to enroll patients with moderate to severe EAP to help guide clinical use.</p><p>There were no efficacy trials utilizing BID dosing of the IR formulation of elagolix for EAP. The Applicant notes that Phase 1 PK studies suggested increased hormonal suppression with higher doses and BID regimens and this was the rationale for studying the 200 mg BID regimen in Phase 3.</p><p>There were no efficacy trials that titrated the elagolix dose in subjects who had not responded to lower elagolix doses. Therefore, it is unclear if increasing the dose of elagolix in nonresponders will result in responder status.</p><p>The Applicant has proposed that the starting dose be based on the severity of symptoms and treatment objectives with the lowest effective dose being utilized. When the predominant symptom is dyspareunia, the Applicant proposes consideration to start with the 200 mg BID dose. This latter recommendation acknowledges that the 150 mg QD dose of elagolix did not show efficacy for DYSP. This proposed dosing appears reasonable. There is no recommended approach to dose titration from 150 mg QD to 200 mg BID.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.4.">Assessment of Efficacy Across Trials</head><p>The two placebo-controlled Phase 3 trials -Studies 665 and 671, had virtually identical designs. Study 665 was conducted entirely in the U.S. and Canada while Study 671 enrolled patients across different continents (U.S., Europe, South America, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa). Results were consistent across these two adequate and well-controlled trials, providing replicative evidence of efficacy.</p><p>In early clinical development, statistically significant treatment effects were not consistently observed in Phase 2 trials (enrollment in two of those trials was open to patients with mild EAP). The two Phase 3 trials were enriched to include only women with moderate to severe EAP. Therefore, treatment benefit should not be extrapolated to women with only mild EAP. The Applicant has agreed to limit the target population to women with moderate to severe EAP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.5.">Integrated Review of Effectiveness</head><p>As noted previously, other than enrolling subjects from different regions of the world, the two six-month Phase 3 trials had virtually identical designs. Results from these trials were highly consistent and clearly demonstrated that both the 150 mg QD and 200 mg BID regimens resulted in improvement in DYS and NMPP in women with moderate to severe EAP. In both trials, the 200 mg BID dose resulted in less dyspareunia than placebo at month 3, the only timepoint included for this endpoint in the hierarchical statistical testing strategy. In both trials, the 200 mg BID dose resulted in statistically significantly less opioid use by pill count than placebo but the absolute decrease (1 morphine milligram equivalent) is not adequate to demonstrate clinically meaningfulness. The highly consistent results across the two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 trials clearly establish substantial evidence of effectiveness for elagolix as a treatment of moderate to severe EAP.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.1.">Safety Review Approach</head><p>The review of safety for this submission focused on the Phase 3, placebo-controlled, six-month endometriosis Studies M12-665 and M12-671. Long-term supportive safety data were submitted from Phase 3 extension studies M12-667 and M12-821, which provided an additional 6 months of data. Additional supportive data were derived from 6 Phase 2 studies, 13 multipledose Phase 1 studies, the 120-day safety update to the NDA, and other ongoing trials for this product that are being studied in women with fibroids. This product has not been previously approved in any other country.</p><p>The major safety findings that were anticipated based on elagolix's mechanism of action are those related to its activity in lowering estrogen and progesterone, including bone loss and vasomotor symptoms. There was also a focus on depression and other mood disorders for this centrally acting drug product. We also considered the adverse reactions associated with the study drug that occurred in the fibroid clinical program.</p><p>NDA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 210450} {Orilissa and elagolix sodium} 131 her liver tests partially normalized. A number of Information Requests relating to this case were sent. Given an imbalance in liver tests between the elagolix-treated group and placebo group already identified, the Division consulted the Division of Gastroenterology and Inborn Errors Products (DGIEP) and a hepatologist with expertise in drug-induced liver injury in the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology. In response to the Agency's request, the Applicant sought medical records from the investigator in , ultimately providing documents (original and translated into English) to substantiate a diagnosis of hepatitis A. At the late-cycle meeting with FDA, the Applicant acknowledged insufficient oversight and inadequate real-time safety monitoring for this hepatitis A case; the Applicant further volunteered that this case resulted from alterations in their internal processes. As a result of these activities and delay in receiving information, the review clock was extended by 3 months to allow FDA sufficient time to fully review a major amendment related to liver safety across the development program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Categorization of Adverse Events</head><p>Other than the hepatitis A case, the Applicant's categorization of adverse events is generally acceptable. The definitions of adverse events, serious adverse events and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) were acceptable. The TEAE events were defined to extend for 30 days post treatment. The Phase 3 controlled and extension studies were uniformly coded using MedDRA version 19.1. There was adequate hierarchy in the JMP database to assess adverse events. The preferred terms were used most often but the verbatim terms helped to analyze the drug-induced rash cases to a better extent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Routine Clinical Tests</head><p>Clinical safety laboratory testing was performed centrally at screening, day 1 and then monthly throughout the 6-month pivotal studies. Monthly pregnancy testing and endocrine laboratory assessments were also performed. Exploratory bone biomarkers were evaluated at day 1, month 3 and month 6.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary Statement Regarding Serious Adverse Events</head><p>Most of the serious adverse events reported in the clinical study were deemed to be unrelated to elagolix. One area of concern was related to psychiatric disorders. Reports of suicidal ideation, depression and anxiety were among the serious adverse events (SAEs) reported. Additionally, findings from common adverse events show an increased incidence in elagolixtreated subjects compared to placebo for these and similar events. Labeling will address these concerns.</p><p>Many of the SAEs of endometriosis, abdominal pain and pelvic pain relate to the subject's underlying endometriotic condition and the fact that elagolix is not always efficacious.</p><p>Phase 1 Studies -SAEs There were seven serious adverse events reported in Phase 1 studies in subjects taking elagolix. These included:</p><p> Pelvic abscess <ref type="formula">(1)</ref>  Notable narrative information regarding the above SAEs includes the following:</p><p> The pelvic abscess symptoms manifested themselves in a 26-year-old subject (Subject ) 3 days after a single dose of elagolix 25 mg. Abscess material obtained at laparoscopy grew Fusobacterium and Prevotella. Relevant medical history included an in situ intrauterine device. A relationship between the single dose elagolix administration and the pelvic abscess is unlikely.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Reference ID: 4295479 (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6)</formula><p> Subject who developed cholecystitis and an abdominal abscess was 40 years old and took elagolix 200 mg BID for 82 days. Sixteen days after her last treatment she developed epigastric/right upper quadrant pain, nausea and vomiting. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and cholangiogram, showing common bile duct obstruction from gallstones. Postoperative complications included pancreatitis secondary to cystic duct obstruction, abdominal abscess and pleural effusion. Some literature suggests increased levels of estrogen and progestins in association with gall bladder and bile duct disease but elagolix typically lowers ovarian hormones; therefore, gallstones are the most likely cause of this subject's symptoms and complications.</p><p> The 27-year-old subject (Subject ) with the ectopic pregnancy completed her elagolix (300 mg BID) on study day 82. Her pregnancy test results were not positive until study day 143. The ectopic pregnancy was treated surgically and unlikely to be related to treatment with elagolix.</p><p> The premature delivery and neonatal death occurred in a 21-year-old subject (Subject ) who took two doses of elagolix in the QT study (300 mg on day 1, 1200 mg on day 8). The subject's estimated conception date by sonography was 38 days after her last dose of elagolix on day 8. The subject had premature rupture of membranes and premature labor at 23 weeks. The infant expired 1 hour following vaginal delivery. We find no association with the pregnancy complications and elagolix administration.</p></div>

There were 18 subjects with 19 SAEs in subjects taking elagolix. There were 6 SAEs reported for other active comparators and 4 SAEs reported for subjects taking placebo.</p><p>The 19 SAEs for subjects taking elagolix included:</p><p> Appendicitis (1) = Subject in Study NBI-56418-0703  Anaphylactoid reaction (1) = Subject in Study NBI-56418-0501 (see the narrative for this subject in the discussion of anaphylactoid and drug-induced rashes in section 8.2.5.3 of this review)  Abortion spontaneous <ref type="formula">(2)</ref>  Reference ID: 4295479 <ref type="formula">(6)</ref>  Ovarian dysgerminoma <ref type="formula">(1)</ref>  Notable narrative information regarding the above SAEs includes the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">(b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b)</formula><p> Pregnancy results (including spontaneous abortions) will be discussed in section 8.2.5.</p><p> Subject was a 33-year-old-female who presented with right lower quadrant pain. She underwent surgery for an incarcerated incisional hernia. Evidence of periappendicitis and a ruptured ovarian cyst were also found. She resumed her elagolix study drug after the hospitalization. This event does not appear to be drug-related.</p><p> Subject (bipolar disorder) and subject (depression suicidal) are discussed in section 8.2.5.</p><p> Subject was a 33-year-old female who presented to an emergency room with gallbladder symptoms approximately 21 days after starting study drug (elagolix 150 mg QD). She had previously seen her physician for xiphoid and substernal pain prior to starting study drug and at which time the gallstones were diagnosed by ultrasound. The subject underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Study drug was restarted after the hospitalization. The SAE narrative reported that the subject also developed dehydration 7 weeks after starting study drug. The case report form noted the adverse events of nausea, vomiting, and refractory diarrhea at the same time point as the hospitalization for dehydration. A stool sample was negative for WBCs, erythrocytes, and ova and parasites. No salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, or E. coli were found. The only gastrointestinal finding was a tubulovillous polyp that was removed at colonoscopy. The case report form also noted some intermittent diarrhea 2 months later in but no additional information. Study drug was not interrupted during the dehydration episode. It is unlikely that either SAE was associated with elagolix.</p><p> Subject was a 21-year-old female who was treated for dehydration that was felt to be secondary to food poisoning.</p><p> Subject was a 36-year-old who completed her 12-week treatment phase (elagolix 100 mg BID) but experienced a worsening of her endometriosis 27 days after her last dose of study drug.

Six days before her hospitalization, she received a botulinum injection for prophylactic migraine treatment. Later that day she had a migraine. Her migraine subsided during the hospitalization and she completed the study without interruption of study drug. Although the investigator judged the event to be unlikely related to study drug, it is not possible to definitively rule out hormonal shift factors and an associative role for elagolix.</p><p> Subject was a 22-year-old female who was diagnosed with an ovarian dysgerminoma on day 218 after starting study drug (elagolix 150 mg QD) and 43 days after taking the last dose. The subject was treated with surgery and chemotherapy. Ovarian dysgerminomas have not been associated with hormonal treatment and we find no association with elagolix.</p><p> Subject was a 29-year-old female who was randomized to receive elagolix 150 mg QD for 24 weeks. She was hospitalized approximately 3 months after her final dose of study drug for pelvic pain. A diagnostic laparoscopy was performed and numerous filmy adhesions were lysed. The pelvic pain resolved after surgery. We find no association with elagolix.</p><p> Subject was a 40-year-old female who was randomized to receive elagolix 150 mg QD for 24 weeks. This subject was relatively pain free during treatment but had pelvic pain 3 days after her last dose of study drug. She was hospitalized and underwent a laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy. We find no association with elagolix.</p><p> Subject was a 39-year-old female who was randomized to receive elagolix 75 mg BID for 24 weeks. On study day 174 the subject experienced pneumonia approximately 7 days after her last oral dose of study drug. She was hospitalized for 7 days with resolution of her pneumonia.

She was on placebo in Study M12-665 and then switched to elagolix 150 mg/day in extension Study M12-667. On day 116 in the extension study the subject was found to have a lung tumor. On day 179 (post-treatment day 25) she underwent a left thoracoscopy with wedge resection and left upper lobectomy. The pathology revealed grade 3 adenocarcinoma. Her study drug was not interrupted and her last scheduled dose was on day 154. Following the study (day 364), the subject also suffered a cerebrovascular accident. Even though lung adenocarcinomas have been identified with hormone receptors, an association between elagolix and cancer is unlikely. Elagolix lowers hormones which should lessen any impact that tumor hormone receptors may play in tumor progression. Her heavy smoking is the most likely cause of her lung cancer.</p><p> Of the 10 subjects with endometriosis listed as SAEs, all had worsening of their disease.</p><p>Surgical therapy was performed on 5 of the subjects. Conservative and/or medical therapy was used for the remainder.</p><p> Of the nine subjects with SAEs of pelvic pain, seven were thought by investigators to be related to endometriosis. Subject was thought to have pelvic pain secondary to a urinary tract infection. Subject developed pelvic pain post study and this was thought to be related to an ovarian cyst. We concur with the investigators' assessments.</p><p> Subject was a 24-year-old female with a prior history of supraventricular tachycardia. During her enrollment in Study M12-665, she took placebo. During this extension study, she developed anxiety while treated with elagolix 150 mg daily. On day 2 of the extension study she went to the emergency room with tachycardia, chest pain, shortness of breath and numbness in her fingers. The study drug was discontinued. Both the Investigator and the Applicant considered the event of supraventricular tachycardia as having a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. The relevance to study drug is unclear as this subject had a history of supraventricular tachycardia before receiving study drug.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations Regarding Postmarketing Surveillance The consult recommendations are listed verbatim:</head><p> "To gain important information on the hepatotoxic risk profile of elagolix, the Applicant should institute an enhanced pharmacovigilance program. Health care providers should be encouraged to report all cases of serious liver injury to the Applicant with sufficient information to assess causality. The Applicant should actively follow-up on these cases and provide FDA with 15-day expedited reports for all serious liver injury cases in all post-market patients and ongoing clinical trial study subjects in addition to follow-up clinical and diagnostic information that will facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of causality and severity. In the Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Reports to FDA, the Applicant should analyze the incidence and range of severity of liver toxicity, describe all individual cases of serious liver injury, and provide estimates of the numbers of elagolix treated patients in the U.S. market and globally if indicated."</p><p>The Division concurs with the consult findings and recommendations regarding potential liver injury signals.</p><p>In collaboration with the Division of Pharmacovigilance II in OSE, the Division will request that the Applicant implement an enhanced pharmacovigilance plan for postmarketing surveillance.

See <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 72</ref>. However, the EHP-30 was not considered to be validated for this development program or intended for labeling considerations. The effect on emotional well-being is tempered both by results in another patient reported outcome (the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire; EQ-5D-5L) and also by the safety findings in the placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies (Studies 665 and 671). In <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 73</ref>, from EQ-5D-5L, there appears to be very little change in the final two responses (severely anxious or depressed; extremely anxious or depressed) from baseline to month 6.

She then rolled-over into Study M12-667 and continued to receive elagolix 150 mg QD. On day 29 of the extension study, the subject (age 29 at time of the events) experienced severe premenstrual dysphoric disorder and severe suicidal ideation. The subject reported suicidal ideation with a plan to cut her wrists for three days prior to menses during the previous 2 months. The subject denied relationship or situational issues or stressors. The subject denied any plan to act on the suicidal thoughts. The subject declined a psychiatric consult; therefore, she was not evaluated by a mental health provider for the events. The subject was treated with fluoxetine and study drug was not interrupted due to these events. The events were characterized as intermittent and were considered resolved on day 50. Both the Investigator and Sponsor considered the events of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and suicidal ideation as having a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug.</p></div>

The percentages of hot flushes graded in the severe category (6.5%) and the percentage of subjects prematurely discontinuing study drug (1.7%) have also been previously described in this review.</p><p>We performed an analysis of insomnia from the PA2 adverse event analysis dataset which is found in section 5.3.5.3 of the submission (this includes adverse events from all the Phase 3 trials -Studies 665, 667, 671 and 821). Of 69 subjects with a report of insomnia, 45 subjects also had reports of hot flushes. There were 24 subjects with reports of insomnia without hot flushes. Of these 24 subjects, 33% were taking placebo, 13 (54.0 %) were taking the 150 mg QD dose and 3 (12.5%) were taking the 200 mg BID dose. These percentages seem appropriate.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.5.4.">Pregnancies</head><p>As noted previously, the Applicant assessed elagolix in a folliculogenesis and ovulation study (M12-673). For elagolix 150 mg QD, the ovulation rate was approximately 50% over the 3-cycle study. For elagolix 200 mg BID, the ovulation rate was 32%. These data indicate that elagolix does not suppress ovulation to a degree consistent with hormonal contraceptives.</p><p>Additionally, based on the mechanism of action, there is a theoretical risk that elagolix may cause a decrease in luteal progesterone production in early pregnancy and may be associated with potential increased risk of pregnancy complications, such as early pregnancy loss. A posthoc analysis was performed by the Applicant on serum progesterone concentrations measured during the luteal phase in the women who ovulated during elagolix treatment in Study M12-673. Overall the luteal serum progesterone in ovulating women during the elagolix treatment cycles is approximately 25% lower than the luteal phase progesterone concentrations measured during the untreated Screening period. The progesterone decreases based on dose are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_19">Table 81</ref> below.</p><p>Reference ID: 4295479 (b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(6)</ref>   <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>, Technical Summary of Pregnancy, page 13 of 306 BID = twice daily, QD = once daily, SD = standard deviation Serum progesterone measurements vary through the cycle and certainly between subjects. It is unclear why there would be an increase in serum progesterone with the 100 mg QD dose but the 150 mg QD dose shows a greater decrease than the 200 mg BID dose. In this case, it is important to look at the pregnancy results in the clinical trials to judge whether progesterone decreases in this range will significantly affect pregnancies. Placental hormonal support (human chorionic gonadotropin, human placental lactogen, estrogen and progesterone) of pregnancy increases rapidly in the first trimester and might offset the effect of decreases in serum progesterone.</p><p>Overall Pregnancy Outcomes As of 19 June 2017, 69 on-treatment pregnancies have been reported among women enrolled in elagolix clinical trials who received either elagolix or placebo (one additional pregnancy was reported in a subject who received oral contraceptives). On-treatment pregnancies are defined as those that had a conception date during the treatment period with study drug dosing or were deemed to have a conception date within 30 days after the last dose of study drug.</p><p>Among the 69 on-treatment pregnancies, 10 occurred in healthy female volunteers, 57 in women with endometriosis, and 2 pregnancies in women with uterine fibroids. Twenty of the 69 pregnancies occurred in women treated with placebo and 49 pregnancies occurred in women who received elagolix. The annualized on-treatment pregnancy rates among subjects with up to 12 months of treatment exposure in the elagolix Phase 3 endometriosis clinical development program were 4.81% for placebo, 4.07% for elagolix 150 mg QD, and 2.66% for elagolix 200 mg BID.</p></div>

She was initially diagnosed with having an ectopic pregnancy and treated with intramuscular methotrexate. Subsequently it was determined that there was an intrauterine pregnancy (tiny yolk sac) and the adnexal mass most likely represented a hemorrhagic corpus luteum.

The subject had preeclampsia during delivery and was discharged three days after delivery. The subject was noted to have postpartum depression.</p><p>The infant's Apgar scores were 7 at 1 minute, 9 at 5 minutes, and 9 at 10 minutes. Her vital signs were stable and blood glucose was above 80. The infant's measurements were: weight, 5 pounds 12 ounces; length, 18.70 inches; head circumference, 13.39 inches; and chest circumference, 12.01 inches. Nuchal cord x2 was found at delivery and reduced. The infant had some signs of distress at birth (episode of being dusky) which responded to simple oxygen.</p><p>Approximately 12 hours after birth, during a feeding attempt, the infant vomited and had a choking episode associated with oxygen desaturations. The infant was diagnosed with type C trachea-oesophageal fistula.</p><p>Approximately 1 day after birth, an echocardiogram indicated that the infant had patent ductus arteriosus (measuring 0.163 cm) with a small left-to-right shunt and trace tricuspid valve insufficiency with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 37 mm Hg.</p><p>Reference ID: 4295479</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">(b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (4)</formula><p>Due to the small size of the patent ductus arteriosus and based on the infant's growth, the neonatal intensive care unit physician indicated that the patent ductus arteriosus would seal itself and once it seals, the trace tricuspid value would self-correct.</p><p>Approximately 2 days after birth, the infant had surgery to repair the tracheo-esophageal fistula. The infant tolerated the procedure well and remained intubated. Approximately 4 days after birth, the chest x-ray showed development of extensive left-sided atelectasis resulting in ipsilateral mediastinal shift. Approximately 5 days after birth, a chest x-ray showed development of right pneumothorax. It was thought that the pneumothorax was due to a tiny leak at the site of surgical repair.

The subject completed Study M12-821 with the last scheduled dose administered on day 175.</p><p>On day 221 (post-elagolix treatment day 46), the subject had a positive urine pregnancy test and a positive qualitative serum pregnancy test. On the same day, an ultrasound performed revealed a gestational age of 5 weeks. A subsequent second trimester ultrasound was performed on day 345 (post-elagolix treatment day 170) and revealed a gestational age of 23 weeks. No fetal abnormalities were detected on either ultrasound.</p><p>The subject's pregnancy resulted in the birth of a live male infant on day 446 (post-elagolix treatment day 271). The infant was delivered by cesarean section, due to transverse position, at a gestational age of 37 weeks and 1 day; the infant weighed 3.3 kg, and measured 55 cm in length, with no reported abnormalities. The Apgar score was reported as 10. It was reported that there were no medically significant complications during the pregnancy, labor, or delivery period.</p><p>The investigator site became aware that a birth defect of non-syndromic craniosynostosis was detected on ultrasonography at age 3 months and on computed tomography scan at age 7 months. No genetic or metabolic tests were performed. The infant was evaluated by a neurosurgeon and scheduled for neurosurgical treatment to occur at the age of 14 months.</p><p>The site estimated no fetal exposure based on the first trimester ultrasound.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bone Mineral Density (BMD)</head><p>Elagolix reduces estrogen in a dose-dependent manner. Declines in estrogen levels are associated with an increase in bone resorption that may exceed bone formation and can result in bone loss. Therefore, elagolix may have a negative impact on bone health. Accordingly, changes in BMD during treatment as well as post-treatment were a safety endpoint of interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BMD Study Protocol</head><p>In the placebo-controlled pivotal trials M12-665 and M12-671, measurements of BMD were performed in all subjects at baseline and at month 6. Subjects who discontinued study drug prematurely were required to have a DXA scan at the Premature Discontinuation visit, unless they discontinued prior to month 3. The month 6 BMD assessment was obtained between study days 141 and 196, inclusive, and had to be no more than 28 days after the last dose of study drug; a minimum exposure to study drug of 140 days was also required. Therefore, subjects who discontinued study drug prematurely, but met the above month 6 BMD inclusion criteria, were included in the BMD analysis. Note that the inclusion of subjects with less than 6 months of elagolix exposure at the month 6 BMD analysis, may underestimate the decline in BMD on therapy. A repeat DXA scan was performed if the subject had ≥ 5% decline in BMD at the lumbar spine or total hip. The lower of the two measurements was used for analysis. A central imaging contractor ( for trials M12-665 and M12-667 and for trials M12-671 and M12-821) coordinated the longitudinal calibration of scanners and performed treatment-blinded readings. A correction factor, based on site-specific calibration data, was applied to all submitted BMD data. Subjects were counseled at every visit on the importance of taking calcium 500 to 1000 mg and vitamin D 400 IU daily.</p><p>The BMD exclusion criterion for participation in the extension trials was bone loss of ≥ 8% at any anatomic site during the pivotal trial. Subjects who did not enter the extension trials (e.g., those who discontinued investigational drug, declined participation, or did not qualify), entered the PTFU for up to 12 months.</p><p>DXA scans for BMD assessment were performed at month 6 of the extension trials according to the procedures described above for the pivotal trials. In addition, subjects who had ≥ 5% and &lt; 8% decline in BMD at any anatomic site after 6 months of treatment in the pivotal trials were required to have DXA scans in duplicate at month 3 of the extension trial and discontinue the study if they had a decline in BMD of ≥ 8% at any anatomic site. At the end of the 6-month extension trial treatment period, subjects entered the PTFU period as described below.</p><p>Reference ID: 4295479 (b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(6)</ref> (b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(6)</ref> Note that lack of a control arm during the extension study limits the interpretation of changes at one year of treatment since younger subjects (typically &lt; 30 years of age), who have not yet attained peak bone mass, would be expected to experience an increase in BMD over time.</p><p>Post-Treatment Follow Up Period: Subjects could enter the PTFU directly from the pivotal placebo-controlled Phase 3 trials or from their extension trials. For the pivotal trials and extension trial M12-667, subjects with bone loss of &gt; 1.5% at the spine and/or &gt; 2.5% at the total hip at month 6 of treatment who entered the PTFU period were required to have a DXA scan at PTFU month 6. In trial M12-821, all subjects were required to enter the PTFU period. DXA scans obtained between days 141 and 196 after the last dose of elagolix were included in the PTFU month 6 BMD analysis. After completing a minimum of 6 months in the PTFU period, a subject was considered to have completed the study if her menses had returned and she demonstrated adequate bone recovery, which was defined as ≤ 1.5% bone loss in the spine and ≤ 2.5% bone loss in the total hip compared with pretreatment baseline. All other subjects continued to return for visits through PTFU month 12, until return to menses and adequate bone recovery (if applicable) had been demonstrated. DXA scans were performed again at month 12. DXA scans obtained &gt; 308 days after the last dose of elagolix were included in the PTFU month 12 BMD analysis. Subjects who had ≥ 3% bone loss at any site at the end of the study (month 12 of the PTFU period) were to be referred to a bone specialist. Subjects were permitted to resume medications on the prohibited medication list (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_19">Table 88</ref>) after 3 months into the PTFU period. Most of these prohibited drugs that subjects could resume 3 months into the PTFU could impact BMD results. The Applicant was asked to also analyze the BMD data during the PTFU period excluding subjects who took medications that could impact BMD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjects:</head><p>Key exclusion criteria with respect to bone health included diagnosis of or treatment for osteoporosis, baseline DXA screening BMD Z-score ≤ -1.5 at any site [lumbar spine (L1-4), total hip or femoral neck], underlying conditions that would interfere with obtaining an adequate BMD measurement, underlying conditions associated with bone loss such as hyperparathyroidism, anorexia nervosa or glucocorticoid excess, known bone disease such as osteomalacia or osteogenesis imperfecta, low trauma spine or hip fracture, pathologic fracture, or disturbances in calcium or phosphate. Women who had a decline in BMD from baseline of ≥8% at any site were excluded from entering the extension trials. Declines in bone mineral density were most prominent at the spine, a site comprised of predominantly trabecular bone, and is consistent with bone loss associated with the decline in estrogen levels. Overall, in the 6-month placebo-controlled trials combined, subjects treated with elagolix 150 mg QD had a mean treatment difference at the lumbar spine of -1.07% (95% CI -1.41, -0.73) and subjects treated with elagolix 200 mg BID group had a mean treatment difference of -3.06% (95% CI -3.40, -2.72) (Source: ISS To evaluate the effects of elagolix on BMD for up to 12 months the results for each pivotal trial together with its corresponding extension study are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 93</ref>. Bone loss was not only related to dose, but also appeared to continue with increasing duration of use.  During the pivotal trials combined, a decline in BMD of &gt; 8% at any anatomic site occurred in 2 (0.4%) subjects in the placebo arm, 5 (1%) in the elagolix 150 mg QD arm and 24 (6%) in the elagolix 200 mg BID arm. During the extension studies combined, 12 (5%) additional patients receiving elagolix 150 mg QD and 51 (21%) additional patients receiving elagolix 200 mg BID had bone loss &gt; 8% at any site compared to pre-treatment baseline.</p><p>Advancing age did not appear to be associated with greater bone loss. Lower BMI, however, was associated with greater bone loss in subjects treated with elagolix 200 mg BID. The percentage of subjects with a decrease in BMD of &gt; 5% to &lt; 8% and ≥ 8% was higher in the lower BMI subsets (&lt; 25 kg/m 2 and 25 -&lt; 30 kg/m 2 ) in each of the three anatomic locations at month 6 of treatment and higher in the lowest BMI subset (&lt; 25 kg/m 2 ) at month 12 (ISS Tables 90, Cross reference:  <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 93</ref>, Cross reference: <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 5</ref>.2__25, <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 5</ref>.2__26, <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 5</ref>.2__27).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Applicant stated that</head><p>We disagree with the Applicant's interpretation of clinically meaningful bone loss. Decline in BMD at a time when subjects in the placebo arm were gaining BMD is clinically important. A decline in BMD of &gt; 8% over 6-12 months is clearly accelerated. However, the potential impact of bone loss in premenopausal women, with respect to lack of attainment of peak bone density and fracture risk later in life is uncertain.</p><p>Z-score Analysis An analysis of categorical change in Z-score was also performed. Subjects were required to have a Z-score &gt; -1.5 in order to be eligible to participate in the study, although seven Z-score measurements were actually ≤ -1.5 at entrance into the two pivotal trials. At the spine, the site of greatest bone loss, 94% of subjects in each active drug treatment arm had a Z-score &gt; -1.0 at baseline. There was no change in this percentage after 6 and 12 months of treatment with elagolix 150 mg QD, whereas the percentage of subjects with a Z-score &gt; -1.0 declined to 89% after 6 months of elagolix 200 mg BID, and to 83% at 12 months. Correspondingly, the proportion of subjects with a Z-score in the range of ≤ -1.5 to &gt; -2.0 increased from 0.7% (2 subjects) at baseline to 4.6% after 12 months of elagolix 200 mg BID. One subject in this treatment arm had a Z-score ≤ -2.0 at the spine (Source: ISS <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 83, Table 5</ref>.2__5.1).</p><p>The Z-score is a measure of the number of standard deviations above or below the agematched mean for the reference population. In the clinical setting, the International Society for Clinical Densitometry recommends using the Z-score to interpret BMD in pre-menopausal women. A Z-score between -2.0 and +2.0 is within the expected range for age, and a Z-score ≤ -2.0 is below the expected range for age. The relationship between Z-score and fracture risk in the premenopausal women is not robust. Z-scores should not be used to predict fracture risk in the manner that T-scores are used for postmenopausal women. In this study, over 90% of subjects had Z-scores &gt; -1.0 at baseline. The Z-score at the end of treatment is dependent not only on bone loss, but also baseline BMD. Therefore, it is not unexpected that Z-scores for all but one subject remained within the expected range for age despite significant bone loss. Zscores or change in Z-score categories do not inform risk for bone loss or recommendations for duration of treatment with elagolix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol violation: Systemic Glucocorticoid Use</head><p>Although systemic glucocorticoids were prohibited during the treatment phase and the first 3 months of the PTFU period, 6.6% of subjects in trial M12-665 and 3.2% of subjects in trial M12-671 received systemic glucocorticoids while they were on elagolix treatment. In the extension trials, 5% of subjects in trial M12-667 and 4.2% of subjects in trial M12-821 received systemic glucocorticoids while on elagolix. Systemic glucocorticoids were defined as glucocorticoids received by oral, intravenous or intra-articular routes. Duration of use was less than 1 month for all but seven subjects. These seven subjects used systemic glucocorticoids for 1 to &lt; 3 months. No subject used glucocorticoids for 3 months or more.</p><p>The use of prednisone 5 mg daily or more (or its equivalent) for ≥ 3 months is a risk factor for bone loss and fracture. The small number of subjects on elagolix treatment receiving glucocorticoids and the short duration of glucocorticoid use that occurred in these studies does not allow for meaningful interpretation of the impact on bone loss from concomitant elagolix and glucocorticoid use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation</head><p>Subjects were reminded to take calcium and vitamin D at each visit and intake was recorded. Overall, 83% of subjects included in the 6-month controlled BMD analysis and 86% of subjects included in the 12-month extension BMD analysis took one or both of these supplements. A post-hoc analysis suggested that after 12 months of treatment, the mean percent change in lumbar spine BMD from pre-treatment baseline for the Ela/Ela 150 mg QD subjects that did and did not take supplements was -0.78 (95% CI -1.23 to -0.33) as compared to -1.43 (95% CI -2.59 to -0.28), respectively. For the Ela/Ela 200 mg BID subjects that took supplements, mean percent change in lumbar spine BMD was -3.69 (95% CI -4.16 to -3.22) as compared to -4.17 (95% CI -5.34 to -3.00) for those that did not. However, confidence intervals were overlapping. (Source: ISS This analysis has several other limitations including that it is a post-hoc analysis, subjects were not randomized to calcium/vitamin D versus "no supplementation," and the number of subjects included in the "no supplementation" group is small. Furthermore, subjects who complied with recommendations for supplementation may have had other healthy lifestyle habits that may have benefited skeletal health. Although the results are inconclusive and calcium and vitamin D supplementation was not formally studied, it is reasonable to recommend adequate calcium </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Extension Trials</head><p>In extension study M12-667, the criteria for BMD monitoring during the PTFU period after 12 months of investigational drug was the same as those described above for the pivotal trials. For study M12-821, however, all subjects were required to have a PTFU month 6 DXA scan regardless of change in BMD after 12 months of investigational drug. The data for this group at PTFU month 6 is therefore more complete, and more representative of the entire cohort. Subsequently, only those subjects with persistent bone loss as defined for the pivotal trials above were required to have a PTFU month 12 scan. Mean percent change from pre-treatment baseline in lumbar spine BMD during 12 months of elagolix treatment and PTFU month 6 is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 20</ref> for subjects from studies M12-671 and M12-821 who had a DXA scan performed at all four timepoints. Change in BMD during the first 6 months of study M12-671 is also shown for placebo treated subjects. As discussed above, gains in BMD were seen in the placebo group over 6 months, while declines in BMD in a dose-dependent manner were observed for subjects receiving elagolix. At PTFU month 6, partial recovery of BMD was seen at the lumbar spine.</p><p>Mean percent change from baseline BMD at the lumbar spine is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 21</ref> for the subset of subjects who completed 12 months of elagolix treatment and had a PTFU month 12 DXA scan in extension study M12-821. Partial recovery in this subset of subjects was seen during 12 months of PTFU. Clinicians should be informed of the risk of decline in BMD while on elagolix and that BMD loss may not be completely reversible after stopping elagolix and should be advised to consider monitoring BMD in patients with risk factors for bone loss. Whether ongoing or complete recovery would occur in either group beyond 12 months after stopping treatment is unknown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Categorical Changes in BMD Post Treatment</head><p>In the extension trials, the percent recovery was assessed for subjects with BMD decreases from pre-treatment baseline to the final treatment value. The Applicant calculated percent recovery using the following formula: 100 Extension study M12-821 provides the most complete dataset to examine changes in BMD within the first 6 months post-treatment because all subjects were required to have a BMD at that timepoint (Source: M12-821 CSR <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 125</ref>). Twenty-three percent (14/60) of the subjects who entered extension study M12-821 were treated with elagolix 150 mg QD for up to 12 months, experienced a decrease in BMD from pre-treatment baseline to final BMD at the lumbar spine, and had a full recovery (&gt; 100%) at PTFU month 6. For the group treated with elagolix 200 mg BID for a total of 12 months and experienced bone loss at the lumbar spine, full recovery (&gt; 100%) was seen in 12% (9/74) of subjects at PTFU month 6.</p><p>both extension trials, ongoing declines in BMD were seen in a small subset of subjects during the PTFU period. In response to an Information Request, the Applicant provided an analysis of all subjects with a decline in lumbar spine BMD from final BMD in the extension studies during the PTFU period, including those who had DXA scans on machines from different manufacturers. Approximately 86% of these 118 subjects had a decline of ≤ 3%, a range considered to be within the variability of the DXA measurement. Of those with &gt; 3% decline in lumbar spine BMD (approximately 3% of the population with PTFU BMD data), the majority had at least 1 potential clinical risk factor or technical factor identified that might have contributed to the observed change in BMD. It is also noteworthy that, according to the Applicant, 6% of placebo-treated subjects in the pivotal trials had &gt;3% decline in BMD from baseline to treatment month 6, suggesting background variability in the DXA measurements.</p><p>The PK and PD properties of elagolix do not support ongoing bone loss after discontinuation of elagolix. The half-life of elagolix is 4 to 6 hours and the drug is completely eliminated from plasma within 24 to 30 hours. Estradiol levels begin to rise within 48 hours of drug discontinuation and menses resume within 6 months of drug discontinuation for at least 95% of subjects treated for 6 months, suggesting normalization of estradiol levels. In addition, nonclinical studies did not demonstrate any off-target adverse bone effects. The potential confounding clinical and technical factors these subjects had, the PK and PD properties of elagolix, and the observed bone loss in placebo-treated subjects in the pivotal trials, suggest that factors other than prior elagolix treatment are responsible for the observed decline in BMD during post-treatment follow-up.</p><p>After PTFU month 3, subjects were permitted to take medications on the list of prohibited medications <ref type="table" target="#tab_19">(Table 88)</ref>. With one exception, the most commonly used medications were glucocorticoids. In study M12-821, the most commonly used medication for the Placebo/elagolix 150 mg QD arm was combination oral contraceptives which was used by 3/9 subjects who took a prohibited medication. In response to an Information Request, the Applicant re-calculated mean percent change in BMD excluding subjects who took "prohibited" medications that could impact BMD. The numbers of subjects included in this analysis was too small to draw conclusions. However, use of medications associated with bone loss was a potential explanation for &gt;3% decline in lumbar spine BMD off treatment for some of the subjects in the analysis described above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bone Mineral Density Simulation Modeling</head><p>The Applicant only has BMD data for 12 months of treatment with elagolix and proposed simulation modeling to predict changes in lumbar spine BMD with elagolix treatment beyond 12 months. At the late cycle meeting held on February 12, 2018, we requested simulations predicting what would happen with up to 36 months of elagolix treatment. BMD changes upon continuous dosing with elagolix 150 mg QD or 200 mg BID for 36 months were predicted using two approaches: Indirect response exposure-BMD model (R&amp;D/17/0090 (Module 5, Section 5.3.4)) and quantitative systems pharmacology estradiol-BMD model (R&amp;D/17/0097 (Module 5, Section 5.3.5.4)). Simulations of BMD changes based on the indirect response model were performed using 100 trials of 100 subjects each, and results from the simulations were summarized as mean (95% CI) across the 100 simulated trials. The estradiol-BMD quantitative systems pharmacology model predictions for BMD changes over time were obtained using individual estradiol levels at month 6 from subjects treated with elagolix 150 mg QD or 200 mg BID for at least 6 months in Phase 3 studies (N = 1011), as input into the model. Means (95% CI) for the simulation results were calculated across 100 subsets of the individual simulations by random sampling. Results predicting changes in lumbar spine BMD with treatment at each dose of elagolix are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 22</ref>, <ref type="table" target="#tab_21">Table 94</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 23</ref>, and <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 95</ref> below. The indirect response exposure-BMD model appears to more closely parallel the pattern of change in BMD observed during the clinical trials. Specifically, bone loss in this model is associated with dose and duration of elagolix treatment without evidence of a plateau. In contrast, the quantitative systems pharmacology estradiol-BMD model shows a plateau to a slight increase in BMD with ongoing use which was not demonstrated in the clinical trials. The magnitude of bone loss at month 12 seen at the 150 mg QD dose with the indirect model is comparable to that observed in the clinical trials but at the 200 mg BID dose, the model appears to underestimate bone loss. This discrepancy in how the model performs at different doses raises concerns about its overall predictive ability. Another major limitation of these data is the lack of a simulated control group to predict gains in BMD during this time as was demonstrated in the pivotal trials over 6 months. This information would better inform risk. In addition, the model has not been validated in other populations of treated subjects. In summary, these simulations have important limitations and should not be used to reliably assess bone loss when elagolix is used beyond 12 months.</p></div>

All 3 subjects experienced bone loss on treatment, although the decline in BMD was minimal for the first subject.

The decline in BMD was detected as early as 6 months of treatment and appeared to be continuous for subjects treated with both doses, without evidence of a plateau during the 12 months of treatment studied. Conversely, subjects in the placebo group had gains in BMD over 6 months studied, as expected in premenopausal women, some of who may not yet have attained peak bone density. Recovery of bone loss was variable in the PTFU period. Partial recovery was observed for the majority of subjects assessed at PTFU month 6.</p><p>The study population had a BMD within the expected range for age as assessed by Z-score. Despite bone loss, the BMD of all but one participant remained within the expected range for age. In contrast to T-score which is used to estimate fracture risk in postmenopausal women, the relationship between Z-score and fracture risk is not robust, and Z-scores should not be used to diagnose osteoporosis. Changes in Z-scores do not sufficiently inform risk and should not be relied upon to interpret the impact of elagolix treatment on bone loss.</p><p>Other approved hormonal therapies associated with declines in BMD in premenopausal women include GnRH agonists (e.g., leuprolide) for endometriosis and uterine fibroids and depomedroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) for contraception. The duration of use for each of these therapies is limited in order to limit bone loss. In the case of leuprolide, treatment for endometriosis is limited to 6 months in the initial treatment course; an additional 6-month course can be administered only with norethindrone add-back therapy. In the clinical trial, leuprolide alone was associated with a mean percent change from baseline in spine BMD (the site of greatest bone loss) of -3.2% (95% CI -3.8, -2.6) after 6 months of treatment. In the case of DMPA for contraception in adolescents, bone loss as well as recovery was examined. Examination of the data according to duration of use for at least 2 years demonstrated mean percent changes from baseline BMD of -0.9%, -1.5% and -1.6% at the spine, total hip and femoral neck respectively. Full recovery was seen at the spine at 12 months and at the total hip and femoral neck at 18 months. Use for longer than 2 years resulted in greater bone loss and incomplete recovery at the total hip and femoral neck after 5 years post-treatment. Data are limited in that only a subset of subjects were monitored during recovery to inform these results. Nonetheless, DMPA has a boxed warning regarding the risk for decrease in BMD and incomplete recovery and the recommendation to limit its use to no more than 2 years. The degree of bone loss at the lumbar spine observed with elagolix 200 mg BID over 6 months is no more than that seen in the studies of leuprolide over 6 months, and bone loss with elagolix 150 mg BID over 12 months is much less. Consistent with the labeling for leuprolide, it is reasonable to mitigate the risk of bone loss by limiting the duration of treatment of elagolix 200 mg BID to no more than 6 months, and, assuming ongoing linear bone loss of under 1% per year, to limit treatment with elagolix 150 mg QD to no more than 24 months.</p><p>Simulation modeling of changes in BMD were not validated and therefore, should not be relied upon to inform the duration of treatment.</p><p>Data available from the elagolix clinical trials are insufficient to determine whether elagolix increases the risk for fracture. It is uncertain as to whether rapid bone loss increases the risk In summary, elagolix treatment was associated with dose and duration dependent declines in BMD, without evidence of a plateau over 12 months. Additionally, recovery of bone loss over 6 to 12 months off treatment was incomplete. The label should reflect the observed declines in BMD with elagolix treatment and lack of complete recovery. Additionally, limiting the duration of elagolix treatment is recommended. Taking into consideration the extent of decline in BMD with other therapies approved for use in premenopausal women, the duration of use for elagolix 200 mg BID should be limited to 6 months. Assuming the rate of bone loss observed over 12 months in the clinical trials for the elagolix 150 mg QD dose remains relatively constant, treatment with this dose for up to 24 months seems reasonable in women who respond to and require ongoing treatment for endometriosis. The effects of elagolix-associated changes in BMD on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. Assessment of BMD during treatment and/or post-treatment should be considered for patients with risk factors for bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not formally investigated, such supplementation may be beneficial.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.10.">Integrated Assessment of Safety</head><p>As of June 19, 2017, a total of 3611 subjects have received elagolix in the clinical studies included in this submission. Among these, 1557 subjects received elagolix for at least 6 months and 425 subjects received elagolix for at least 12 months, where each month reflects a 28-day period to coincide with the typical duration of a menstrual cycle. These numbers include subjects across the clinical development programs for both endometriosis and uterine fibroids who received elagolix alone or in combination with various forms of hormonal add-back therapy (i.e., from Phase 2 uterine fibroids studies) and other drugs.</p><p>In Phase 3 clinical studies, 685 women with endometriosis have received elagolix 150 mg QD, and 697 women with endometriosis have received elagolix 200 mg BID.</p><p>The principal safety concerns for elagolix in the endometriosis population includes the following:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head> Bone loss</head><p>The effect of elagolix on BMD was assessed by DXA in the Phase 3 program. BMD changes observed in the femoral neck and hip were typically less than those at the lumbar spine. In the Reference ID: 4295479</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">(b) (4) (b) (4)</formula><p>two placebo-controlled trials, lumbar spine BMD increased in placebo-treated subjects by 0.5% on average after 6 months because many subjects, who were young women, had not attained peak bone mass when treatment commenced. In contrast, in Studies 665 and 671, subjects treated with elagolix 150 mg QD lost BMD at the lumbar spine by 0.3 and 0.7% on average, respectively. Thus, compared to placebo subjects who gained bone, those who received elagolix 150 mg QD for 6 months experienced a loss of 0.8 and 1.3% in lumbar spine BMD on average, in Studies 665 and 671, respectively. BMD was further assessed in subjects who enrolled in the extension trials (approximately 60% of those who were randomized to begin treatment). In these subjects, mean lumbar BMD loss was approximately 1% after 12 months of treatment with elagolix 150 mg QD. These 12-month data are uncontrolled because the extension period did not include a placebo arm.</p><p>The adverse effect on BMD of elagolix 200 mg BID was more pronounced. Subjects treated for 6 months in the placebo-controlled trials experienced a mean 3.1% decrease in lumbar BMD compared to placebo-treated subjects. Among subjects who enrolled in the extension trials (again, approximately 60% of those who were randomized and started treatment with elagolix 200 mg BID), a mean BMD loss of 3.5 and 3.9% were observed in Studies 665 and 671, respectively.</p><p>Partial recovery was seen in subjects treated with elagolix who had follow-up BMD measurements during the PTFU period up to 12 months off therapy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head> Elevations in hepatic enzymes</head><p>No subjects met the criteria for Hy's law (i.e., no subject had AST and/or ALT at or more than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin at or more than twice the ULN) at any time point during elagolix treatment. However, our review identified a subject whose liver tests nearly met the Hy's law criteria, triggering a detailed review for hepatotoxicity. In response to our request, the Applicant eventually obtained the subject's medical records and confirmed a history of acute viral hepatitis A. Refer to section 8.2.4.6 for details of this case.</p><p>In placebo-controlled clinical trials (Studies 665 and 671), dose-dependent elevations of serum ALT at least three times the ULN were noted with treatment with elagolix: 0.1% (1 in 696) in the placebo group, 0.2% (1 in 450) in the 150 mg QD group, and 1.1% (5 in 443) in the 200 mg BID group.</p><p>One subject with a history of alcoholism and cirrhosis of the liver died 21 days after receiving a single-dose of elagolix 150 mg in Study M12-662 (pharmacokinetic study in subjects with hepatic impairment). The subject was found with bleeding noted near her nose and mouth, but the death was unwitnessed and autopsy was not performed. The death certificate lists chronic alcohol abuse with alcoholic cirrhosis as causes of death. Because the half-life of elagolix was less than 7 hours, the investigator and the Applicant judged the death as probably not related to elagolix. Compared to women with normal hepatic function, exposure of elagolix is NDA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 210450} {Orilissa and elagolix sodium} 203 increased 7-fold in subjects with severe hepatic impairment so use in this population will be contraindicated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head> Suicidal ideation, behavior and exacerbation of mood disorders</head><p>In placebo-controlled trials (Studies 665 and 671), treatment with elagolix was associated with adverse mood changes, particularly in patients with a history of depression <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">(Table 97</ref>). There has been one completed suicide and four patients with suicidal ideation among elagolixtreated patients in the Phase 2/3 endometriosis program. These cases are summarized below. In all three cases it is not possible to exclude drug causality.</p><p>One of the two deaths in the elagolix clinical program occurred in a subject who had received elagolix 150 mg QD for 31 days who died from suicide 2 days after the last dose of study drug in a Phase 3 endometriosis study (Study 671). The investigator assessed the death as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug and was likely due to multiple life stressors.</p><p>One subject receiving elagolix 150 mg QD in Study 665 reported suicidal ideation beginning on study day 113. Her past medical history indicated postpartum depression and depression. The study drug was permanently discontinued two days after the events. By the time the subject was evaluated by a mental health professional 23 days after stopping treatment, her depression and suicidal ideation had resolved.</p><p>A subject receiving 200 mg in Study 671 reported suicidal ideation and worsening depression and anxiety 12 days after starting treatment. Citalopram once daily was added to manage depression, in addition to continuing alprazolam. She was not evaluated by a mental health provider and was continued on elagolix. Two months later (on Study day 71), her suicidal ideation, mood swing, and agitation recurred; her citalopram was increased from once daily to twice daily. On study day 84, elagolix was permanently discontinued after a consultation with her primary care physician. The events of agitation and suicidal ideation were considered resolved on study day 111.</p><p>Additionally, a subject in an extension trial reported suicidal ideation after receiving elagolix 150 mg QD for 212 days (183 days in Study 665 and 29 more days in extension trial Study 667). The subject had a prior history of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. She declined a psychiatric referral and was treated with fluoxetine and elagolix was not interrupted due to these events. The suicidal ideation resolved 21 days after onset.</p><p>Further, suicidal ideation was also reported by a subject who received elagolix 75 mg BID for 24 weeks in a Phase 2 trial. Her past medical history included depression, two suicide attempts, bipolar disorder, and anxiety. The subject was able to complete the study despite being hospitalized for psychiatric treatment.</p><p>The totality of data from the clinical program indicate that treatment with elagolix is associated with adverse mood changes in women, particularly those with pre-existing mood disorders.</p><p> Change in menstrual bleeding pattern which may reduce the ability to recognize pregnancy</p><p>In subjects who reported menstrual bleeding, treatment with elagolix resulted in a dosedependent reduction in the mean number of days of bleeding/spotting, bleeding intensity, and bleeding duration. A dose-dependent increase in the percentage of women with amenorrhea (defined as no bleeding or spotting in a 56-day interval) was also observed. In Studies 665 and 671, the incidence of amenorrhea during the 6-month treatment ranged from 6-17% in subjects treated with elagolix 150 mg QD and 13-52% in those treated with elagolix 200 mg BID compared to less than 1% with placebo.</p><p>However, ovulation can still occur during treatment with elagolix. Of more than 3500 women (of whom more than 2000 had endometriosis and are presumed to have more difficulty achieving pregnancy) treated with elagolix for up to 12 months, 49 women (1.4%) became pregnant either while receiving elagolix treatment or within 30 days after stopping treatment. The annualized on-treatment pregnancy rates among subjects with up to 12 months of treatment exposure in the elagolix Phase 3 endometriosis clinical development program are 4.8% for placebo, 4.1% for elagolix 150 mg QD, and 2.7% for elagolix 200 mg BID.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head> Effects on lipid parameters</head><p>Dose-dependent increases in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides were noted during treatment with elagolix.</p><p>In Studies 665 and 671, 10 to 27% of subjects with mildly elevated LDL-C (130 to 159 mg/dL) at baseline developed LDL-C levels ≥ 190 mg/dL during treatment.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.3.">Statistical Issues</head><p>There were no statistical issues. The Applicant followed the prespecified statistical analysis plan and, from the statistical perspective, demonstrated the effectiveness of both proposed elagolix doses for the management of endometriosis with associated moderate to severe pain.</p><p>Elagolix 200 mg BID also demonstrated statistically significant reduction from baseline in dyspareunia compared to placebo, whereas elagolix 150 mg QD did not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.4.">Conclusions and Recommendations</head><p>Elagolix is a first-in-class, GnRH antagonist proposed for the management of endometriosis with associated moderate to severe pain. It will also be the only marketed oral therapy for moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis. Both elagolix 150 mg QD and 200 mg BID have been convincingly shown, in confirmatory placebo-controlled clinical trials, to increase the proportion of patients who reported a reduction in both dysmenorrhea and non-menstrual pelvic pain 3 months into treatment. Although the Applicant claims that treatment benefit was maintained into the blinded extension trials through 12 months of total treatment, sustained effect in reducing dysmenorrhea and non-menstrual pelvic pain cannot be ascertained because there are no controlled data beyond 6 months. The 200 mg BID dose, but not the 150 mg QD dose, also reduced dyspareunia, a symptom that can be distressing to women due to potential impact on their personal relationship.</p><p>There was consensus among all disciplines of the review team regarding the approvability of this application. Because of its mechanism of action, the safety profile of elagolix is generally consistent with agents that induce hypoestrogenism. There is also agreement among the review team that the risks can be mitigated with labeling alone. Among the safety issues NDA Multi-Disciplinary Review and Evaluation {NDA 210450} {Orilissa and elagolix sodium} 206 identified, bone loss is of the greatest concern, given the likelihood of chronic use of elagolix to delay or prevent surgery in women with endometriosis. The dose-and duration-dependent declines in BMD occurred during the time when some women were still accruing bone. Compared to subjects receiving placebo, those receiving elagolix 200 mg BID for 6 months had approximately 3% decrease in their lumbar BMD. This degree of bone loss is comparable to that observed in women treated with leuprolide after 6 months of injections for endometriosis. Therefore, the duration of use for elagolix 200 mg BID will be limited to 6 months consistent with the approach taken with leuprolide. Compared to subjects receiving placebo, those who were treated with elagolix 150 mg QD for 6 months experienced approximately a 1% mean reduction in lumbar spine BMD, and those who entered blinded extension trials continued to experience reduction in BMD. Based on the rate of bone loss over 12 months with 150 mg QD, we anticipate bone loss over 24 months with this dose being less or comparable to that seen with 200 mg BID for 6 months, supporting a treatment duration limitation of 24 months for the 150 mg QD regimen. For women who are close to menopause or who wish to delay surgical therapy, 6 to 24 months of treatment may offer benefit that offsets the concern with bone loss. Note that these duration limits are for women with normal liver function or mild hepatic impairment. For reasons explained in the clinical pharmacology section, there are different recommendations for women with more severe hepatic impairment and in the setting of certain drug-drug interactions. Consideration should be given to assessing BMD in patients with a history of a low-trauma fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss.</p><p>Other important safety issues, such as suicidality and exacerbation of mood disorders, changes in menstrual bleeding patterns that may reduce the ability to timely recognize pregnancy in women taking elagolix (and of child-bearing potential), and dose-related elevations in hepatic enzyme elevations will be described in the Warnings and Precautions sections of product labeling. The lipid effects will be described in the Adverse Reactions section of the label.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.">Postmarketing Requirements and Commitments</head><p>The Division has requested three postmarketing requirements (PMRs) and one postmarketing commitment (PMC).</p><p>As a GnRH receptor antagonist, elagolix may cause a decrease in progesterone production in early pregnancy and in turn increase the risk for pregnancy complications. Although elagolix inhibits ovulation in a dose-dependent manner, neither proposed dosing regimen suppressed ovulation enough for the drug to be considered an acceptable alternative for contraception. As discussed in section 8.2.5.4, there were 49 reported pregnancies in women treated with elagolix to date (47 in the endometriosis program and 2 in the fibroid program) where hormonal contraceptives were prohibited. Of the 49 pregnancies, 15 resulted in elective abortions, 5 resulted in spontaneous abortions, 6 were lost to followup, and 23 were carried to term. Among the 23 pregnancies that were carried to term, 2 subjects delivered infants with congenital anomalies (cleft palate and tracheo-esophageal fistula). These data were too limited to draw definitive conclusions regarding the effect of elagolix on pregnancy outcomes. Because endometriosis occurs in women of reproductive age in whom pregnancy may become more likely when symptoms of endometriosis abate, meaningful data on outcomes of pregnancies exposed to elagolix are needed to further inform safety post-approval. The Applicant is required and has agreed to conduct:</p><p> PMR 1: a prospective pregnancy registry study to evaluate and maternal and fetal/neonatal outcomes  PMR 2: a pharmacoepidemiologic surveillance study to evaluate pregnancy-related outcomes</p><p>We are also requiring the following drug-drug interaction trial (see the rationale for this trial in Clinical Pharmacology section 6.3.2.4):</p><p> PMR 3: a drug-drug interaction study to assess the PK, safety, and tolerability of the coadministration of a combined oral contraceptive (containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel) with elagolix 200 mg BID Because endometriotic lesions are estrogen-dependent, concomitant use of elagolix and estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives is expected to reduce elagolix's effectiveness in managing pain. For this reason, all hormonal contraceptives (estrogen-containing and progestin-only) were prohibited in the clinical program. Thus, the extent to which the effectiveness of elagolix may be reduced during co-administration with estrogen-containing contraceptive is unknown. However, given the uncertainty surrounding pregnancies exposed to elagolix and the need for effective contraceptive methods other than permanent sterilization or barrier methods/spermicides, such information would help patients with endometriosis and providers make informed choices as to the treatment options. The Applicant has agreed to conduct:</p><p> PMC 1: a clinical trial in women taking elagolix and a combined hormonal contraceptive to assess the efficacy of elagolix and the efficacy of the combined hormonal contraceptive Synopses of these PMRs and the PMC and associated milestones were submitted by the Applicant on April 17, 2018.

A salt-assisted protein precipitation extraction method for the determination of elagolix was employed for plasma samples. Separation was conducted on a Zorbax SB-C18 5 μm 2.1 × 50 mm column. The mobile phase consisted of a 50:50 (v/v) mixture of acetonitrile: water containing 10 mM ammonium acetate and 0.1% acetic acid, at an isocratic flow rate of 0.6 mL/min, with a total run time of 3.5 minutes. The same HPLC conditions were employed in Methods R&amp;D/11/991 and R&amp;D/11/992 but there was a difference in mass spectrometer parameters. To determine the two elagolix metabolites A-1323217 and A-1298847, two MRM scan ion transitions m/z 618 → 515 and m/z 546 → 177 were added to the Method R&amp;D/11/992.

Three method validation reports (Report #: R&amp;D/11/124, R&amp;D/17/0279, and R&amp;D/17/0280) and one stability update validation report (Report #: R&amp;D/17/0281) were submitted to support the bioanalysis of estradiol and progesterone in serum samples in Phase 1 and Phase 3 studies conducted by AbbVie.</p><p>For quantitation of estradiol, the serum extracts were evaporated, derivatized with dansyl chloride and separated on a Phenomenex Kinetex 2.6 μm C18 100 Å 50 × 2.1 mm column coupled with a Waters Xbridge C18 5 μm 2.1 × 10 mm guard column. The mobile phase consisted of a 75:25:0.1 (by volume) mixture of acetonitrile: water: formic acid at an isocratic flow rate of 0.6 mL/min, with a total run time of 2.0 minutes. Analysis was performed on an ABSciex mass spectrometer with a Turbo Ion Spray interface; the dansyl derivatives were detected in the MRM mode at m/z 506.2 → 171.1 for estradiol and at m/z 509.0 → 171.1 for estradiol-d3 (the internal standard for estradiol). Similarly, for progesterone quantitation, the reconstituted extracts were separated on a Phenomenex Kinetex 2.6 μm C18 100 Å 2.1 × 50 mm column coupled with a Waters Xbridge C18 5 μm 2.1 × 10 mm guard column. The mobile phase consisted of a 50:5:45 (by volume) mixture of acetonitrile: methanol:(water with 2 mM ammonium formate) at an isocratic flow rate of 0.4 mL/min, with a total run time of 3.0 minutes. Detection was performed in the MRM mode at m/z 315.3 → 109 for progesterone and at m/z 324.4 → 113 for formulation (50 mg/tablet and 150 mg/tablet) was used in 16 Phase 1 studies conducted by AbbVie.

Per the Applicant's analysis, the elagolix 200 mg IR tablet ( light orange formulation) was bioequivalent to two elagolix 100 mg IR tablets ( formulation). This reviewer did BE analysis using the same individual subject PK parameter dataset and the results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>.1-2. Although the geometric means of C max , AUC 0-t and AUC 0-∞ of both test and reference formulations calculated by this reviewer are lower than that submitted by the Applicant, both the Applicant's and this reviewer's calculations showed that the two formulations are bioequivalent. The effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of the commercial light orange formulation were shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>.1-3. The Applicant's analysis showed that, under high-fat meal conditions, the elagolix light orange formulation 200 mg IR tablet had a lower exposure relative to fasted conditions; with a decrease of 36% and 24% in C max and AUC 0-∞ , respectively. However, this reviewer's analysis showed a decrease of 38% and 26% in C max and AUC 0-∞ , respectively.  The Applicant's exposure-response analyses and simulations showed that 24% decrease of elagolix exposure under fed conditions did not have a clinically meaningful impact on DYS and NMPP responder rates. This reviewer agrees that 24% decrease of elagolix exposure is not expected to have a clinically meaningful impact on the efficacy. Elagolix can be orally administered without regard to meals and no dose adjustment was recommended under fed conditions.  This reviewer assessed the effects of study sequence on the PK parameters of elagolix. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>.1-4, study sequence had no obvious effects on the C max or T max of elagolix. However, a decreasing trend in AUC was observed under fasting conditions <ref type="figure">(Regimen A and B)</ref> and an increasing trend in AUC was observed under fed conditions (Regimen C).

The average baseline progesterone levels were 35.3 nmol/L, 3.3 nmol/L, and 5.4 nmol/L for elagolix 600 mg, 900 mg, and placebo groups, which precluded a valid progesterone comparison of 600 mg group with placebo group. Considering the progesterone measurement variability and the slight differences in progesterone levels between 900 mg group and placebo group, we cannot draw a conclusion whether there was progesterone suppression within 48 hours after administration of a single dose of 900 mg elagolix. Luteinizing Hormone (LH) Suppression: As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3.1-4</ref>, compared to placebo group, LH appeared to be suppressed with administration of a single dose of 600 or 900 mg elagolix although dose-dependent suppression was not observed. A maximal suppression was observed at 12-18 hours post-dose.  Reviewer's Comments:  In this study, subjects received elagolix or placebo at any timepoint during the menstrual cycle (between approximately 3 and 25 days after the date of their last menses with cycle durations ranging from 27 to 32 days), which resulted in a largely variable baseline hormone values. The single-dose hormone suppression findings are difficult to interpret in this study, since subjects were in different stages of the menstrual cycles when dosing began and large differences in baseline levels of hormones were observed among treatment groups and placebo group.  Compared to placebo group, estradiol suppression was observed in 900 mg group within 48 hours post-dose.  Compared to placebo group, a slight decrease in progesterone levels in elagolix 900 mg group. A valid conclusion on whether there was progesterone suppression after administration of a single dose of 900 mg elagolix cannot be drawn.  Compared to placebo group, LH and FSH appeared to be suppressed with administration of a single dose of 600 or 900 mg elagolix although dose-dependent suppression was not observed.</p></div>

The mean ± SD PK parameters of elagolix are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 3</ref>.2-1. Elagolix was characterized by a rapid absorption with a T max of approximately 1 -1.3 hour. After reaching C max , elagolix concentrations declined in a biphasic fashion with an estimated T 1/2 of 4 to 6 hours. The mean ± SD dose-normalized C max and AUCτ were plotted against doses in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 3.2-2</ref>. On Day 1, both dose-normalized C max and AUCτ increased with dose. Elagolix showed an approximately doseproportional increase in exposures from 100 mg BID to 200 mg BID and a more than dose-proportional increase from 200 mg BID to 400 mg BID. At steady state (Day 21), elagolix showed a dose-proportional increase in exposures (C max and AUCτ) from 100 mg BID to 400 mg BID.</p><p>The mean accumulation ratio was less than 1 among all elagolix doses, indicating no drug accumulation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Table 3.2-1)</ref>. The mean accumulation ratios at high doses (0.78 for 300 mg BID and 0.84 for 400 mg BID) were lower than that at low doses (0.98 for 100 mg BID and 0.89 for 200 mg BID). Following multiple doses of 300 mg and 400 mg BID, the mean AUCτ were 22% to 16% lower than those observed on Day 1.</p><p>To assess drug accumulation, the Applicant plotted mean predose concentrations (C trough ) of elagolix against study day <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Figure 3.2-2)</ref>. The data showed that a steady-state C trough was likely achieved on Day 15 across all the four BID dose groups. It is unlikely that C trough would further decrease beyond Day 22.  Reviewer's Comments:  The Applicant claimed that elagolix exhibits an approximately dose-proportional increase in exposures from 100 mg BID to 400 mg BID based on the PK data collected on Day 21 and Day 22. This reviewer agrees that elagolix showed a linear PK up to 400 mg BID at a steady state. However, for single-dose PK on Day 1, the approximate dose-proportionality was observed up to 200 mg only. In the dose range of 200 -400 mg, single-dose showed a greater than dose proportional increase in C max and AUCτ. Combined with the single-dose PK results from Study M13-784 (600 mg and 900 mg) and Study 12-661 (300 mg and 1200 mg), this reviewer concluded that single-dose elagolix showed a more than dose-proportional PK from 200 mg to 1200 mg.  The different PK characteristics of single-dose and multi-dose elagolix probably can be explained by hepatic enzyme and/or transporter auto-induction by elagolix. Clinical DDI studies  showed that 150 mg QD and 300 mg QD elagolix induced hepatic metabolic enzyme CYP3A. Study M12-660 showed that elagolix is a substrate of CYP3A. Co-administration of 20 mg QD rosuvastatin with multiple-dose elagolix 300 mg BID resulted in a decrease of rosuvastatin AUC by 40% <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Study M13-756</ref>), suggesting that elagolix is likely to be an inducer of hepatic transporters OATP1B1 and/or BCRP. Both in vitro and in vivo DDI data showed that elagolix is a substrate of OATP1B1. The auto-induction of CYP3A, OATP1B1 and/or BCRP may explain the low values of drug accumulation ratio (R ac &lt; 1) and the different characteristics of single-dose and multi-dose PK at high doses <ref type="bibr">(&gt; 200 mg)</ref>.  The continuous decrease in drug exposure caused by hepatic enzyme and/or transporter autoinduction might raise a potential concern on efficacy. The C trough data collected between Day 1 and Day 22 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Figure 3.2-3)</ref> showed that a steady-state C trough was achieved on Day 15, suggesting a maximal induction of CYP3A, OATP1B1 and/or BCRP was achieved in 2-3 weeks. The longterm elagolix treatment is not expected to compromise efficacy, which is further confirmed by Phase 3 efficacy data.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 3</ref>.2-2, E2 suppression was observed within 6 hours of dosing and E2 concentrations were lower following elagolix administration compared to placebo. At the dose of 150 mg QD, E2 was partially suppressed. A nearly full suppression of E2 appeared to be achieved at doses of 200 mg BID and higher and a steady-state E2 suppression appeared to be achieved on Day 3. Following the last dose of elagolix on Day 21, E2 suppression was maintained for ≥12 hours in most subjects who received elagolix doses ≥ 200 mg BID.</p><p>An exposure-response analysis for E2 suppression was conducted at steady state using elagolix AUC 0-24 on Study Day 21 and hormone AUC 0-21d for E2 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Figure 3.2-5</ref>). An elagolix AUC 0-24 of approximately 0.63 μg*h/mL, corresponding to an elagolix daily dose of approximately 70 mg/day, was estimated to reduce E2 AUC 0-21d by 50% relative to placebo. Elagolix suppression of E2 appears to reach a maximum at doses of approximately 200 mg BID. Progesterone (P): Anovulatory concentrations (&lt; 5 nM) were observed in all subjects at elagolix doses of 100 mg BID (200 mg daily total) and above, and remained lower than 5 nM at 24 hours after the last dose on Study Day 21 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Figure 3.2-4</ref>). An increase in mean P concentrations for the 150 mg QD dose group on Day 17. Due to the very low baseline P levels in the 150 mg QD, 100 mg BID, 200 mg BID and 300 mg BID groups, it was difficult to detect the initiation of P suppression during Day 1 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Figure 3.2-4 and Table 3.2-3)</ref>. For the 400 mg BID group, P suppression was observed within 12 hours post dose and the maximal suppression was achieved on Day 4. Progesterone dose-response and exposure-response observed data could not be fit to an inhibitory model due to a steep dose-response and exposure-response relationship. LH concentrations decreased in a dose dependent manner compared to placebo, with a maximal inhibition observed at doses of 300 mg BID and higher <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Figure 3.2-4)</ref>. For placebo subjects the LH surge was observed on around Day 9. LH suppression was observed in subjects at doses of 200 mg BID and above. LH was partially suppressed in 150 mg QD group. The blood LH concentrations measured on Day 1 indicated that LH suppression initialized within 4 hours post dose <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Table 3.2-4)</ref>. Suppression of LH was lost within 24 hours after the last dose of elagolix on Day 21 in the 200 mg BID group.  The exposure-response relationship for LH suppression were described using an inhibitory sigmoidal effect function <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Figure 3.2-6)</ref>. Elagolix AUC 0-24 of approximately 1.36 μg*h/mL, corresponding to an elagolix daily dose of approximately 188 mg/day, was estimated to reduce LH AUC 0-21d by 50% relative to placebo treatment. The effect of elagolix on LH suppression appears to reach a maximum at a dose of 300 mg BID.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FSH:</head><p>FSH suppression was found dependent on the dose of elagolix <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Figure 3.2-4</ref>). An initial decline in mean FSH concentrations was observed within 4 hours post dose on Day 1 at an elagolix dose of 150 mg QD <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Table 3.2-5)</ref>. After the initial decline, mean FSH concentrations rebounded within 24 hours and remained higher than the placebo. At an elagolix dose of 200 mg BID, FSH suppression was observed and maintained through Day 21 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Figure 3.2-4)</ref>. A maximal FSH inhibition was expected to be achieved at an elagolix dose at ≥400 mg BID compared to placebo. Suppression of FSH was lost at 24 to 36 hours after the last dose of elagolix on Day 21 at all doses evaluated in this study. An elagolix daily dose of approximately 622 mg/day is estimated to reduce FSH AUC 0-21d by 50% relative to placebo <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Figure 3.2-7)</ref>.  Reviewer's Comments:  The PK/PD study showed that 21-day elagolix 150 mg QD treatment partially suppressed E2, P and LH but did not obviously suppress FSH compared to placebo. In contrast, 200 mg BID treatment caused a near maximal suppression of E2 and a partial suppression of LH and FSH. At doses of 100 mg BID (200 mg daily total) or greater, P concentrations remained at anovulatory levels below 5 nmol/L over the duration of the study.  The suppression of LH and FSH was observed within 4 hours post dose on Day 1 while the suppression of LH and FSH was observed within 6-12 hours post dose on Day 1, which are similar with the findings in the SAD study .  After the last dose on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Day 21, the suppression of the four hormones was maintained for 12 -36</ref> hours.  The exposure-response analysis on LH and E2 suppression may be confounded by dosing frequency.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design:</head><p>This Phase 1 open-label, multi-center, multiple-dose study was conducted in premenopausal female subjects to evaluate the effects of different dosing regimens of elagolix (alone or with Std Activella) on ovulation, ovarian activity and ovarian reserve when administered to healthy, adult premenopausal females and to assess the effect of elagolix (alone or with Std Activella) on selected endocrine/hormone parameters. A total of 205 subjects (N = 205) were randomly assigned to seven treatment groups <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">(Table  3</ref>.5-1). Women aged 18 to 40 years, inclusive, with a history of regular menstrual cycles (24 to 32 days long) were selected to participate in the study.

The mean E2 concentrations were the highest with the elagolix 100 mg QD regimen (60-70 pg/mL). The 150 mg QD, 200 mg QD and 100 mg BID regimens appeared to have similar mean E2 levels (~ 43 pg/mL and 54 pg/mL, 45 pg/mL and 58 pg/mL, and 30 pg/mL and 50 pg/mL at Cycle 1 and Cycle 3, respectively). The 200 mg BID and 300 mg BID regimens appeared to have the lowest mean E2 levels (~ 19 pg/mL and 41 pg/mL and 18 pg/mL and 32 pg/mL, at Cycle 1 and Cycle 3, respectively). When Std Activella was added to the 300 mg BID dose, the mean E2 concentrations were maintained in the 50 to 100 pg/mL range throughout each cycle and were above the mean E2 concentrations observed in the regimens of 150 mg QD.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">(Figure 3.5-3)</ref>.

During the Treatment Phase, the 100 mg QD, 150 mg QD, 200 mg QD and 100 mg BID regimens appeared to have similar mean FSH concentrations of 6 to 7 IU/L. The 200 mg BID regimen appeared to have lower mean FSH concentrations of 4 to 5 IU/L. concentrations of 6 to 7 IU/L. The 200 mg BID regimen appeared to have lower mean FSH concentrations of 4 to 5 IU/L. The 300 mg BID doses had slightly lower mean FSH concentrations of approximately 4 IU/L compared to the 200 mg BID dose.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comments:</head><p> The hormone suppression observed in the MAD study  was greater than that observed in this study. For example, the mean estradiol concentration in subjects treated with 200 mg BID regimen was approximately 10-15 pg/mL in Study M12-790 while the mean estradiol concentration observed in this study was approximately 25 pg/mL. The Applicant's explanation of the observed difference is the less than optimal adherence to dosing schedules in current study . In Study M12-790, dosing was observed and hand/mouth compliance checks were performed for 21 day. In contrast, doses were self-administered in Study M12-673. The nonadherence to dosing schedules may cause the less hormone suppression.  In women with endometriosis, ovulation can make the symptoms of endometriosis worse.</p><p>Suppression of ovulation is one of the action mechanisms of elagolix to manage the pain associated with endometriosis. The dose-dependent suppression of ovulation by elagolix demonstrated in Study M12-673 provides additional evidence for the management of endometriosis associated pain.  Based on the potency of hormone suppression and ovulation suppression, the dose regimens tested in this study are divided into four categories:</p><p>Group 1 with limited suppression: 100 mg QD Group 2 with moderate suppression: 150 mg QD, 200 mg QD and 100 mg BID Group 3 with potent suppression: 200 mg BID and 300 mg BID Group 4 with highest suppression: 300 mg BID + Std Activella</p><p>The different potency of 150 mg QD and 200 mg BID regimens in hormone suppression and ovulation suppression may provide options to patients with different severity of symptoms.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design:</head><p>This was a Phase 1, single-dose, fasting, open-label study designed to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of elagolix in female subjects with normal or impaired renal function. A total of 15 preor post-menopausal female subjects were enrolled and assigned to three groups: 6 subjects with normal renal function to mild renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 , Group I), 3 subjects with moderate to severe renal impairment (eGFR between 15 and &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 , Group II), and 6 subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) (eGFR &lt; 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 , Group III, 5 subjects required dialysis). Each subject received a single dose of 200 mg elagolix on Day 1 under fasting conditions. Blood samples for elagolix assay were collected by venipuncture approximately 15 minutes prior to dosing (0 hour) and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">2,</ref><ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">10,</ref><ref type="bibr">12,</ref><ref type="bibr">16,</ref><ref type="bibr">24,</ref><ref type="bibr">36</ref>, and 48 hours after elagolix dosing.</p><p>PK Results:  The mean values of C max and AUC in female subjects with normal renal function to mild renal impairment, moderate to severe renal impairment, or ESRD were comparable <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">(Table 3</ref>.6-1). Elagolix mean C max , AUC t , and AUC ∞ appeared to be slightly higher in subjects with normal renal function to mild renal impairment compared to subjects with moderate to severe renal impairment and subjects with ESRD. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 3.6-2</ref> showed the distribution of individual subject AUC values by groups. Plasma binding study showed that renal impairment status did not impact protein binding of elagolix. The mean plasma unbound fraction of elagolix in subjects with normal renal function to mild renal impairment, moderate to severe impairment, and ESRD was 0.097 ± 0.007, 0.106 ± 0.014, and 0.119 ± 0.008, respectively. The mean C max , AUC t , and AUC ∞ of unbound elagolix were approximately similar across the three groups.</p><p>Reviewer's Comment:  Due to the difficulty in recruiting subjects with moderate to severe renal impairment, the Applicant enrolled 3 subjects only. The sample size is small.  Since approximately 3% of elagolix in human body is cleared by renal excretion, it is unexpected that the AUC of elagolix in ESRD patients is lower than that in subjects with normal renal function to mild renal impairment. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 3.6-2</ref> showed one outlier (Subject ) in the group with normal renal function to mild renal impairment. Subject had an AUC value of more than 6000 ng*h/mL. After Subject was removed, this reviewer recalculated the mean PK parameters of elagolix, which are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 3</ref>.6-2. The exclusion of Subject does not affect the conclusion that renal impairment status does not impact elagolix exposure. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Results:</head><p>A total of 4 subjects experienced at least one treatment-emergent AE and a total of 11 mild or moderate AEs were reported: 2 subjects (2/6, 33.3%) with normal renal function, 1 subject (1/3, 33.3%) with moderate to severe renal impairment, and 1 subject (1/6, 16.7%) with ESRD. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent AEs were nausea (one in each treatment group) and headache (one in each treatment group). No deaths, other serious adverse events or other significant adverse events occurred during the study. No adverse events led to discontinuation during the study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background:</head><p>Elagolix is primarily metabolized by the CYP3A enzyme and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6 and CYP2C8 enzymes. Elagolix is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein transporter (P-gp), and organic anion transporter protein 1B1 (OATP1B1). Clinical study M12-660 showed that the steady state C max and AUC of elagolix increased by 1.8-and 2.2-fold, respectively, when elagolix 150 mg QD was co-administered with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor. When a single dose of 150 mg elagolix was co-administered with a single dose of rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer and dual modulator for P-gp and OATP transporters, the C max and AUC of elagolix increased by 4.4-and 5.6-fold, respectively (Study M12-659). When a single dose of 150 mg elagolix was given at day 10 of repeat dosing of rifampin, the C max and AUC of elagolix increased by 2.0-and 1.7-fold, respectively (Study M12-659).</p><p>Elagolix is an inducer of CYP3A enzymes. Study NBI-56418-0502 showed that the C max and AUC of midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate) decreased by 19% and 35%, respectively, when administered with multiple doses of elagolix at the dose of 150 mg QD. Study M15-629 showed that the C max and AUC of midazolam decreased by 44% and 55%, respectively, when administered with multiple doses of elagolix at the dose of 300 mg BID. The DDI potential of elagolix as a CYP3A inducer at the dose of 200 mg BID was not clinically evaluated. The applicant used PBPK model to predict the DDI effect of elagolix at a dose of 200 mg BID on a single-dose of midazolam at 5 mg.</p><p>Elagolix is an inhibitor of P-gp transporter. After administration of elagolix as a single (200 mg) or multiple (200 mg BID) doses, the C max and AUC of digoxin (substrate of P-gp transporter) increased by approximately 70% and 30%, respectively (Study M12-652). The applicant used PBPK model to predict the DDI effect of elagolix at a dose of 150 mg QD on a single-dose of digoxin at 0.5 mg.</p><p>This review evaluates the adequacy of applicant's elagolix PBPK models to predict the DDI potential of elagolix as a perpetrator, and provides dosing recommendations based on the predicted DDIs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method:</head><p>The models and simulation results described here were performed using Simcyp (V15.0.86.0, Simcyp Ltd., a Certara Company, Sheffield, United Kingdom). The workflow of the DDI prediction model development, verification and application is described below:</p><p>Model Development and Optimization: A full PBPK model was developed and optimized using the human pharmacokinetic data of elagolix in healthy female subjects from Study M12-790. The relative contribution of various enzymes and transporters in the disposition of elagolix was initially based on in vitro transporters and metabolism data, optimized based on mass balance data from an ADME study in humans (Study NBI-56418-0601) and the rifampin DDI study (Study M12-659). Data from Study NBI-56418-0502 and Study M12-652 were used to optimize the elagolix perpetrator model.</p><p>Model Verification: Clinical data from the ketoconazole-elagolix DDI study (Study M12-660) was used to verify the contribution of CYP3A4/P-gp in overall disposition of elagolix.</p><p>Model Application: After model development and verification, the elagolix PBPK model was used to predict the effect of elagolix as a perpetrator on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin and midazolam at 150 QD and 200 mg BID doses of elagolix, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Parameters:</head><p>The physiological parameters for a healthy population were the same as reported by Simcyp (Version 15.0.86.0). The P-gp expression level in liver and the intestine was increased by 4-fold on Day 10 of the rifampin-elagolix DDI study because rifampin has been reported to induce P-gp expression by 4-fold 1 . The drug specific parameters for digoxin and midazolam PBPK models were the same as reported by Simcyp. The drug specific parameters for elagolix are provided below:</p><p>Simulation Study Design:</p><p>The study design for each simulation is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_124">Table 4</ref>.11-1. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Results:</head><p>Elagolix Model Performance in Predicting Multi-dose PK: As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_124">Table 4</ref>.11-2, the PBPK model was able to capture the pharmacokinetic profile and pharmacokinetic parameters reasonably well following multiple doses of elagolix 150 QD or 200 mg BID. The %PE values for the predicted AUC, C max and CL/F was less than 15%. Source: <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> in the Applicant's study report R&amp;D/17/0098</p><p>Model Performance in Predicting Elagolix As a Victim Drug:</p><p>The contribution of OATP1B1 in the uptake of elagolix was optimized using the DDI Study M12-659 (elagolix with a single 600 mg dose of rifampin). Following coadministration of a single dose of elagolix 150 mg and a single dose of rifampin 600 mg, the observed C max and AUC ratios for elagolix on Day 1 were 4.37 and 5.58, respectively. The simulated ratios for the DDI, following model optimization, for C max and AUC were 3.20-and 4.00-fold, respectively <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Table 4.11-3)</ref>. The CYP3A4 and P-gp contributions were also optimized using clinical data from Study M12-659. Following coadministration of multiple doses of rifampin 600 mg QD for 12 days and a single dose of elagolix 150 mg on Day 10, the model simulated elagolix C max and AUC ratios on Day 10 were 2.28 and 2.29, respectively <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Table 4.11-3)</ref>. The predicted C max and AUC ratios were within the predefined acceptance limit.</p><p>Contribution of the CYP3A4/P-gp pathway in the metabolism of elagolix was verified using the DDI study with ketoconazole. The model simulated C max and AUC ratios of elagolix were 2.01 and 2.13, respectively, and the observed C max and AUC ratios were 1.77 and 2.20, respectively <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Table 4.11-3)</ref>. The performance of the model prediction is acceptable.</p><p>Model Performance in Predicting Elagolix As a Perpetrator Drug: For DDI between elagolix 150 mg QD and single-dose midazolam 5 mg, the model-based simulations (predicted AUC ratio of 0.69) closely matched with the observed AUC ratio of 0.65 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Table 4.11-3)</ref>.</p><p>For the DDI between multi-dose elagolix 200 mg BID and single-dose digoxin 0.5 mg, the Day 1 and Day 10 predicted C max ratios were 1.74 and 1.73, respectively, and the AUC ratios were 1.22 and 1.19, respectively. These model results were in agreement with the observed Day 1 and Day 10 C max ratios (1.73 and 1.71) and the Day 1 and Day 10 AUC ratios (1.32 and 1.26) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Table 4.11-3)</ref>.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 3</ref> in the Applicant's study report R&amp;D/17/0098</p><p>Reviewer's Comments: 1. The reviewer noted the underprediction of OATP1B1 inhibition by rifampin on Day 1. The predicted C max and AUC ratios were still within the predefined acceptance limit. The objectives of current study were to assess elagolix as a perpetrator to inhibit P-gP and to induce CYP3A. As long as the model can accurately predict multi-dose PK of elagolix, the underprediction of OATP1B1 inhibition would not be a major concern as OAT1B1 is not involved in the transport of digoxin or midazolam. 2. The reviewer repeated the applicant's elagolix-midazolam DDI model in Simcyp Version 16. The predicted C max and AUC ratios for 2 mg midazolam after 14 days of elagolix 150 mg QD were 0.67 and 0.62. The model performance in terms of C max and AUC ratio was acceptable. The reviewer recommends that the model be further verified with the DDI data between elagolix 300 mg BID regimen and a single-dose of midazolam from Study M15-629. 3. The reviewer verified the applicant's elagolix-digoxin DDI model in Simcyp Version 16. The predicted C max and AUC 0-72hr ratios for digoxin on Day 1 of elagolix 200 mg BID treatment were 1.73 and 1.26, respective, and on Day 10 were 1.52 and 1.23, respectively. Possible sources for the differences between reviewer and applicant's exposure ratios are 1) Simulation trial setting: the applicant's verification trial for Day 10 was incorrectly simulated under elagolix 150 mg QD; and 2) Calculation method: the applicant calculated digoxin AUC up to 48 hours post dose while the reviewer calculated digoxin AUC up to 72 hours post dose. The performance of sponsor's model prediction is acceptable based on reviewer's analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PBPK Model Applications:</head><p>The elagolix PBPK model was used to predict the DDI effect on a single dose of 5 mg midazolam at the proposed clinical dose of 200 mg BID. At the 200 mg BID dose, the AUC of midazolam is predicted to decrease by 56% while the C max is predicted to decrease by 49% <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Table 4.11-4)</ref>. The model was also used to predict the change in C max and AUC of digoxin, following multiple doses of elagolix 150 mg QD. On Day 1 the C max and AUC of digoxin are predicted to increase by 68% and 19%; while on Day 10, C max and AUC of digoxin are predicted to increase by 73% and 19%, respectively <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Table 4.11-4)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DDI between elagolix 150 mg QD and digoxin:</head><p>The reviewer verified the Applicant's analysis in Simcyp Version 16. The simulation results supported the Applicant's conclusion that "elagolix 150 mg QD is expected to increase digoxin AUC &lt; 1.25-fold". Since elagolix is predicted to increase the C max of digoxin by &gt;50% following a single 150 mg dose, the Applicant's proposal to monitor patients receiving digoxin along with elagolix is acceptable.</p></div>

A total of 1624 subjects were included in the analysis from Studies M12-790 (n = 34), M12-653 (n = 23), M13-995 (n = 23), M14-731 (n = 54), M12-673 (n = 179), M12-665/M12-667 (n = 682), and M12-671/M12-821 (n = 629). The demographic data for subjects included in the final population PK dataset is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 5</ref>.1-1 and <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 5</ref>.1-2.  Population PK Model Development Base Model: The selected base model was a two-compartment model with lag time, combined residual error model, and inter-individual variability on CL/F, V2/F (incorporating correlation using a block matrix). The estimated pharmacokinetic parameter values and their associated variability for the elagolix pharmacokinetic base model are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 5</ref>.1-3. Source: <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 6</ref> on page 47 of Applicant's population PK report rd170088</p><p>Final Model: Covariates investigated for influence on each of the elagolix pharmacokinetic parameters such as apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V2/F) included age, body weight, body mass index, race, ethnicity, albumin, bilirubin, aspartate amino transferase (AST), alanine amino transferase (ALT), tobacco use, alcohol use, organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) genotype status, and study region. Creatinine and creatinine clearance were also tested on apparent clearance (CL/F). The only covariate lowering the OFV significantly was the OATP genotype as a covariate on CL/F. None of the other covariates tested were significant. As the p-value for the addition of OATP genotype was &lt; 0.001, the full model was also the final model. Addition of this covariates to the model resulted in a minor decrease in inter-individual variability on CL/F from 43.9% to 42.5%.

Reviewer's comments: Overall, the final population PK model appeared to be able to characterize the PK profile of elagolix as indicated in the applicant's goodness-of-fit plots. However, a lot of observations were not well predicted in the plots which brought uncertainty to PK parameter estimation. However, the VPCs plots indicated that the prediction performance of the final model was good.

The reviewer's goodness-of-fit plots by study are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure  5.1-3</ref>. As indicated, a lot of elagolix concentrations, especially those on high values were underestimated.</p></div>

Data: Elagolix exposure (average plasma concentration [C avg ] or concentration at pre-dose in repeated dosing [C trough ]) and clinical response variables (primary endpoints: DYS and NMPP) was evaluated using data from four Phase 3 studies: Studies M12-665, M12-667, M12-671, and M12-821. A combined dataset for primary endpoints was generated. The dataset included subject identification number, demographic variables, covariates, drug exposure variables (C avg and C trough ), and clinical response variables. Elagolix pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated from the population pharmacokinetic model and were used to provide elagolix exposure variables (C avg or C trough ) for the exposure-response analyses. Demographics of the subjects at baseline in the ER analysis is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 6</ref>.1-1. Exposure-Response Modeling: The exposure-response models for the clinical endpoints were built using non-linear mixed-effects modeling based on NONMEM 7.3 compiled with the GNU Fortran compiler <ref type="bibr">(Version 4.8.3)</ref>. The relationship between elagolix exposure and clinical outcome (DYS or NMPP response) was described by a discrete-time Markov Chain model. A schematic of the model is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 6</ref>.1-1. The model included a first-order Markovian feature which implies that the probabilities for subjects being in the responder or nonresponder states at each study visit are conditioned on their state at the previous visit. Equations to describe the process were as followed:</p><p>Where And E max01 is the maximum probability (in logit scale) of achieving the transition from nonresponder state to the responder state. EC5001 is the elagolix monthly C avg for half-maximal probability (in logit scale) of achieving the transition from nonresponder state to the responder state. C avg is the elagolix monthly average of daily C avg .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exposure-Efficacy Analyses of Primary Endpoints (DYS and NMPP):</head><p>A discrete-time first-order Markov Chain model was built to describe exposure-response between elagolix monthly average exposure (monthly C avg values) and transition probabilities between responder and nonresponder states. The estimated parameters values, covariates effect values and the variabilities from the final model are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 6</ref>.1-2. Model Evaluation: The final model was evaluated with goodness-of-fit plots, VPCs and bootstrap evaluation. The observed and predicted DYS and NMPP are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 6.1-3</ref>, the VPC plot are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 6.1-2</ref>, and the bootstrap results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 6</ref>.1-3.  Reviewer's Comments: Dose frequency such as QD and BID for the same daily dose has an effect on treatment response, therefore using C avg as exposure metric may confound the ER relationship for both DYS and NMPP. The model-predicted treatment effect does not match well with that observed in the studies. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 6.1-3</ref>, the proportions of responders for both DYS and NMPP at higher quantile of C avg were underestimated. Therefore, the ER-for efficacy may not adequately describe with the model.</p><p>Based on observations, the treatment response has reached a plateau after 4-6 months of treatment for both DYS and NMPP.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives:</head><p>The objectives of this report are: 1) To describe the relationship between elagolix exposure and changes in BMD and occurrence of hot flush 2) To identify patient covariates associated with changes in BMD, and occurrence of hot flush 3) Predict BMD changes following different elagolix treatment scenarios Data: The relationship between elagolix exposure and safety outcomes was evaluated using data from four Phase 3 studies: Studies M12-665, M12-667, M12-671 and M12-821. Data from 1684 premenopausal female subjects were included in the exposure-safety analysis for BMD. Data from 1685 subjects in pivotal studies M12-665 and M12-671 were included in the exposure-safety analysis for hot flush.</p><p>Covariates investigated for influence on the BMD included:</p><p>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">8.3</ref>). The structure model is an indirect response model that describes the changes from baseline BMD (BLBMD) and assumes a baseline steady state between bone formation and resorption. Some equations used to describe the model is as followed:</p><p>where dR(t)/dt is the change in BMD over time, Kin is a zero-order rate constant reflecting bone formation, Kout is a first-order rate constant reflecting bone resorption, BMD (t) is the BMD at time (t), and R (t) is the change in BMD from baseline (BLBMD) at time (t). Baseline BMD was modelled as a typical value for the population with its associated interindividual variability, and a different baseline value was estimated for each type of DXA scan machine (Hologic and Lunar) used. The effects of elagolix on BMD were modeled using a stimulatory Emax function on the bone resorption(Kout), as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">Equation 7</formula><p>where, Emax is the elagolix maximum stimulatory effect on Kout, EC 50 is the elagolix monthly average concentration producing 50% of maximum stimulation, and HILL is the stimulatory Emax curve shape factor.</p><p>Covariate Selection: Relationships between individual model parameter estimates and possible covariates were first explored using graphical methods, and then final covariate selection was performed using the forward inclusion and backward elimination procedures. The resulting model after backward elimination is referred to as the final NONMEM model.

As such, the reviewer supports the use of 150 mg QD in all subjects but does not recommend the use of 200 mg BID for more than six months. A logistic Emax model was able to describe the relationship between Elagolix and rate of hot flushes well. Higher elagolix was associated with increased incidence of hot-flushes. This is expected as elagolix suppress E2. Alcohol intake may increase the probability of hot flushes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives</head><p>To assess whether the presence of variants in OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 gene that have been previously associated with functional impact affects a subject's exposure to elagolix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Elagolix is metabolized via multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, with the applicant reporting CYP3A4 as the major contributor and CYP2D6 and CYP2C8 to a lesser extent. Elagolix is a substrate of the efflux transporter, p-glycoprotein (P-gp) and the uptake transporter, organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1. The applicant evaluated the influence of OATP1B1 genotype status on the exposure to elagolix by conducting SLCO1B1 (the gene encoding the OATP1B1 transporter protein) genotyping in subjects from 19 Phase 1 clinical studies (17 in healthy women and 2 in female subjects with renal or hepatic impairment) and 4 Phase 3 studies in female subjects with moderate to severe endometriosis-associated pain (2 pivotal studies and their extension studies). The applicant has submitted a pharmacogenetics report providing descriptive statistics of the population genotyped, the number of samples analyzed, phenotypic classifications of alleles and distribution of phenotypes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Per protocols of the clinical trials in the submission, one 4 mL whole blood sample was collected for DNA isolation prior to study drug dosing on Day 1 from each subject who consented to provide a sample for pharmacogenetic analysis. The applicant performed DNA extraction from whole blood using Qiagen reagent kits (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) applied to an automated DNA extraction instrument, AutoGeneprep 3000. According to the applicant's report, genotypes were determined via pyrosequencing using an in-house assay. The applicant determined genotype for a single nucleotide polymorphism in SLCO1B1.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 3</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_124">Table 4</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>of RD161306 report</head><p>Reviewer's Comments Published literature More than 45 nonsynonymous SNPs have been identified in SLCO1B1, few of which have been associated with impaired hepatic uptake, clearance and toxicity of statins. A notable common variant, 521T&gt;C (rs4149056), results in reduced membrane expression and transport activity and occurs with an allele frequency of 8-20% in Caucasians, 1-8% in African Americans and 8-16% in Asians. Additionally, the 388A&gt;G variant (rs23062830) has been associated with potentially reduced transport activity and is observed with an allele frequency of 30-45% in Caucasians, 72-83% in African Americans and 59-89% in Asians 2 . These two variants exist in partial linkage disequilibrium and form distinct haplotypes *1A (388A/521T), *1B (388G/521T), *5 (388A/521C) and *15(388G/521C) 3 . The low transport activity haplotypes, *5 and *15, have a combined frequency of approximately 15-20% in Europeans, 10-15% in Asians and 2% in sub-Saharan Africans 4 .</p><p>Reviewer's analysis While there are other variants in SLCO1B1 with functional implications on the OATP1B1 transporter, the applicant genotyped for the rs4149056 SNP to determine the transporter phenotype. Given the single SNP genotyping, it is plausible that the designation of subjects will also include definite *15 haplotypes; however, this does not impact the phenotypic assignment derived from the genotype. The determination of rs4149056 genotype is consistent with conventional assignment of the *5 haplotype 4 . The assignment of transporter phenotype by homozygous variant, heterozygous, and homozygous wild type for poor, intermediate and extensive transporters, respectively, is consistent with diplotype-phenotype assignments in the literature where 1) extensive transport is defined by homozygous wild-type for the extensive transport haplotypes, 2) intermediate transport is defined by heterozygous for the low activity haplotype, and 3) poor transport is defined by homozygous or compound heterozygous for the low transport haplotypes 5,6 .</p><p>Re-analysis of the assigned phenotype is consistent with the analysis performed by the applicant.</p><p>Applicant designation (CPIC-consensus term <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">7</ref>  The applicant did not assess genetic variation in elagolix-metabolizing enzymes, CYP3A4, and the highly polymorphic CYP2D6, and the impact of such variation on the exposure, safety and efficacy of elagolix.</p><p>The applicant did not include all genotyped samples in the popPK study.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Brief Discussion of Nonclinical Findings</head><p>Proposed clinical use:</p><p>The proposed dosing for elagolix is 150 mg QD or 200 mg BID in women with endometriosis. As of this writing, the proposed maximum duration of use for the high dose is , but may be further restricted by the clinical team to 6 months. For purposes of calculating multiples of exposure (MOEs) compared to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), the human Cmax value used is for a single 200 mg dose: 774 ng/mL (1.2 uM). The human AUC for a single 200 mg dose is 1725 ng.hr/mL. This value is doubled to reflect the BID dosing and to give the approximate exposure over 24 hrs: 3450 ng.hr/mL (5.5 uM.hr), which is the value used for comparison to daily animal dosing.</p><p>Characterization of the drug substance: Impurities The elagolix drug substance has a very large number of impurities that have structural alerts for genotoxicity, which led to an extensive program of impurity testing (reviewed under IND 64802; see reviews dated 11/22/2017 and 12/19/2017 by this reviewer). Some compounds were tested using a non-standard 6-well Ames format that was deemed acceptable. During review, particular attention was paid by this reviewer to verifying that testing was sufficient to rule out false negatives. Consultation with the CMC reviewer verified that impurities are controlled to appropriate levels. Qualification of specified impurities was achieved in repeat-dose tox studies, and in a special 6-week dietary study in the rat using spiked feed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adequacy of the nonclinical development program:</head><p>The pharmacology and toxicology of elagolix was characterized in a standard full nonclinical development program. The pivotal safety pharmacology and repeat dose tox studies were conducted in rat and dog. Reprotox studies were conducted in rat and rabbit, and standard 2 year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mouse and rat.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacology:</head><p>The mechanism of action of elagolix is antagonism at the GnRH receptor. Elagolix binds reversibly with very high affinity to the human GnRH receptor (Kd = 54 pM) and inhibited GnRH action in vitro in functional assays with Ki values in the low nM range (1.5, 2.8 nM). The rank order of binding across species is: human &gt; monkey ~ rabbit &gt;&gt;&gt; rat. There were no binding studies conducted against the dog GnRH receptor. Functional assays demonstrated activity at the rabbit, monkey, and human GnRH receptors. Binding of elagolix to the GnRH receptor suppresses LH and FSH secretion and subsequently reduces production of sex steroid production by the ovaries or testes. Pain associated with endometriosis is ameliorated in women by reduced proliferation of endometrial tissue subsequent to lowering circulating estrogens.</p><p>Efficacy of elagolix was not assessed in nonclinical species for several reasons:</p><p>(1) there are no animal models of endometriosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(2)</ref> binding of elagolix to the GnRH receptor in nonclinical species was weak (rat, rabbit) or not characterized (dog, mouse) (3) sufficient exposure could not be achieved with repeat dosing (monkey)</p><p>Receptor-mediated pharmacological effects were largely absent in nonclinical species. These included (when they were measured) reductions in LH, FSH, estrogen or testosterone, or changes in reproductive organs that would be expected from prolonged reductions in sex steroids. The clinical endpoint of bone mineral density was not measured in any nonclinical species. It should be kept in mind that toxicity that might result from prolonged reduction of sex steroids could not be reliably assessed in nonclinical studies for this drug due to low affinity of elagolix at the GnRH receptor in the nonclinical species and thus a lack of receptor-mediated pharmacological effects. However, the pivotal nonclinical studies are deemed sufficient to evaluate non-receptor-mediated or off-target effects of elagolix treatment.</p><p>There were no findings in a screen of 100 receptors for off-target binding of elagolix.</p><p>Safety pharmacology studies were conducted in rat and monkey at adequate multiples of exposure (&gt;20) and were negative. In agreement with nonclinical findings, a clinical thorough QT study was negative for arrhythmia risk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ADME:</head><p>The pharmacokinetics of elagolix were determined in CD-1 mice, SD rats, Beagle dogs and cynomolgus monkeys. In vivo absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) studies were conducted in rat and dog with radiolabeled compound and compared to absorption, metabolism and excretion studies conducted with [ 14 C]elagolix in humans.</p><p>The pharmacokinetic profile of elagolix was generally characterized by rapid absorption, high plasma clearance, moderate volumes of distribution and a short elimination half-life in mouse, dog and monkey. Bioavailability ranged from ~10% (mouse and monkey) to 100% (dog). Human and rat had similar bioavailability (~50%). Protein binding ranged from 78-90% across species.</p><p>Distribution after oral dosing was primarily to the GI tract. Elagolix did not cross the blood brain barrier, did not accumulate in pigmented tissue, and did not partition into red blood cells. It did, however, freely cross the placenta (assessed in the rat).</p><p>Elagolix is not extensively metabolized, circulating primarily as unchanged drug in plasma and remaining largely intact through clearance. Metabolic pathways were similar across species (including humans). There were no major metabolites in any species (although M14 and M15 were borderline major in the rat), and no unique human metabolites. Importantly, there were six active metabolites. The two most significant were NBI-61962 (M3), the Odesmethyl metabolite, and NBI-54058 (M6x), the N-dealkylated metabolite. M3 has a binding affinity comparable to elagolix, and M6X has a 6-fold higher affinity. These NDA 210450</p><p>Reviewer: Leslie McKinney, PhD 5 metabolites were monitored throughout the nonclinical development program and were verified to remain below 10% of parent across species.</p><p>Clearance of elagolix was primarily via the fecal route. Excretion into milk was not determined.</p><p>In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated the following potentially clinically relevant interactions of elagolix with metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters: elagolix is a substrate for CYP3A, PgP and OATP1B1, a weak to moderate inducer of CYP3A and 2B6, and an inhibitor of Pgp and OATP1B1 and 1B3.</p><p>In vitro metabolism studies were conducted with the two active metabolites, M3 (NBI-61692) and M6x (NBI-54048). The most significant potential effect was inhibition of CYP3A4/5, 2C9, and 2C19 by M6x. However, concentrations of this metabolite would have to reach micromolar levels for inhibition to become significant, which is not clinically relevant.</p><p>Toxicokinetics of elagolix were similar in mouse, rat, dog, and human. Exposure was proportional or somewhat greater than proportional to dose, there were no strong gender differences, and there was no evidence of accumulation. Toxicokinetics were strikingly different in rabbit and monkey. In the rabbit, repeat dosing in the dose range of &lt;300 mg/kg led to dramatic increases in exposure that were not associated with accumulation. In the monkey, repeat dosing led to a dramatic reduction in exposure that was unexplained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Toxicology:</head><p>Single and repeat-dose toxicology studies were conducted in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, and monkey. The SD rat and Beagle dog were chosen for the pivotal repeat-dose toxicology studies based on the ability to achieve higher systemic exposures when compared to mouse and monkey. However, as was previously discussed, affinity of elagolix for the rat GnRH receptor was poor (~1000-fold less compared to human), and receptor affinity in the dog was not measured.</p><p>In the rat, elagolix would have to reach free concentrations in the range of 12 uM (Cmax = 7740 ng/mL) to fully inhibit the GnRH receptor. The highest plasma concentration (Cmax) seen in the rat was at a single dose of 2000 mg/kg (~60 uM or ~6 uM free). For that reason, the toxicities revealed in the rat pivotal studies should generally be interpreted as being nonreceptor-mediated. The toxicities revealed in the dog pivotal studies, given the absence and/or lack of characterization of expected pharmacodynamic effects, should also be interpreted as possibly being non-receptor mediated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Single dose studies:</head><p>Single dose toxicity studies were conducted in rat and monkey at the same doses: 300, 600, 1200, or 2000 mg/kg, with ~4-fold higher exposures achieved in the monkey than the rat per unit dose. NOAELs were 300 mg/kg for both species, but MTDs diverged, being set at the low dose for the monkey and the high dose for the rat.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeat-dose studies:</head><p>A significant feature of the repeat-dose studies that complicated interpretation of the results was mortality that was apparently related to the drug formulation and not the toxicity of elagolix itself. In the rat 2-week study, there was ~50% mortality at the high dose (1200 mg/kg/d) that was attributed to gavage error or aspiration of the dose that resulted in ulcerative tracheitis/ bronchitis. The subsequent repeat-dose studies <ref type="bibr">(6, 13, and 26-week)</ref> reduced the high dose to 600 mg/kg/d but still had significant dose-related mortality NDA 210450</p><p>Reviewer: Leslie McKinney, PhD 6 (sometimes &gt;50% at the high dose). The main clinical sign was respiratory distress with confirmatory histological findings in the trachea and bronchii.</p><p>In the dog, mortality associated with dosing error/aspiration of test article was observed in both the 6-week (high dose 300 mg/kg/d) and 26-week (high dose 150 mg/kg/d) studies, and led the sponsor to reformulate the drug as a capsule for 9-month study. In that study, a high dose of 150 mg/kg/d was administered without mortality.</p><p>If it is accepted that mortality in the repeat-dose studies was likely due to aspiration leading to respiratory toxicity, the overall toxicity profile of elagolix is fairly benign and is summarized below by species.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RAT:</head><p>In the rat, the highest dose administered in the 6, 13, and 26-week studies was 600 mg/kg/d. The NOAEL decreased with increasing duration in each study, from 600 to 300 to 100 mg/kg/d; exposures corresponded to 19, 11, and 2-fold the MRHD, respectively. There were no new toxicities in the 26-week studies that had not appeared in the shorter duration studies. In fact, liver toxicity, which manifested in the 13-week study as increased liver weight (up to 45%), mild hepatocellular hypertrophy, and elevated enzymes (&lt;3-fold) at the high dose, were not reported in the 26-week study. Inconsistent changes in adrenal weights in the shorter duration studies were not repeated in the 26-week studies. Elevations in platelets and reticulocytes observed in shorter duration studies were also not observed in the 26-week study.</p><p>Estradiol and testosterone levels were assessed in the 6-week study and, unsurprisingly, were found to be highly variable. For that reason, the sponsor did not attempt to draw any conclusions about the effect of elagolix on sex hormone levels in the rat.</p><p>Studies by the dietary route were conducted at 6, 15, and 28 week durations. These studies were conducted to qualify impurities, determine dose-ranging for carcinogenicity studies, and bridge from the liquid formulation. The highest dose administered in these studies was 800 mg/kg/d. As expected, exposures by the dietary route were less than by oral gavage for a given dose. However, maximum exposures still reached ~9-fold the human MRHD.</p><p>A unique adverse finding in the 28-week dietary study was reported: focal degeneration / necrosis localized to the limiting ridge of the glandular stomach at both of the test doses (600 and 800 mg/kg/d). Erosion, inflammation, ulceration, and hyperplasia were noted, and it was suggested that this finding might explain hematology findings of minimally lower Hb and Hct, and mildly elevated white blood cell counts. In the 2-year carcinogenicity study (top dose 800 mg/kg/d), dose-dependent erosion and hyperkeratosis were noted in the stomach. The limiting ridge is a structure unique to the rat, and microscopic findings in the stomach were not noted in other species. Relevance to human is therefore low.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DOG:</head><p>In the dog, the highest dose administered in the 6 and 26 week studies by gavage was 300 mg/kg/d, and the NOAELs were similar: 50, and 75 mg/kg/d, respectively. Exposures were higher than in the rat per unit dose, and reached an MOE of 23 based on AUC at the higher NOAEL. However, continuing problems with aspiration of the liquid formulation led to the sponsor to reformulate elagolix as a capsule for the pivotal 9-month study. The NOAEL in the longer duration study was 30 mg/kg/d (MOE = 8).</p><p>The pattern of toxicity in the dog was similar to the rat. Body weights were reduced ~20% for both males and females at the high dose. There were reactive changes in the liver that NDA 210450</p><p>Reviewer: Leslie McKinney, PhD 7 were reflected in elevated ALP <ref type="bibr">(7.5-fold max)</ref> and increased organ weight. There were mild reductions in Hb and Hct and slight elevations in white blood cells. Relative spleen weight was reduced, but there were no corresponding histological findings. There was gall bladder irritation at the high dose that recovered.</p><p>The only pharmacodynamic signal in the dog was reduced prostate weight in the 9-month study (up to 56% at the high dose that did not recover). Estradiol and testosterone levels were assessed in the 6 and 26-week studies, and no treatment-related effects were noted. Testosterone values were highly variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MONKEY:</head><p>Use of the monkey as a nonclinical model for the action of elagolix was limited due to unusual toxicokinetics in this species. Repeat-dosing in the monkey led to a very rapid reduction in exposure, the cause of which was not explained by the sponsor. Two, 6, and 13-week studies were conducted in the monkey using the liquid formulation by oral gavage. The NOAEL for all three studies was the same: 300 mg/kg/d. MOEs were calculated based on exposure at day 1, since exposure fell off by ~50% within 2 weeks of dosing and continued to fall. At the NOAEL, the highest MOE based on AUC was 49.</p><p>Findings included modestly increased liver and kidney weights that did not have corresponding histology, were reversible, and so were considered reactive and not adverse. At the highest dose tested (600 mg/kg/d), the thymus showed involution and atrophy. An ECG study was conducted in the 13-week study that was negative, but this finding is not useful since it was conducted at the end of the study when exposures were low.</p><p>There was a pharmacodynamic signal of atrophy in the uterus, cervix, and vagina in the 6week study. No effects were noted in sex organs of the males, but the sponsor considered the male animals to be sexually immature. Estradiol and testosterone levels were assessed and found to be highly variable. For that reason, the sponsor did not attempt to draw any conclusions about the effect of elagolix on sex hormone levels in the monkey.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genotoxicity / Carcinogenicity:</head><p>Elagolix was found not genotoxic by the standard battery of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests. Carcinogenicity was evaluated in 2-year studies in the mouse and rat by the dietary route. Elagolix was found not carcinogenic in the mouse. In the rat, liver and thyroid neoplasms were observed that were deemed species specific. The potential for carcinogenic risk in humans is thus deemed to be negligible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reproductive toxicity:</head><p>Fertility and early embryonic development was evaluated in the rat at doses of 30, 150, and 300 mg/kg/d. There was mortality in this study that followed the pattern of the repeat dose toxicity studies, that is, with signs of aspiration and respiratory distress. Treatment with elagolix had no effect on reproductive parameters (estrous cycle, reproductive performance, sperm count, sperm motility, pregnancy rate, mating behavior) or observations at Cesarean section related to implantation or embryo-fetal viability. However, as discussed above, these negative findings are likely due to the low affinity of elagolix for the rat GnRH receptor.</p><p>The NOAEL for maternal and paternal effects was 50 mg/kg/day and the NOEL for reproductive performance, fertility, and embryo/fetal viability was ≥ 300 mg/kg/d. With respect to the AUC at the MRHD, the exposure multiple for women based on the AUC at the NOEL of 300 mg/kg/day for the fertility effects in the female rat is ~4. <ref type="bibr">6-fold. However, the NDA 210450</ref> Reviewer: Leslie McKinney, PhD 8 sponsor calculated that, when adjusted for the difference in affinity of elagolix for the rat and human GnRH receptor, this exposure multiple translates to 0.007-fold. Thus, this fertility study is not informative for human risk arising from intended or exaggerated pharmacology.</p><p>Teratogenicity of elagolix was evaluated in the rat and the rabbit. There was a striking difference between the rat and the rabbit in the ability to tolerate dosing, possibly due to the large difference in affinity of elagolix for the rat vs the rabbit GnRH receptor (low vs. moderate), and/or possibly due to a striking increase in exposure that occurred in the rabbit with repeat dosing. In both rat and rabbit, dose range finding studies were conducted using the liquid formulation by oral gavage to establish the doses for the definitive study. Rats were dosed from GD6-GD17 up to 1200 mg/kg/d and rabbits were dosed from GD7-GD20 up to 600 mg/kg/d. Pregnant rat dams tolerated dosing well but pregnant rabbit dams did not; there was a high rate of mortality and abortion which led to a low and very limited dose range being set for the definitive study.</p><p>In the rat, an embryofetal development (EFD) study was successfully completed using doses of 300, 600, and 1200 mg/kg/d. The NOEL for both maternal toxicity and fetal viability and growth was set at the low dose, based on unscheduled deaths in the dams (likely due to aspiration of the test article) and decreased fetal weight and increased postimplantation loss (likely due to reduced feed consumption and body weight loss in the dams). There were no treatment-related external, visceral, or skeletal findings, so the NOAEL for fetal teratogenicity was set at the high dose. Elagolix was shown in distribution studies to freely cross the placental barrier, so it can be assumed that fetuses were fully exposed to the drug. This study was useful for evaluating teratogenicity of elagolix to the developing fetus that was independent of changes in estrogen or progesterone. Using rat AUC values obtained on GD17 compared to the AUC at the MRHD of 3.5 ug.hr/mL, at 300 mg/kg/day, the MOE is 6.5 and at 1200 mg/kg/day, the MOE is 39.4.</p><p>In the rabbit, the definitive EFD study was conducted at lower does than in the rat, and was conducted over a very limited dose range <ref type="bibr">(100, 150, and 200 mg/kg/d)</ref>. Exposures at the high dose in this study were roughly comparable to exposures at the low dose in the rat EFD study. There was significant maternal and fetal toxicity at the high dose, as reflected in mortality, abortion, and reduced fetal weight. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was thus set at the mid dose (MOE = 6.6). One mid-dose and one high-dose dam had litters with no viable fetuses, which resulted in an increase in post-implantation loss at those two doses. Based on these findings plus reduced fetal weight, the NOEL for embryofetal toxicity was considered by the reviewer to be the low dose (MOE = 2.7). Fetal external, visceral, and skeletal examinations were negative, indicating no teratogenic effects of elagolix. The NOEL for teratogenicity was set at the high dose (MOE = 11.6).</p><p>Taken together, the results from the rat and rabbit EFD studies are informative for human teratogenic risk. Exposures were achieved that were greater than the exposures expected at the MRHD and because elagolix crosses the placental barrier, fetuses can assume to have been exposed. Elagolix was found negative for teratogenicity in both species.</p><p>However, the EFD studies are less informative for risk of early pregnancy loss in humans. In the rat, hormones necessary for maintenance of pregnancy were likely not affected, so the lack of effect of elagolix on litter viability does not translate to the human. In the rabbit, the species that is more sensitive to the pharmacological action of elagolix, it was concerning that that there were single instances of total litter loss at both the mid and high doses. The sponsor has recognized that an effect of elagolix on pregnancy maintenance in the human cannot be ruled out, and appropriately contraindicates its use during pregnancy. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>At 1 Hz, there was a dose-dependent reduction in the maximum rate of depolarization (13, 24, and 33% at 5, 10, and 50 uM respectively). There were similar dose-dependent decreases at 0.5 and 3 Hz that did not reach statistical significance.</p><p>At the low dose, there was a small inverse frequency-dependent increase in action potential duration (APD) that was even less pronounced at 5 and 10 uM.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Toxicokinetics</head><p>Over the long course of development of elagolix, a large number of TK studies were done across the various nonclinical species. For ease of review, the sponsor collated the major results from each species and presented most of them graphically (See RD150352). Briefly, this section summarizes studies that addressed the following aspects of dosing on TK parameters: formulation, gender, dose proportionality, and accumulation with repeat dosing. Human TK is given at the end of this section for comparison.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formulation</head><p>Studies were conducted to evaluate the contribution of salt form and formulation (various aqueous vehicles, diet, or tablet) on the TK profile. Because the aqueous formulation was associated with mortality in the rodent -presumably due to aspiration and subsequent respiratory toxicity -the sponsor had to develop different formulations in order to successfully complete the long-duration tox studies. Selected results from these studies are summarized below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Salts</head><p>Various salt forms of elagolix were assessed for TK in mouse, rat, and dog. There were minimal differences in exposure between the salt forms. Given the similarities in exposures between salts, the sodium salt was utilized for most of the long term definitive toxicology studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formulation</head><p>Various aqueous vehicles tested in mouse and rat will not be detailed here other than to note that exposures were comparable to each other and equal to or greater than exposures when corn oil was used as vehicle. More important were the studies characterizing dietary administration in the rat and mouse, and tablet formulation in the dog, since those are the formulations used in the long duration studies.</p><p>Gavage vs diet: AUCs from gavage dosing were ~2-3-fold higher than from administration in the diet in the rat and mouse. No gender differences were noted. Mouse: Exposures after repeated daily dosing were comparable to those obtained at the beginning of the study in CD-1 mice.</p><p>Rat: In SD rats, the AUC after repeat dosing tended to remain unchanged at low doses (&lt; 300 mg/kg), increased up to 3.5-fold after high doses (300 to 600 mg/kg) and decreased up to 68% after very high doses (1,200 mg/kg or above).</p><p>Rabbit: Exposures were 3-11-fold higher after multiple dosing in NZ white rabbits.</p><p>Dog: In the dog, the AUCs were comparable following up to 39 weeks of daily dosing up to 150 mg/kg; however, some exceptions were noted, particularly at high doses (≥ 150 mg/kg), where as much as a 5.4-fold increase in AUC was observed in the 6-week and 26-week studies. Monkey: In contrast, AUCs were nearly 10-fold lower after multiple dosing in cynomolgus monkeys. This decline occurred early in the study, with AUCs on Day 42 comparable to those measured on Day 91 in the 13-week study. The sponsor stated that the observed decrease in AUCs in monkey with multiple dosing did not appear to be caused by liver CYP enzyme induction, but did not provide data for an explanation. Because of the marked decline in AUC following multiple dosing in the monkey, it was not selected as the non-rodent species for toxicology studies. General Toxicology</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key Study Findings</head><p>There was significant dose-related mortality ascribed to respiratory distress secondary to aspiration of the test article. Treatment-related clinical observations included decreased activity and respiratory distress which included rales, gasping, wheezing, salivation and shallow respiration. Histopathology findings (inflammation) in the bronchii and trachea supported the inference of aspiration of drug as a cause of respiratory distress.</p><p>Based on mortality, histopathologic changes and clinical signs of respiratory distress observed at 300 mg/kg/day, the NOAEL was set at 100 mg/kg/day. On Day 182, exposure at this dose level was Cmax and AUC last equal to 1,730 ng/ml and 7,720 ng*hr/ml, respectively in the males, and Cmax and AUC last equal to 2,050 ng/ml and 6,540 ng*hr/ml, respectively for females. Lungs had dark discoloration and were mottled in 0, 1, 0, 5 and 6 rats, respectively. Foamy pale material or foamy or watery clear fluid in the tracheal lumen of a few preterminal animals at 300 mg/kg/day (Group 4) and 600 mg/kg/day (Group 5) were correlated with the tracheal inflammation/fibrin accumulation in the tracheal lumen. Histopathology was centered on respiratory system. Tracheal changes in the found-dead animals (2 main females at 300 mg/kg/day, 2 main male and 5 main females at 600 mg/kg/day) were characterized by acute inflammation of the tracheal mucosa and/or necrosis of the tracheal epithelium and /or fibrin accumulation in the tracheal lumen, with or without hemorrhage of the tracheal mucosa, atrophy of the tracheal epithelium and hyperplasia/ hypertrophy of the tracheal epithelium.</p><p>In animals that were pre-terminally sacrificed (1 main female at 300 mg/kg/day and 5 males at 600 mg/kg/day), findings were characterized by inflammation of the tracheal mucosa and/or necrosis (or atrophy/necrosis) of the tracheal epithelium and/or fibrin accumulation in the tracheal lumen, with or without atrophy of tracheal epithelium and hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the tracheal epithelium. The sponsor suggested that tracheal changes were initiated by regurgitated / refluxed stomach contents, which may be partially supported by the gaseous dilatation of the stomach in some rats.</p><p>Bronchial changes, including acute necrotizing inflammation of the bronchiolar lining and fibrin accumulation in the larger bronchial lumens, with or without atrophy/necrosis and hyperplasia/ hypertrophy of bronchiolar epithelium, were noted in pre-terminally sacrificed rats (1 F at 50 mg/kg/day, 1 F at 300 mg/kg/day. 1 M and 3 F at 600 mg/kg/day) and in found-dead animals (1 M and 1 F at 300 mg/kg/day, 1 M and 4 F at 600 mg/kg/day). These findings were considered an extension of the tracheal changes in the preterminal rats.</p><p>The sponsor considered tracheobronchial inflammation or bronchial inflammation as the probable cause of death for most found-dead animals and tracheobronchial inflammation with fibrin accumulation as the main change responsible for the deteriorating condition of the preterminally sacrificed animals.</p><p>Pulmonary changes (intra-alveolar homogenous eosinophilic material, intra-alveolar histiocytosis, congestion, septal/interstitial edema, intra-alveolar hemorrhage) occurred at variable intensity and severity in preterminal animals from various NBI-56418-treated groups and were considered secondary to the tracheal and bronchial changes.</p><p>Treatment-related changes involving lymphoid tissue consisted of thymic cortical lymphoid atrophy, increased thymic cortical lymphoid single cell necrosis and splenic lymphoid atrophy of white pulp, noted at variable incidence and severity in preterminal rats from various NBI-56418treated groups were considered most likely reactions to the stress of experimentation. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key Study Findings</head><p>Clinical observations included soft/mucoid stools, diarrhea and decreased mean body weights and food consumption. There were test article-related effects on hematology, coagulation, and clinical chemistry parameters for males and females at the high dose. Decreased spleen weights were noted in males and females, which were persistent in recovery for males, but did not have histological correlates. There were decreased prostate weights in males, without histological correlates, that did not recover. Histopathological effects were noted in the gallbladders of males in the high dose group that were absent in recovery. Background for this study and dose justification (sponsor's text): 6 week study: The dose levels were selected to produce graded responses to the test article. NBI-56148 was administered to the Beagle dog at doses as high as 300 mg/kg for 6 weeks (oral gavage). The 300 mg/kg dose produced salivation, emesis, changes in feces, and decreased body weights (33% in males) and food consumption (up to 41%). Furthermore, the 300 mg/kg dose produced roughly a 3-fold increase in serum liver enzymes (ALT, AST and ALP). In addition, there was one mortality (female).</p><p>In a 6-month repeat dose study using oral gavage, the highest dose tested was 150 mg/kg. At this dose, roughly a 2-fold increase in ALT in the males was observed. Additionally, mortality was observed (3/7 males) that was attributed to dosing error/aspiration. The 150 mg/kg dose was associated with salivation, emesis, and changes in feces.</p><p>Both of the above-mentioned studies used oral gavage solution, which led to dose aspiration; therefore, solid formulation was tested to assess if it provides a safer method to administer this compound. In a preliminary 28-day repeat administration of NBI-56418 tablets in capsules, dogs were administered up to 150 mg/kg/day. There were no mortalities reported in this study; however, body weights were decreased up to 17%.</p><p>The 150 mg/kg dose was chosen to represent the high dose where some toxic effects, but not excessive lethality was anticipated to allow meaningful interpretation of the data. The mid and low doses (30 and 10 mg/kg, respectively) were expected to provide multiples of the human exposure at an efficacious dose. The low-dose level was anticipated to produce a NOEL. Test materials were administered after the dogs had been offered food, since in a preliminary study this reduced the incidence of emesis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key Study Findings</head><p>There were essentially no findings other than occasional emesis after dosing. This study is of limited usefulness due to the rapid falloff in exposure with time (from previous studies ~ half at 2 weeks and more than two thirds at 6 weeks). In this study, plasma levels of NBI-56418 dropped a maximum of 59, 91, and 88% in animals treated at 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg/day, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key Study Findings</head><p>No statistically or biologically significant neoplastic findings related to NBI-56418 were found. A slightly higher, but not significant, incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in males at the high dose of 500 mg/kg/day was observed. In females, a dose-dependent trend of leiomyosarcoma in the cervix was noted. There was no pairwise significance. There were no significant findings of leiomyosarcoma in other tissues of the lower reproductive tract.</p><p>NBI-56418 did not alter the trend in mortality rates. The study achieved an MTD as the percent difference in body weight change (g) for the 500 mg/kg/day group (males and females) from controls was greater than 10% at Week 13 and at terminal necropsy.</p><p>The Week 26 AUC 0-t for NBI-56418 at the 500 mg/kg/day dose was 40.5 ug.hr/mL for males and 66.5 ug.hr/mL for females. This corresponds to an MOE of 12 and 19, respectively, as compared to the human AUC of 3.5 ug.hr/mL at the highest proposed therapeutic dose of 200 mg BID.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appropriateness of Test Models</head><p>Binding of elagolix to the GnRH receptor in the mouse was not characterized. It is known that elagolix binding to the GnRH receptor in two other rodent species (rat and rabbit) is significantly less potent (orders of magnitude) than in monkey or human. In addition, there were no obvious pharmacodynamic signs of drug activity (atrophy of reproductive organs in males or females; <ref type="table" target="#tab_88">Table of</ref> Macroscopic Observations p 141-142). We therefore assume for the purposes of this review that any elagolix toxicity is probably non-receptor mediated. ADME of elagolix was fully characterized in the mouse. Bioavailability is 9.6% (much less than human, which is ~52%) and protein binding was 78.5% (equal to human). Metabolites were not quantified but were identified. Confusingly, M6x (NBI 54048) was not identified in the mouse in vivo metabolite study, but was identified in this carci study.

Mortality was not treatment/dose related as survival at study termination (Week 103 or 104) was in the 33 to 45% range for all male study groups including the controls. The survival for the female control group was slightly higher (45%) than treated female groups (27 to 30%) but there were no statistically significant differences in survival rates among the treatment groups (i.e., there was no dose response), or between treatment and control groups in either males or females.</p><p>All surviving males (Groups 1 through 4) were sacrificed on Day 720 (at least 102 weeks), and all surviving females (Groups 1 through 4) were sacrificed on Day 728 (104 weeks).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key Study Findings</head><p>NBI-56418 administered via diet at dose levels of 150, 300, and 800 mg/kg/day resulted in reduction in survival of males at 300 and 800 mg/kg/day (33.3 and 31.7%, respectively). However, adequate number of animals survived in all dose groups to provide a valid study for statistical analysis. Survival was unaffected in females.</p><p>The highest target dose of 800 mg/kg/day was associated with increased incidences of hepatic (males) and thyroid tumors (males and females) that were likely a rat-specific effect and were predominantly benign. No correlation was observed between survival and tumors.</p><p>The study achieved an MTD as the percent difference in body weight change (g) for the high dose group (M and F) was greater than 10% at terminal necropsy. Mean body weights were 17 and 13% lower than control for females and males, respectively.</p><p>The Week 26 AUC 0-t for NBI-56418 at the 800 mg/kg/day dose was 43.3 ug.hr/mL for males and 45.4 ug.hr/mL for females. This corresponds to an MOE of 12.4 and 13, respectively, as compared to the human AUC of 3.5 ug.hr/mL at the highest proposed therapeutic dose of 200 mg BID. Exposure to metabolites NBI-61962 (M3) and NBI-54048 (M6x) was minor.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adequacy of Carcinogenicity Study</head><p>An adequate number of rats survived an appropriate duration (i.e., at least to Week 101 of the dosing phase) to result in acceptable exposure to the test article for a valid evaluation of the carcinogenic potential of NBI-56418 (see correspondence from ECAC dated June 21 2011 and SDN May 1 2011 with protocol amendment). There was sufficient histopathological data from the designated organs and tissues to evaluate both the non-neoplastic and neoplastic effects of NBI-56418 at all dose levels (and changes in control animals) for valid carcinogenicity evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appropriateness of Test Models</head><p>Binding of elagolix to the GnRH receptor in the rat is several orders of magnitude weaker than human. In addition, there were no obvious pharmacodynamic signs of drug activity (atrophy of reproductive organs in males or females; Table of Macroscopic Observations p 137-146). We therefore assume for the purposes of this review that any elagolix-related findings are nonreceptor mediated.</p><p>Bioavailability of elagolix in the rat and human are approximately the same (~52%). Protein binding is slightly greater in the rat (90.4%) than human (78.5%). Five minor metabolites, M2, M4b, M6, M10, and M17 that are present in humans were not detected in the in vivo metabolism study in the rat using radiolabeled elagolix.</p><p>The test model was deemed appropriate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation of Tumor Findings</head><p>Liver Increased incidences of hepatocyte hypertrophy were seen in males at 800 mg/kg/day and females at 300 or 800 mg/kg/day. The increase in numbers of liver tumors (hepatocellular adenomas and hepatocellular carcinomas) in males and eosinophilic foci in females were seen only at 800 mg/kg/day. Other findings included an increased incidence of hepatocyte hypertrophy in males and at 800 mg/kg/day and females at ≥ 300 mg/kg/day; hepatocyte cytoplasmic vacuolation and pigmentation in females at 800 mg/kg/day as well as bile duct hyperplasia in males at 800 mg/kg/day and in females at ≥ 150 mg/kg/day.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thyroid</head><p>At the high dose, there was an increase in the incidence of thyroid follicular cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) in males and females. Statistical significance was achieved only for adenomas. Increases in the incidence of thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy was evident at 300 (minimal) and 800 (minimal to slight) mg/kg/day dose levels in both males and females.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gut</head><p>At the high dose, 15 males had granulomatous inflammation, involving the ileum and/or jejunum and/or mesenteric lymph node and/or bile duct. The inflammation was characterized by numerous macrophages, including multinucleate cells. The granulomatous inflammation in the ileum and/or jejunum or other areas could be test article-related, but it did not seem to affect food consumption or general health significantly.</p></div>

Due to the potential for poor consumption of test article-treated diet, the dietary test article concentration (dose levels) for the mid-and high-dose levels was increased gradually over the first 1 or 2 weeks of the study. Frequency of dosing: daily Dose volume: N/A Route of administration: Oral diet Formulation/Vehicle: Basis of dose selection: Range-finding studies. 600 mg/kg/d was the NOAEL in the range-finding studies. The 800 mg/kg dose was likely the MTD based on reduced body weight gain. The exposure at 800 mg/kg results in at least 16-fold the upper limit of the therapeutic human exposure in females. Higher doses (&gt; 1200 mg/kg) resulted in decreased exposure at Weeks 8 and 15 presumably due to liver enzyme induction. The AUC 0-t at the 100 mg/kg/day dose is roughly equivalent to the expected therapeutic exposure (948 to 1581 ng⋅h/mL) and was deemed too low for the carci study.

Necropsy findings were remarkable in almost half of the unscheduled-death males and included mottled/discolored lungs, some with material in the thoracic cavity. None died on the day of initiation of treatment, but it is believed that these clinical observations and deaths are attributed to some undetermined characteristic of the dosing formulation (causing taste aversion) that resulted in the aspiration of the dose preparation into the lungs (i.e., excessive salivation produced by the dosing formulation resulting in aspiration of saliva leading to the respiratory signs [and the convulsions in the 300 mg/kg/day male], as well as clear discharge from the nose).</p><p>In an attempt to overcome this problem, the use of cherry syrup to coat the outside of the dosing needle was initiated to coincide with the third week of dosing in the males and the initiation of dose administration for the females.

Although the use of the cherry syrup helped alleviate the excessive salivation in the males, the problem was not completely alleviated in the females. Remarkable clinical signs included clear or discolored oral and/or nasal discharge immediately following dosing. Again, the incidence and severity of these finding increased with dose.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fertility Parameters (Mating/Fertility Index, Corpora Lutea, Preimplantation Loss, etc.)</head><p>The pregnancy rates were 100, 96, 95, and 89% for the 0 (control), 50, 150, and 300 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. The group mean sperm motility values were 96, 89, 80 and 85% for the 0 (control), 50, 150, and 300 mg/kg/day group, respectively with no statistically significant or biologically meaningful differences observed (Appendix 7). One male from each of the treated groups had remarkably low percent sperm motility values (i.e., 50 mg/kg/day male B04608, 0%; 150 mg/kg/day male B04640, 14%; and 300 mg/kg/day male B04677, 1%). No significant differences were observed in the epididymal sperm count data across groups.</p><p>Remarkable necropsy findings were observed only in the low dose male and were limited to small testes and epididymides; there were no remarkable necropsy findings for the other two males. All three males were confirmed to have mated with their female pair within the first three days of mating and the mating of both the mid and high dose males resulted in successful pregnancies with viable fetuses. The necropsy findings and the unsuccessful mating of the low dose male were not attributed to treatment with NBI-56418.</p><p>Reproductive indices 2.6.7.12 p 109 Tox Tabulated Summary There were no abortions or early deliveries. The mean number of corpora lutea, implantation sites, and preimplantation loss were generally similar across groups. A slight decrease in mean number of implantation sites and an increase in mean preimplantation loss were observed in the mid-dose group. This was due to a single female (B04792); although this female had 10 corpora lutea, it only had one implantation site. Effects were not noted at the higher dose level. Therefore, the slight differences in these two Caesarean section parameters were not attributed to treatment. The mean number of early resorptions (there were no late resorptions), mean postimplantation loss, and mean percent live fetuses were similar across groups, indicating NBI-56418 had no effects on embryo/fetal viability. A study on local tolerance of elagolix was submitted to IND 64802 but not to NDA 210450. This study was conducted in 2006 and reviewed by Dr. Raheja in 2007. His summary is given below.</p><p>Assessment of contact hypersensitivity to NBI-56418 (sodium salt) in the mouse (local lymph node assay). NBI Report No. 06-56418-008-TX. GLP. NBI-56418 lot No. 17BNo2.HQ00002).</p><p>Experimental design: Four groups of 5 female CBA mice were treated with vehicle (dimethyl formamide) or 10, 25, or 50% NBI-56418 on the dorsal surface of both ears at a dose of 25 ul/ear for 3 consecutive days. Three days after the last exposure, all animals were injected with 3 H-methyl thymidine and after 5 hours the draining (auricular) lymph nodes were excised. After precipitating the lymph node cells, radioactivity was measured and expressed as DPM. A stimulation index (SI) = ratio of DPM/treated group compared to DPM/vehicle control was calculated. An SI value of 3 or greater is regarded as a skin sensitizer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>There was no mortality, no systemic toxicity and no body weight changes.</p><p>Clinical observations: Erythema was noted for both ears of animals treated with 10 (2 of 5 animals), 25 (2 of 5 animals) and 50% (all animals) concentration of NBI-56418. No edema was observed. A majority of lymph nodes were normal in size except for one animal in the high dose which had enlarged lymph nodes.</p><p>DPM values: Mean DPM/animal values for the experimental groups treated with 10, 25, and 50% concentration of NBI-56418 were 243, 405, 307 and 619, respectively. The calculated SI values for NBI-56418 concentration of 10, 25, and 50% were 1.7, 1.3, and 2.5, respectively. NBI-56418 is thus regarded not a skin sensitizer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NDA 210450</head><p>Reviewer: Leslie McKinney, PhD 109 Dr. Raheja's review included the following comment: The mean DPM/animal of 619 in the 50% concentration group is based on the following 5 values: 977, 785, 597, 567 and 171. Apparently the last value does not belong to this group and if it is taken out, the mean will be 732 with decreased variation and SI value will exceed 3, suggesting that NBI-576418 at 50% concentration is a potential skin sensitizer.</p><p>This reviewer notes that the standard deviation on these 5 numbers was very high, and that there are no statistical criteria for excluding the low value. In addition, the study director concluded that the findings were negative, and the Division did not follow up with any further requests to characterize the potential for skin sensitization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phototoxicity Risk Evaluation:</head><p>The sponsor presented a risk evaluation for phototoxicity as follows:</p><p>(1) A distribution study of radiolabeled elagolix in the rat showed no accumulation in the pigmented part of the eye or skin. <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> The absorption spectrum for elagolix showed peaks at 201 and 274 nm (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_21">Table 19</ref> Section 2.6.6.8.7.1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</head><p>This Clinical Outcome Assessment (COA) review is provided as a response to a request for consultation by the Division of Bone, Reproductive, and Urologic Products (DBRUP) regarding NDA 210450. The Applicant (AbbVie Inc.) is seeking an FDA approval for elagolix sodium oral tablets for management of endometriosis with associated pain in adult female patients (≥18 years). The Applicant completed two phase 3, pivotal, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, multi-center, clinical trials to assess safety and efficacy of elagolix (Clinical Trials M12665 and M12671). The following select patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments were implemented in the phase 3 clinical trials: The Division had previously agreed on the acceptability of the eDiary before COA Staff consultation. Specifically, there was agreement that the DYS and NMPP scores was acceptable for use as a co-primary endpoint. Therefore, this review focused on whether the eDiary was fitfor-purpose in the context of this particular drug development program to assess endometriosis associated pain (menstrual and non-menstrual pain) in the target patient population. Of note, the Applicant is seeking marketing application approval and relevant PRO labeling claims. Refer to the NDA 210450, eCTD Module 1, for information on proposed prescribing information.</p><p>The submission did not include an evidence dossier describing the development of the eDiary. This review concludes the following based on face validity:</p><p>• The DYS, NMPP, DYSP, and NRS pain scales (part of the daily eDiary) measure the appropriate key symptoms of endometriosis and appear fit-for-purpose for this drug development program. • DYS, NMPP, DYSP, and NRS results from the M12665 and M12671 clinical trials appear to demonstrate clinical benefit in the target patient population.</p><p>This reviewer recommends using anchor-based methods as the primary approach supplemented with cumulative distribution function to derive specific threshold(s) to help interpret PRO data in future clinical trials. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">2</ref> Refer to the Clinical and Statistical reviews for additional relevant discussion and analysis of PRO measures and results.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">CLINICAL OUTCOME ASSESSMENT(S) Endometriosis Daily Pain Impact Scales (Endometriosis eDiary):</head><p>The Endometriosis eDiary included the following assessments: (1) Dysmenorrhea (DYS); (2) Non-Menstrual Pelvic Pain (NMPP); (3) Dyspareunia Assessment (DYSP); (4) overall endometriosis-associated pain on the numeric rating scale (NRS); (5) uterine bleeding; (3) time for study drug dosing; and (6) the use of allowed analgesic medications for endometriosis-associated pain. Refer to Appendix A for a copy of relevant pain and uterine bleeding scales included in the eDiary.</p><p>Prior Versions: There are no prior versions or user manuals provided by the Applicant.</p><p>User Manual: The Applicant did not provide a corresponding user manual for review. Timing, Data Collection Method, and Mode of Administration: The eDiary electronically administered daily at approximately same time using an ePRO device by patients until end of study period by Month 6 or at the time of premature discontinuation from the study.</p><p>Training method/materials: The Applicant provided training to patients and clinical investigators on eDiary administration.</p><p>The Applicant also administered the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) in both clinical trials to facilitate evaluation of meaningful change for pain scales included in the eDiary. The PGIC asks patients to evaluate the change in their endometriosis-associated pain since initiation of study drug by choosing 1 of 7 responses. The PGIC was administered monthly. Refer to Appendix B for a copy of the instrument.</p><p>Reviewer Comments: While PGIC is one anchor measure that may be useful to evaluate meaningful change for a PRO instrument of interest; however, this reviewer offers following considerations for anchor measures in future clinical development programs for endometriosis:</p><p>• Selected anchor(s) should be plainly understood in context, easier to interpret that the PRO itself, and sufficiently correlated to the target PRO. • Multiple anchors should be explored to provide an accumulation of evidence to help interpret meaningful within-patient score change which can also be a range. • The following anchors are recommended to generate appropriate improvement threshold(s) that represent a meaningful within-patient change in the target patient population:</p><p>o Well established clinical outcomes o Static, current-state global impression of severity scale (e.g., Patient Global Impression of Severity or PGIS) o Global impression of change scale (e.g., Patient Global Impression of Change or PGIC) • A static, current state global impression of severity scale is recommended at minimum, when appropriate, since these anchor measures such as PGIS are less likely to be subject to recall error than global impression of change such as PGIC. • Optimize the frequency and timing of anchor measure administration as appropriate.</p><p>For example, consider administering anchor measures at multiple time points throughout a clinical trial to maximize the amount of data available in both the investigational and control arms, particularly for patients who withdraw early.</p></div>

In contrast, for the 200 mg BID regimen, the mean R ac on Day 7 was 0.84 and</figDesc><table /><note>.4-1).0.79 in Japanese and Han Chinese subjects, respectively. A similar decrease in elagolix exposure was observed in White and Black subjects on Day 21 compared to that on Day 1 (Study M12-790). The decrease in elagolix exposure may be explained by the auto-induction of CYP3A, OATP1B1 and/or BCRP by high dose elagolix.</note></figure>

The neurobehavioral responses to orally administered elagolix were evaluated in a rat modified Irwin assay (functional observational battery) that was conducted doses of 30, 300 or 1200 mg/kg (n = 10/sex/dose). Satellite groups of 6/sex/dose were used for TK. There were no treatment-related effects. NOAEL = 1200 mg/kg. Systemic exposure at this dose level in the rat as measured by Cmax and AUC( 0-24 ) was 10.5 ug/mL and 133 ug*h/mL, respectively in the male, and 31.9 ug/mL and 202 ug*h/mL in the female. We note that the Pharmacology written summary gives Cmax at the NOAEL as 21.2 ug/mL, which is the average of the male and female exposures. The sponsor's table below gives exposure data for the parent compound NBI-56418 and primary metabolite NBI-61962 (M3). Elagolix and its primary metabolite, NBI-61692 (M3), were tested for their effects on potassium (hERG channel) and sodium currents. hERG channels were expressed in HEK cells, and native Na channels were assessed in rat primary neuronal cell cultures. There were no effects in the therapeutically relevant concentration range.

Elagolix affects the ovarian sex hormone cascade within hours of the first dose and has an elimination half-life of 4-6 hours. The shorter half-life as compared to other GnRH agonists is relevant, especially for patients experiencing adverse events, since the drug is eliminated within a week.

After reaching Cmax, elagolix concentrations decline in a biphasic fashion, with a t1/2 of ~4 to 6 hours.

Males showed 50% decreased food consumption at the high dose.MTD was set at 2000 mg/kg. NOAEL = 300 mg/kg. At this dose, the Cmax and AUC 0-24 values were 2.5 μg/mL and 22.8 μg•hr/mL, respectively.

MTD was based on mortality, body weight, food consumption, clinical observations, and clinical pathology recorded on Day 2. Gross pathology and organ weights were recorded on Day 4 at necropsy. Liver was examined microscopically.There was no mortality. Decreased food consumption was noted at the higher doses. Elevation in liver enzymes (ALT, AST) and total bilirubin was observed at all doses. ALT ↑ 1.2X -2.2X. AST (males only) ↑5.8X at 1200 mg/kg and 11.9X at 2000 mg/kg.

Kidney-associated clinical chemistry changes included increases in creatinine level of up to 2.8-fold (maximal) and BUN level of up to 1.9-fold (maximal) at 1200 mg/kg only. No changes were observed in gross pathology or organ weights. Hepatocellular centrilobular vacuolation consistent with microvesicular fatty changes was noted only in females at doses ≥ 600 mg/kg. The 300 mg/kg dose was considered the MTD and the NOAEL, since changes in clinical chemistry parameters including ALT, AST, total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and glucose were ≤ 2.5-fold. Cmax and AUC 0-24 at the NOAEL (using the sex with the lower mean values) was 10.2 μg/mL and 75.8 μg•hr/mL, respectively. Metabolite NBI-61962 was measured.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Rat: Study #RD101041 Dosing: 300, 600, 1200, or 2000 mg/kg elagolix Na salt in water, oral gavage, 10 mL/kg N = 3/sex/group SD rats MTD was based on mortality, body weight, food consumption, clinical observations, and clinical pathology observed on Day 2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives:</head><p>To assess the pharmacokinetics and safety/tolerability of elagolix when administered alone and in combination with ketoconazole in healthy premenopausal females</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology:</head><p>This was a Phase 1, single-dose, two-period, open-label, fasting study conducted following a sequential design ( Lastly, a pre-and post-natal development study was conducted in the rat, using the dietary route of administration. Only two, relatively low doses were assessed: 100 and 300 mg/kg/d. Dams were dosed from gestation day 2 (GD2) through lactation day 20 (LD20). Steady state plasma concentrations measured in dams on LD21 were roughly 10-fold lower than Cmax concentrations via oral gavage at the same doses. There were minimal findings. The NOAEL for F1 neonatal/early postnatal toxicity/developmental toxicity was 100 mg/kg/d and the NOAEL for toxicity for F1 post-weaning/reproductive toxicity and F2 neonatal/early postnatal toxicity was 300 mg/kg/d. Because AUC data were not generated, calculation of the safety margins could not be made.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>Elagolix has been thoroughly evaluated in a full set of nonclinical toxicity studies. Based on in vitro and in vivo animal data, the safety profile of elagolix does not raise concerns for administration to women at the proposed doses and durations. Appropriate labeling to inform pregnancy risk will be included in labeling. From a PharmTox perspective, elagolix is approvable.</p></div>

Specific and sensitive bioanalytical assays have been developed and validated for the quantitative determination of elagolix, NBI-61962 (O-desmethyl metabolite M3) and NBI-54048 (N-dealkyl metabolite M6x) in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, and monkey plasma. Elagolix, NBI-61962 and NBI-54048 were stable for at least 6 months in rabbit, dog and monkey plasma, and for at least 341 days in mouse plasma when stored at -70°C or below. Stability of elagolix, NBI-61962 and NBI-54048 was demonstrated for at least 355 days in rat plasma when stored at -70°C.</p><p>Across all species, the method for quantitation of elagolix in plasma was generally validated over the 5-2000 ng/mL concentration range, with a 5 ng/mL (8 nM) limit of quantitation. The methods for the quantitation of NBI-61962 were generally validated over a 2-800 ng/mL concentration range, with a 2 ng/mL limit of quantitation. The methods for quantitation of NBI-54048 were generally validated over a 1-250 ng/mL concentration range, with a 1 ng/mL limit of quantitation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Group mean body weights (g) Male Female</head><p>Mean body weight was decreased throughout the dosing period for both males (19.4%) and females (18.7%) in the high dose group. Decreased mean body weight for the high dose males and females reached toxicological significance (i.e., more than 10% less than controls) by Day 8 and remained decreased throughout the remainder of the dosing phase (ending at day 274). No other toxicologically meaningful differences in mean body weight were noted in the remaining dose groups. Body weight gains rebounded in the recovery animals.</p><p>Feed Consumption Statistically significant decreases in mean food consumption (21.4% -68.0%) were noted for Weeks 1-4 and Week 10 for high dose males and (26.7% -30.7%) for Weeks 1 and 2 for the females administered 150 mg/kg/day. No other significant test article-related differences in mean food consumption were noted during the dosing or recovery periods. fold. However, the sponsor carried out a calculation that showed that, when adjusted for the difference in affinity of elagolix for the rat and human GnRH receptor, this exposure multiple is reduced to 0.007-fold.</p><p>The sponsor has correctly concluded that, because the elagolix binds so poorly to the rat GnRH receptor, this study cannot effectively assess the effect of elagolix on fertility. That is, even though rats were exposed at a reasonable multiple of the human MRHD based on AUC, the lack of pharmacodynamic effect renders the study not applicable to human risk assessment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Observations and Results</head><p>Assessment of maternal and embryo/fetal toxicity and teratogenic potential was based on mortality, body weights, food consumption, clinical observations, Caesarean section data, and fetal external, visceral, and skeletal examinations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key Study Findings</head><p>There were 6 unscheduled deaths: 2 at the mid-dose (1 of these was a gavage error) and 4 at the high dose. Other than a gavage error in one animal at the mid-dose, cause of death was not established. Of the 4 deaths at the high dose, 3 were euthanizations following abortion.</p><p>The pregnancy rate was unaffected by treatment. Fetal growth was retarded in the high dose group as reflected by decreased gravid uterine weight gain. This was attributed to maternal toxicity in the form of reduced feed consumption and reduced body weight gain.</p><p>One mid-dose and one high dose dam had litters with no viable fetuses, which resulted in an increase in postimplantation loss and a decrease in number of live fetuses in these groups.</p><p>There was no treatment related teratogenicity.</p><p>The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 150 mg/kg/day based on reduced maternal weight gain and decreased feed consumption.</p><p>The sponsor's NOEL for embryo/fetal toxicity was 150 mg/kg/day based on significantly decreased fetal weights at 200 mg/kg/day. However, the reviewer disagrees, based on the finding of increased postimplantation loss at both the mid and high doses. Postimplantation loss was a factor in setting the NOEL in the rat EFD study, but for some reason was discounted by the sponsor in this rabbit study. Reviewer's NOEL for embryofetal toxicity is thus set at 100 mg/kg/d.</p><p>The NOEL for teratogenicity was 200 mg/kg/day, the highest dose used in this study.</p><p>At 100 mg/kg/day on GD20: Cmax = 3.5 ug/mL and AUC = 9.3 ug.hr/mL.

At the high dose, two dams had total litter loss, and one failed to deliver. There were no effects on the mean number of F1 pups born, live litter size, percentage of males at birth, or pup necropsy findings at any exposure level.</p><p>Due to lower F1 postnatal survival and lower F1 birth weights and pre-weaning body weights and body weight gains at 300 mg/kg/day, the NOAEL for F1 neonatal/early postnatal toxicity was 100 mg/kg/day.</p><p>Lower mean maximum startle response (MAX) and average response (AVE) values were noted on PND 20 for F1 males and females in the high dose group. These effects were considered to be in part secondary to the effects on F1 body weights noted during the pre-and post-weaning periods and were attributable to F0 maternal test article exposure. Therefore, the NOAEL for F1 developmental toxicity, including neurobehavioral development was 100 mg/kg/day.</p><p>No toxicity was observed in the F0 maternal animals, in F1 animals during the post-weaning period, or in the F2 pups.

There were no effects on postnatal survival at 100 mg/kg/day. There were lower mean birth weights and lower mean body weight gains for F1 males and females at the high dose, resulting in mean body weights that were generally lower than the control group throughout the pre-weaning period. Furthermore, a higher incidence of small stature (which is defined as small body size in relation to littermates) was noted for the F1 pups in the high dose group (4 pups from 4 litters affected compared to 1 pup from 1 litter in the control group), which corresponded to the lower pup weights in this group. Mean pup body weights and body weight gains for the low dose group were similar to the control group during the postnatal period.</p><p>Developmental landmarks (balanopreputial separation and vaginal patency) in the F1 offspring were unaffected by F0 maternal test article exposure at all exposure levels. In addition, there were no test article-related effects on behavior, including startle response on PND 20 and 60, locomotor activity on PND 21 and 61, and learning and memory assessments on PND 22 and 62. Lower mean overall maximum startle response (MAX) and average response (AVE) values were noted on PND 20 for F1 males and females in the 300 mg/kg/day group.

Furthermore, there were no effects on the F1 gestation lengths or parturition. There were no macroscopic findings in the F1 males and females in any group or effects on the mean numbers of implantation sites, unaccounted-for sites, and corpora lutea at any exposure level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F2 observations:</head><p>There were no effects of F0 maternal exposure on the mean number of F2 pups born, viability on PND 0, postnatal survival, physical condition, mean body weights, body weight gains, or necropsy findings of F2 pups that were found dead or euthanized due to the death of the dam.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NDA #210450 INDs 64802,</head><p>Drug Name: Elagolix, NBI56418, A-1278823.5 Sponsor: Abbvie, Inc.</p><p>Background: Elagolix is a GnRH antagonist being developed for treatment of endometriosis and uterine fibroids. GnRH antagonists cause a suppression of LH and FSH secretion from the pituitary, and a subsequent reduction in levels of sex steroids. In the rat, binding of elagolix to the GnRH receptor (Ki = 1-4 uM) is several orders of magnitude weaker than in human. Receptor binding was not measured in the mouse. Exposure was adequate in both species. Elagolix was found not genotoxic by the standard genetox battery.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mouse Carcinogenicity Study</head><p>CD1 mice (60/sex/dose) were orally administered elagolix in the diet at 0 (vehicle ), 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg/day. The study was conducted in accordance with the dose levels recommended by the Executive CAC. Survival was unaffected in all dosed groups. All male and female groups were terminated in Week 104. There were no drug-related neoplasms in the mouse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rat Carcinogenicity Study</head><p>SD rats (60/sex/dose) were orally administered elagolix in the diet at 0 (vehicle , 150, 300, and 800 mg/kg/day. The study was conducted in accordance with the dose levels recommended by the Executive CAC. There was reduced survival in males at the mid and high dose (33.3 and 31.7%, respectively) when compared to the control group. Survival was unaffected in females. An adequate number of animals survived in all dose groups to provide a valid study. All male groups were terminated at 105 weeks and female groups were terminated at Week 102.</p><p>The high dose of 800 mg/kg/day was associated with significantly increased incidences of hepatic (males) and thyroid adenomas/carcinomas (males and females) by both trend and pairwise analysis. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Clinical Trial Population</head><p>The Applicant conducted two phase 3 pivotal clinical trials in adult premenopausal women 18 to 49 years of age with moderate to severe endometriosis-associated pain. Patients were required to have presence of endometriosis associated pain at baseline. Refer to the Clinical review and relevant clinical study protocols for specific inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Clinical Trial Design</head><p>The Applicant completed two 6-month, phase 3, pivotal, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, multi-center, clinical trials to assess safety and efficacy of elagolix (Studies M12665 and M12671). Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo, elagolix 150mg once daily, or elagolix 200mg twice daily in a 3:2:2 ratio. Refer to the Clinical and Statistical reviews for further discussion on clinical trial design. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> below shows study schematic for both trials.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study M12665: Select Efficacy Endpoints</head><p>(1) Primary Endpoint o Proportion of responders at Month 3 based upon the mutually exclusive scales for daily assessments of dysmenorrhea (DYS) and non-menstrual pelvic pain (NMPP) measured by the Daily Assessment of Endometriosis Pain; use of analgesic medication for endometriosis-associated pain was included in the responder definition).  severe pain causing greater difficulty doing routine things. Response of None, Mild, Moderate, and Severe were assigned a score of 0, 1, 2, 3, respectively. (2) NMSS: This is a single item question with four categorical severity response options (none, mild, moderate and severe). "None" response corresponds to no discomfort while "Severe" to severe pain causing greater difficulty doing routine things. Response of None, Mild, Moderate, and Severe were assigned a score of 0, 1, 2, 3, respectively. (3) DYSP: This is a single item question with five categorical severity responses (not applicable, none, mild, moderate, and severe). A not applicable response corresponds to responder not being sexually active for reasons other than endometriosis. "None" response corresponds to no discomfort with sexual intercourse while a "Severe" response option represented avoiding sexual intercourse because of pain. Response of None, Mild, Moderate, and Severe were assigned a score of 0, 1, 2, 3, respectively. Not Applicable responses were excluded from analysis. (4) Uterine Bleeding: This is a single item question with four response categories (spotting, light, medium, and heavy). A "Spotting" response corresponds to a light amount of bleeding while a "Heavy" response represents &gt;4 tampons or pads required in 24 hours. (5) Overall endometriosis-associated NRS: This is a single item NRS asking patients to rate their overall endometriosis pain over the last 24 hours at its worst. A score 0 represents no pain while a score of 10 represents worst pain ever. (6) Analgesic use: The eDiary allowed patients to enter daily analgesic use (opioid and nonopioid) throughout the clinical trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONTENT VALIDITY</head><p>The Applicant did not provide relevant information in the NDA submission to facilitate the review of content validity of the eDiary. However, the review division agreed to assessing endometriosis associated pain (dysmenorrhea, non-menstrual pelvic pain, and dyspareunia) and uterine bleeding using the eDiary prior to initiation of phase 3 clinical trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments:</head><p>• Dysmenorrhea, non-menstrual pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and uterine bleeding are considered clinically relevant and meaningful signs and symptoms associated with endometriosis in the target patient population. Assessment of these signs and symptoms using the eDiary were agreed upon by the review division prior to initiation of the phase 3 clinical trials. The Applicant did not provide relevant information for review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">INTERPRETATION OF SCORES</head><p>The threshold for reduction in pain was determined based on a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis using the PGIC at Month 3 as an anchor. The response of "much improved" and "very much improved" on the PGIC were used to define responders, and the threshold for response was chosen to balance sensitivity and specificity. That is, it was the value that corresponds to the point on the ROC curve that is closest to the upper left corner, i.e., closest to 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The ROC analyses for DYS and NMPP were conducted separately. The optimal threshold obtained from the ROC analysis using PGIC at Month 3 and change from baseline to Month 3 in DYS was fixed and used for all responder analyses involving change from baseline in DYS (including responder analyses) taking into consideration of both pain reduction and analgesic use and responder analyses solely based on pain reduction at all time points such as Months 1-6 and final visit. Same applies to NMPP and dyspareunia.</p><p>The ROC analyses using percent change from baseline in pain scores were conducted separately from using change from baseline for both DYS and NMPP. The optimal threshold obtained from the ROC analysis using PGIC at Month 3 and percent change from baseline to Month 6 in DYS was fixed and used for all responder analyses involving percent change from baseline in DYS (including responder analyses) taking into consideration of both percent pain reduction and analgesic use and responder analyses solely based on percent pain reduction at all tie points such as Months 1-6 and final visit. Same applies to NMPP and dyspareunia.</p><p>Reviewer Comments: ROC methods used by the Applicant to derive meaningful change threshold is generally considered supportive. Instead, FDA recommends using anchor-based methods as the primary approach supplemented with cumulative distribution function (CDF) to derive specific threshold(s) to interpret PRO data. Refer to reviewer comments in Section C3 for comments related to selection/development of anchor measures.</p><p>The biostatistical reviewer conducted anchor-based analysis using the PGIC to facilitate interpretation of PRO results related to DYS and NMPP scales in both clinical trials. These internal analyses appeared to provide consistent evidence of improvement in pain severity associated with endometriosis in the treatment vs. placebo arms across both phase 3 clinical trials. Refer to the Statistical and Clinical review for additional relevant discussion and analysis.</p></div>
