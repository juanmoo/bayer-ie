<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Recommendation on Regulatory Action</head><p>The reviewers recommend approval of cabozantinib for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy at a dose of 60 mg orally daily.</p><p>The reviewers do not recommend any clinical postmarketing commitments (PMC) or postmarketing requirements (PMR).</p><p>The clinical data reviewed in support of this NDA are from a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial (XL184-308) in patients with advanced renal carcinoma who have had at least one prior VEGF therapy and demonstrate a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit in progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to everolimus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Risk Benefit Assessment</head><p>Renal cell carcinoma is a serious and life-threatening condition. In 2015, it is estimated that there will be 61,560 new cases and 14,080 deaths from RCC in the U.S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">1</ref> The current standard of care for advanced RCC patients whose disease has progressed on or who are resistant to VEGFR-TKI therapy is treatment with everolimus or axitinib. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">3</ref> Sorafenib is also recommended in this setting based on a study in patients who had progressed on a prior systemic (mainly cytokine-based) therapy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">4</ref> Everolimus is the most frequently used second-line therapy following a VEGFR-TKI in patients with RCC. However, these approved second-line options for patients (everolimus and axitinib) are limited by modest PFS benefit and a lack of improvement in OS. In November 2015, nivolumab was approved based on improved OS but no PFS benefit as a second-line treatment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">5</ref> Cabozantinib is an orally bioavailable multi-targeted kinase inhibitor with activity against MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor protein) and VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor), as well as other receptors that have been implicated in tumor pathobiology, including RET (glial cell derived neurotropic factor rearranged during transfection), KIT (stem cell factor receptor), AXL (GAS6 receptor), and FLT (Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3). Cabozantinib suppresses MET and VEGFR2 signaling, inducing apoptosis of endothelial and tumor cells. The recommendation for approval of cabozantinib is based on the results of Trial XL-184308, a multicenter, open-label, international, randomized (1:1) trial of cabozantinib versus everolimus in adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who have had one prior VEGF therapy. Patients were stratified by the number of prior of VEGFRtargeting therapies and number of risk factors per Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center prognostic criteria for previously treated patients with RCC.</p><p>Patients (n=658) were randomized and treated with either cabozantinib 60 mg orally daily (n=330) or everolimus 10 mg orally daily (n=328) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients on both arms who had disease progression could continue treatment at the discretion of the investigator. The primary endpoint was PFS among the first 375 randomized patients (PITT population), by IRC-determined RECIST criteria. There was a statistically significant improvement in PFS for patients in the cabozantinib arm compared with the everolimus arm, with a 3.6 month difference in median PFS (7.4 vs. 3.8 months). The hazard ratio adjusted for stratification factors was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.76; stratified log-rank p-value &lt; 0.0001) per eCRF and 0.58 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.74; stratified log-rank p-value &lt; 0.0001) per IVRS. Key secondary endpoints were OS and objective response rate (ORR) in the Intent-to-Treat population (ITT). Median OS in the ITT population was 21.4 and 16.5 months in the cabozantinib and everolimus arms, respectively [HR 0.66 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.83); p=0.0003]. Confirmed ORR was 17% (95% CI: 13, 22) in the cabozantinib arm and 3% (95% CI: 2, 6) in the everolimus arm.</p><p>Safety was evaluated in 331 patients treated with cabozantinib. The most common (greater than or equal to 20%) adverse reactions included diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, hypertension, rash, palmarplantar erythrodysesthesia, weight decreased, and dygeusia. Serious adverse events were reported in 40% of patients. The most common serious adverse events (greater than or equal to 2%) were abdominal pain, pleural effusion, diarrhea, nausea, and anemia. Fifteen deaths were reported within 30 days of the last cabozantinib dose. Eight of the deaths were attributed to progressive disease, five deaths were due to cognitive deterioration, pneumonia, hemorrhage, cardiac failure, and urosepsis respectively, and two deaths were due to sudden cardiac death. Sixty percent of patients treated with cabozantinib had at least one dose reduction while on study. Ten percent of patients in the cabozantinib group required treatment discontinuation and seventy percent required dose modification, including dose interruption or dose reduction. The most frequent AEs leading to dose reduction of cabozantinib were diarrhea (16%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (11%), fatigue (10%), and hypertension (7.6%).</p><p>Given the rate of dose reductions and modifications in Trial XL184-308, the requirement of a dose finding study was considered by the review team. However, modeling and simulations indicated that lower starting doses such as 40 mg or 20 mg daily could possibly compromise efficacy though incidences of dose reductions may be lower than Clinical Review Michael Brave, Harpreet Singh NDA 208692 Cabometyx (cabozantinib) 12 at the 60 mg dose. In addition, despite the rate of dose reductions in the cabozantinib group, the rate of treatment discontinuations due to adverse events was only 10%, suggesting that most AE's were appropriately managed with dose interruptions and supportive measures. The dose selection of 60 mg daily is adequate based on exposure-response analyses, and a safety profile which is acceptable for the patient population.</p><p>With the recent approval of nivolumab, patients with previously treated metastatic RCC in the US may no longer receive everolimus as second-line therapy. However, there is no comparative efficacy requirement to support regular approval, and everolimus is an approved and active comparator.</p><p>Cabozantinib demonstrated superiority to everolimus with a statistically significant improvement in PFS, OS and ORR. The improvement in median PFS and OS is considered clinically meaningful. Cabozantinib has a favorable benefit-risk profile for treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Product Information</head><p>Cabozantinib is an orally bioavailable multi-targeted kinase inhibitor with activity against MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor protein) and VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor), as well as other receptors that have been implicated in tumor pathobiology, including RET (glial cell derived neurotropic factor rearranged during transfection), KIT (stem cell factor receptor), AXL (GAS6 receptor), and FLT (Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3). Cabozantinib suppresses MET and VEGFR2 signaling, inducing apoptosis of endothelial and tumor cells.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Tables of Currently Available Treatments for Proposed Indications</head><p>Anti-angiogenic therapy has been shown to have clinical benefit in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). During the past decade, the FDA has granted regular approval to seven targeted drugs for patients with RCC. Six of these drugs were approved based on improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), whereas temsirolimus was approved in poor-prognosis patients based on improved OS. In December 2015, nivolumab, an immunotherapeutic agent that blocks the T-cell checkpoint programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) was granted regular approval for the treatment of advanced RCC patients who have received prior antiangiogenic therapy based on an improved OS. Nivolumab is currently approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma. 3. The landscape of metastatic RCC is evolving with recent approvals, and it is unclear how this will impact the therapeutic sequence. Given the overall survival advantage demonstrated by nivolumab, it will be interesting to observe how providers select the optimal second line therapy for metastatic RCC.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Important Safety Issues with Consideration to Related Drugs</head><p>Several multi-targeted kinase inhibitors have been approved in the US for the treatment of hematologic and oncologic malignancies. While the targets and relative levels of target inhibition for these compounds vary, many toxicities of these multi-targeted TKIs are overlapping. However each compound does retain a distinctive toxicity profile. In addition to other TKIs, the safety experience with selective monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab, which targets VEGFR, is also relevant.</p><p>Toxicities reported with agents used in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma in the Warnings and Precautions or Adverse Reactions: Postmarketing Experience sections of the current or proposed US Package Insert (USPI) are listed below in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 2</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Submission Quality and Integrity</head><p>The submission contains all required components of the eCTD. The overall quality and integrity of the application appear acceptable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Compliance with Good Clinical Practices</head><p>The Applicant states that the trial was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as defined by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and in accordance with the ethical principles underlying European Union Directive 2001/20/EC and the United States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 50 (21CFR50). The laws and regulatory requirements of all countries that had sites participating in this trial were adhered to. The trial was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol, amendments, and patient informed consent received appropriate approval by the IRB/IEC prior to initiation of trial at the site. No breaches of the conditions and principles of GCP in connection with the trial or protocol were reported.</p><p>Protocol deviations were identified by the applicant via on-site monitoring and programmed checks based on data collected in the case report form (CRF) as well as review of data listings.</p><p>The Applicant defined the following protocol deviations as "important": Any eligibility violation that, in the judgment of the medical monitor, could put an individual subject's safety at risk or result in enrollment of a subject who is not within the intended study population. Any other deviation that, in the judgment of the medical monitor, could put an individual subject's safety at risk or meaningfully impact the interpretation and/or validity of study results.</p><p>The number of subject eligibility violations was similar between arms (11% in both arms). The most common inclusion criteria deviations were not meeting required screening laboratory values within the required time periods, and receipt of the last dose of the most recently received VEGFR-TKI more than 6 months before the date of randomization. The most common exclusion criteria deviations were not meeting the required criteria for QTcF and receipt of any type of small molecule kinase inhibitor within two weeks before randomization.</p><p>Important protocol deviations that did not involve eligibility criteria were also well balanced between treated arms and are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 3</ref>. The most frequently observed category was randomization irregularities that potentially impacted efficacy. Deviations observed in this category included stratification errors by incorrect determination of the MSKCC risk group or the number of prior VEGFR-TKIs. The primary PFS analysis by the Applicant was stratified by data collected on the eCRFs. A concordance analysis of eCRF-and IVRS-based stratification values revealed some discrepancies, more so for the MSKCC risk factors than the prior VEGFR-TKIs (See <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 4</ref>). Discrepancies were consistent between the ITT and PITT populations.  Reviewer comments: 1. The nature and distribution of the eligibility or important protocol violations are unlikely to have substantially affected the efficacy outcomes. Although some patients were stratified incorrectly, we performed sensitivity analyses of PFS using IVRS data and the PFS analysis remained in favor of the cabozantinib arm.</p><p>To follow the intent-to-treat principle, IVRS data was used in the stratified analysis as well as in the product label (See Section 6.1.4 and 6.1.5) 2. Protocol violations were balanced evenly between treatment arms. 3. While there are a substantial number of protocol deviations categorized as 'other,' it is unlikely that they had a substantial impact on the safety or efficacy of the study. As the primary endpoint was PFS, it is unlikely that these protocol deviations could have impacted the assessment of progression. For safety, missing data such as ECG and vital signs were unlikely to impact the overall assessment. Many of these assessments were captured throughout the study and did not reveal any new safety signals. Long term stability data including up to 36 months at 25 °C/60%RH for the drug product batches manufactured with a process representative of the proposed commercial manufacturing process and at the intended commercial site (Patheon, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) were submitted. Based on stability results from these batches, an expiry of 36 months was granted for the drug product stored in the proposed commercial packaging system at 25 °C/60% RH. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis Populations</head><p>Reference ID: 3917720 The ITT population contained 658 patients: 330 randomized to cabozantinib and 328 randomized to everolimus. The PITT population (the first 375 patients randomized) included 187 patients in the cabozantinib arm and 188 patients in the everolimus arm. The safety population consisted of all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study treatment (n = 653): 331 in the cabozantinib arm and 322 subjects in the everolimus arm. Five patients randomized to receive everolimus did not receive study treatment, and one patient (Patient 1417-3624) was randomized to the everolimus arm but received cabozantinib as study treatment and therefore was evaluated in the cabozantinib arm for the Safety population <ref type="table" target="#tab_25">(Table 8</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Considerations</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy</head><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was PFS, using RECIST 1.1 criteria, as determined by an independent radiology committee (IRC). Secondary efficacy endpoints were OS and objective response rate (ORR).</p><p>It was estimated that 375 patients were sufficient to assess the primary PFS endpoint. However, 650 patients were needed to provide sufficient power to evaluate OS. Therefore, to allow longer PFS follow-up for fewer patients and to avoid overrepresenting patients with early progression, the primary analysis was to be conducted after 259 PFS events had been observed among the first 375 randomized patients. Thus, only the first 375 patients randomized were included in the primary endpoint intent to treat population ("PITT population"), whereas all 650 randomized patients were included in analyses of OS (ITT population).</p><p>For the primary endpoint, it was estimated that 259 PFS events in the first 375 randomized patients would provide 90% power to detect a HR of 0.667, using the logrank test and a 2-sided significance level of 5%. This corresponds to a 33.3% reduction in the risk of progression or death, or a 50% improvement in median PFS from 5 months to 7.5 months. Under this design, the minimum observed effect that would result in Clinical Review Michael Brave, Harpreet Singh NDA 208692 Cabometyx (cabozantinib) 38 statistical significance is a 27.8% improvement (HR = 0.783) in PFS from 5 to 6.39 months.</p><p>When the required number of events was reached for analysis of the primary endpoint, PFS was to be tested at a 2-sided 0.05 significance level. If the null hypothesis was rejected, two secondary endpoints were then to be tested in parallel: ORR was to be tested at a 2-sided 0.01 significance level, and an interim analysis of OS at a 2-sided 0.0001 level, per a Lan-DeMets O'Brien-Fleming alpha spending function. The PFS analysis could not be performed until all 650 patients in the ITT population were enrolled.</p><p>For the secondary efficacy endpoint of OS, assuming a single interim analysis at the 33% information fraction (at the time of the primary analysis of PFS) and a subsequent primary analysis, 408 deaths among 650 patients were estimated to provide 80% power to detect a HR of 0.75, using the log-rank test and a 2-sided significance level of 4%. This corresponds to a 25% reduction in the risk of death, or a 33% improvement in median OS from 15 to 20 months. Under this design, the minimum observed effect that would result in statistical significance is a 22.5% improvement (HR=0.816) in OS from 15 to 18.38 months.</p><p>The ORR was defined as the proportion of patients whose best response was complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as assessed by the IRC per RECIST 1.1, performed at the time of the primary PFS analysis, using a chi-squared test at a 2-sided significance level of 1%, based on the ITT population available at that time. Patients with no post-baseline tumor assessments were to be considered nonresponders.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety</head><p>The safety profile was to be measured by incidences of treatment emergent-adverse events (TEAEs), changes in laboratory parameters and vital signs from baseline, and ECOG PS. Adverse event assessments and laboratory tests were assessed at baseline and continuously throughout the trial at the beginning of each subsequent cycle. The Applicant also submitted narrative summaries of deaths, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, overall AEs, select AEs, and laboratory abnormalities.

Key changes are summarized here:</p><p>A Maintenance Phase was added to the Treatment Period to be implemented when sufficient data had been collected to adequately evaluate all study endpoints. This is further described above.</p><p>The study population was limited to including approximately 10% of subjects (maximum of approximately 65 subjects) who had been previously treated with antibodies targeting the programmed cell death immune receptor, PD-1, or its ligands, PD-L1/L2. Two exploratory study endpoints were added: changes in bone scans and changes in serum calcium from baseline. Clarifications on imaging including time points of assessments were added. Within the summary of the schedule of bone scan assessments, the required interval for patients who had received 12 months of study treatment was expanded from 16 weeks to 24 weeks. There were no changes regarding the method of evaluation, imaging guidelines, or instructions for investigator assessments.</p><p>Reviewer comments:</p><p>1. None of the changes introduced by Amendment 1.0 significantly altered the patient population, primary efficacy analysis, or management of toxicity. The primary objective of Study XL184-307 was to evaluate the effect of cabozantinib compared to prednisone on OS.

Based on the available data, the study did not meet its primary endpoint of the proportion of patients with a pain response at Week 6 confirmed at Week 12. The intent to treat (ITT) population contained 658 patients randomized to receive cabozantinib (n=330) or everolimus (n=328). Demographics and baseline disease characteristics appeared generally well-balanced between treatment arms. The majority of patients were male (75%) with a median age of 62 years. Seventy-one percent (71%) received only one prior VEGFR-directed therapy, 69% received only one prior antiangiogenic therapy, and 41% received sunitinib as their only prior therapy. Forty-six percent of patients were in the MSKCC favorable risk category, 42% were in the intermediate risk category, and 13% were in the poor risk category.</p><p>The results of XL184-308 demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS, as determined by the IRC, in the first 375 patients randomized (PITT population) to cabozantinib compared to those treated with everolimus with a 3.6 month improvement in median PFS with stratification data from the IVRS at the time of randomization (HR=0.58 [95% CI: 0.45, 0.74]; stratified log rank p-value &lt;0.0001). The ORR (as determined by the IRC) was 17% (95% CI: 13, 22) versus 3% (95% CI: 2, 6) in the cabozantinib and everolimus arms, respectively (unstratified p-value &lt;0.0001). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median duration of response (DOR) had not been reached (95% CI: 7.2, NE) in the cabozantinib arm and was 7.4 months (95% CI: 1.9, NE) in the everolimus arm. The treatment effect of cabozantinib appeared consistent across all patient subgroups analyzed. With the recent approval of nivolumab, patients with previously treated metastatic RCC in the US may no longer receive everolimus as second-line therapy. However, there is no comparative efficacy requirement to support regular approval, everolimus is an approved and active comparator, and the results of XL184-308 show statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in PFS and OS compared to everolimus.</p></div>

This difference was not statistically significant, as the p-0.0019 required to achieve statistical significance at the time of the first interim analysis was not reached.</p><p>Reviewer comment: The OS data was not mature at the time of the primary analysis, as only 202 (49%) of the 408 required for the prespecified primary analysis of OS had been observed.</p><p>On 11 February 2016, The Applicant submitted a Clinical Study Report Addendum containing results of a second interim OS analysis in the ITT population, with a cutoff date of 31 December 2015. This analysis included 320 total deaths, representing 78% of the total 408 deaths required for the planned final OS analysis. The minimum time of follow-up from randomization of the 658 th patient through 31 December 2015 was 13 months. Survival status as of 31 December 2015 was determined for 642 (98%) of the 658 randomized patients. For the 16 patients for which it could not be established (6 in the cabozantinib arm and 10 in the everolimus arm), 13 withdrew consent and 3 were lost to follow-up. These patients were censored at the date of most recent contact prior to the data cutoff.</p><p>The analysis demonstrated a statistically significant difference in duration of OS for subjects in the cabozantinib arm compared with the everolimus arm: There was a 4.9 month improvement in median OS (21.4 vs. 16.5 months) for subjects in the cabozantinib arm compared with the everolimus arm. The hazard ratio adjusted for stratification factors was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.83; stratified log-rank p-value = 0.0003) per eCRF and 0.66 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.83; stratified log-rank p-value = 0.0003) per IVRS <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 19</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>).

Only patients with confirmed CR or PR were included in this analysis. The censoring rules used for the primary PFS analysis were applied. At the time of the analysis, the median duration of response had not been reached for the cabozantinib arm and was 7.4 months for the everolimus arm.  Reviewer Comment: The data regarding DOR remain immature at the time of this review. However, these preliminary findings are consistent with the other efficacy measures reported and support the overall conclusion that cabozantinib has activity in this clinical setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time to Response</head><p>The median time to objective response was 1.91 months (range 1.6, 11.0) in the cabozantinib arm and 2.14 months (range 1.9, 9.2 months) in the everolimus arm. The bone scan response (BSR) rate was defined as the proportion of patients in the ITT population who had bone lesions on bone scan at baseline and for whom the best bone scan response at the time of data cutoff was a response, responder (R) as assessed per CAD by the IRC. The bone scan response rate was 18% (95% CI: 11, 27) in the cabozantinib arm and 10% (95% CI: 4, 19) in the everolimus arm. The protocol defined pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, external radiation therapy to bone, and surgery to bone as SREs. A total of 12% of patients in the cabozantinib arm and 14% in the everolimus arm had an SRE post-randomization. Reviewer Comment: Rates of post-randomization SREs appeared similar between treatment arms, although the trial was not powered to detect differences with respect to SREs.</p></div>

The approved dosing regimen for Cometriq was 140 mg (capsules) by mouth once daily, taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. A post-marketing requirement was to evaluate a lower dose</p><p>In the current submission, the Applicant seeks the approval of a tablet formulation of cabozantinib (Cabometyx TM ) for the treatment of advanced RCC in patients who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy. The proposed dosing regimen for Cabometyx tablets is 60 mg by mouth once daily, taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.</p><p>In Trial XL184-308, Cabometyx (60 mg tablet QD) improved median PFS and OS; however, the dose was reduced in 60% of patients, with 20% receiving 20 mg as their lowest dose. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose reduction were diarrhea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, fatigue, and hypertension.</p><p>The Clinical Pharmacology review team considers the Cabometyx dose of 60 mg QD to be acceptable for the RCC indication and the clinical review team agrees. A higher dose is not considered appropriate, given dose reductions occurred in 60% patients at 60 mg QD. Modeling and simulations indicated that lower starting doses such as 40 mg or 20 mg QD likely compromises efficacy though the incidences of dose reductions may be lower than 60 mg QD dose. Taking the cabozantinib concentration of 1125 ng/mL (median concentration at 60 mg QD dose) as the reference, the hazard ratio would be 1.1 and 1.39 if the exposure was reduced to 67% and 33% of the reference concentration, respectively. Reduction in tumor size in the 20 mg QD (median percent change from baseline = -4.45%) and 40 mg QD (-9.1%) starting dose groups were predicted to be smaller than that in the 60 mg QD dose group (-11.9%). Objective response rates at 40 mg QD (15.6%) and 20 mg QD (8.70%) were predicted lower than that in the 60 mg QD (19.1%) dose groups.</p><p>Cross-study PK analysis indicated similar steady-state exposures at different doses across patient populations of medullary thyroid cancer (140 mg capsules), advanced RCC (60 mg tablet), and castration-resistant prostate cancer (60 mg tablet).</p><p>Reference ID: 3917720 Exploratory analyses of treatment beyond progression in XL184-308 were repeated for patients with Investigator-determined rPD.  Reviewer's Comment: Similar proportions of patients were treated beyond rPD, whether determined by the IRC or investigators, in both arms. Substantial fractions of patients in both arms experienced continued tumor control (post-PD SOD &lt; baseline SOD) after the first date of progression. The labeling will state that the protocol allowed for patients to receive treatment until disease progression or experiencing unacceptable toxicity and that patients on both arms who had disease progression could continue treatment at the discretion of the investigator.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">(b) (4) (b) (4)</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Summary</head><p>The safety of cabozantinib for this supplement was evaluated in Trial XL184-308, a randomized, open-label, international trial in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma that has progressed after prior anti-angiogenic kinase inhibitor therapy. The clinical review of safety focused on the 653 treated patients, 331 in the cabozantinib group and 322 patients in the everolimus group. The safety review also analyzed data from three other trials; two metastatic prostate cancer (Trial XL184-307 and Trial XL184-306) and medullary thyroid cancer (Trial XL184-301) resulting in a total safety database of 1286 cabozantinib treated patients. The overall safety profile of cabozantinib in Trial XL184-308 was similar to that of the described safety of cabozantinib in the label for the indication of medullary thyroid cancer. Cabozantinib exposure was adequate to assess safety with a median duration of 32 weeks in the cabozantinib group and 19 weeks in the everolimus group. However, the median relative dose intensity was 76% in the cabozantinib group compared to 92% in the everolimus group.</p><p>Overall, 40% of patients in the cabozantinib group and 43% of patients in the everolimus group experienced serious adverse events (SAEs).

Patients in Study XL184-306 were further required to be experiencing pain at baseline despite optimization and of narcotic use. Bone metastases are the primary source of morbidity and major contributor to mortality for this population. In both Phase 3 CRPC studies, cabozantinib treated patients received the same dose and formulation as in the XL184-308 RCC study (ie, starting doses of 60 mg tablet qd).</p></div>

A review of medically important cabozantinib-related adverse events across tumor types suggested that some differences in rates of AEs may be due to tumor type. For example, the higher rate of GI perforations and fistulas in the MTC population when compared to the CRPC and RCC populations. MTC patients are more vulnerable to upper airway and GI tract complications due to the location of tumor burden in the chest/neck regions and applied local therapies, such as surgery and radiation.</p></div>

The common high level terms in the cabozantinib group were diarrhea (74%), asthenic conditions (71%), nausea and vomiting symptoms (56.5%), appetite disorders (45.9%), and skin and subcutaneous conditions (42%).   Abnormalities in hematology tests were primary Grade 1 to 2 in severity in the cabozantinib group. Decreased white blood cells and decreased absolute neutrophil count occurred more frequently in the cabozantinib group compared with the everolimus group. However decreases in hemoglobin, lymphocytes, and platelets were more frequent in the everolimus treated group. Abnormalities in liver function tests were also primarily Grade 1 to 2 severity. Grade 3-4 increases in liver function tests (AST, ALT, and ALP) occurred more frequently in the cabozantinib group compared to the The potential for cabozantinib to induce liver injury was assessed by the incidence of potential Hy's Law cases, and by the incidence of AEs related to hepatotoxicity.</p><p>A summary of patients who met laboratory screening for potential drug-induced liver injury (DILI; concurrent ALT or AST &gt; 3x the ULN, total bilirubin &gt; 2 x ULN, and ALP &lt; 2  There were no cases that met the screening criteria for Hy's Law in either treatment arm. There were two patients in the cabozantinib group who had ALT or AST &gt; 3 x ULN, total bilirubin &gt; 2 x ULN, factors:</p><p>Patient 3910-3100 experienced an elevation of transaminases 30 days after initiation of treatment with cabozantinib. On Study Day 32, treatment with cabozantinib was interrupted due to fever, asthenia, PPES, and mucositis. On Study Day 36, after taking ciprofloxacin for 3 days and acetaminophen for 2 days, the patient met the screening ULN). The clinical characteristics of the abnormalities were consistent with cholestatic hepatitis which was confirmed by histology from a liver biopsy. Following discontinuation of cabozantinib, ciprofloxacin, and acetaminophen and initiation of immunosuppressive treatment with methylprednisone, the subject's ALT, AST, and bilirubin laboratory values decreased to near normal levels. The case was confounded by the use of concomitant medications of ciprofloxacin and acetaminophen immediately after the initial elevation of liver enzymes which may have contributed to the cholestatic hepatitis event. An additional potential cause could have been delayed autoimmune-mediated hepatitis associated with prior nivolumab treatment; the patient discontinued nivolumab 2 to 3 months prior to enrolling in the current study.</p><p>Patient 1361-3312 had laboratory assessments that met the screening criteria of ALT Day 351. The patient had tumor metastases in the pancreas at baseline and elevated amylase and lipase levels. Treatment with cabozantinib had been interrupted on Study Day 338 due to recurrent and worsening of ALT and AST levels without an increase in bilirubin or significant changes in ALP. On Study Day 358, the patient was hospitalized for uncontrolled abdominal pain. An abdominal CT scan showed bile duct obstruction by pancreatic head mass. The patient underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with biliary stent placement. Following this procedure, ALT, AST, bilirubin, ALP, serum amylase and lipase levels were resolving, and treatment with cabozantinib was discontinued due to PD. A temporal relationship exists between the initial elevations of ALT and AST and cabozantinib treatment; however the malignant bile duct obstruction due to disease progression further increased transaminase levels and resulted in elevated cholestatic markers (ALP and bilirubin).</p><p>Reviewer comment:</p><p>1. There were no Hy's Law cases identified. The incidence of screening events for potential cases which met Hy's Law criteria was comparable on both study arms suggesting no marked increase in the risk of hepatotoxicity associated with the use of cabozantinib.</p></div>

On September 13, 2013, the Applicant discussed with FDA their plans for a tablet formulation of cabozantinib. On April 8, 2015, the Applicant was granted Fast Track Designation for treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who have received one prior therapy. On July 27, 2015, the Applicant submitted a request for Breakthrough Therapy Designation which was granted on August 21, 2015 based on preliminary evidence from Trial XL184-308 which indicated that the treatment effect of cabozantinib may represent a substantial improvement over existing therapies for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma after prior VEGFR-TKI therapy. On September 2, 2015, FDA addressed the general submission plan for the NDA. FDA stated that the Applicant should focus on the pivotal Phase 3 study in in their filing. FDA also stated that a review of additional OS analysis would occur during the NDA review. The Applicant states that additional PK reports would be submitted after the initial filing. FDA also stated that a 120-Day Safety update was not required, and recommended a rolling NDA submission.</note></figure>

Randomization was stratified by number of prior VEGFR-targeting TKI therapies (1 vs. 2 or more) and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MKSCC) prognostic score for previously treated patients with RCC (0 vs. 1 vs. 2 or 3 risk factors).

There were 29 venous and mixed/unspecified events. The applicant was queried for baseline platelet count, and platelet count at time of thrombotic event. The applicant provided information for the 24 patients for which these events arose. Screening platelet values were available for all patients. Platelet values within 7 days of start date of the event was available for 21 patients. 6%) were reported by the applicant to have ONJ in the cabozantinib group; one patient experienced a Grade 3 SAE and other experienced a nonserious Grade 2 AE. The patient who experienced a Grade 3 SAE of ONJ has an ongoing AE of Grade 2 ONJ which was assessed as related to prior therapy. This patient who experienced the Grade 2 AE also had a history of ONJ prior to randomization.ONJ was reported for two patients in the everolimus group. Both of these patients experienced Grade 3 SAEs. No AEs of ONJ were reported as Grade 2 or higher in either treatment arm.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The incidence of events of QTc prolongation was low for both treatment groups (one patient each).</p><p>Patient 4929-3536 in the cabozantinib group had a Grade 2 nonserious AE of ECG QT prolonged on Study Day 59. The patient was receiving cabozantinib at a dose of 60 mg daily at the time of onset of the AE, and no modifications in study treatment were implemented as a result of the event. No QTC correction by the Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt; 500 ms was reported for this patient, and the absolute increase in QTcF from baseline for this patient was unknown.</p></div>
