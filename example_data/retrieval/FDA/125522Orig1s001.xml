<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Primary Hyperlipidemia</head><p>REPATHA ® is indicated as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), who require additional lowering of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia</head><p>REPATHA is indicated as an adjunct to diet and other LDL-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, ezetimibe, LDL apheresis) for the treatment of patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) who require additional lowering of LDL-C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Limitations of Use</head><p>The effect of REPATHA on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Recommended Dosage</head><p>The recommended subcutaneous dosage of REPATHA in patients with HeFH or patients with primary hyperlipidemia with established clinical atherosclerotic CVD is either 140 mg every 2 weeks OR 420 mg once monthly. When switching dosage regimens, administer the first dose of the new regimen on the next scheduled date of the prior regimen.</p><p>The recommended subcutaneous dosage of REPATHA in patients with HoFH is 420 mg once monthly. In patients with HoFH, measure LDL-C levels 4 to 8 weeks after starting REPATHA, since response to therapy will depend on the degree of LDL-receptor function.</p><p>If an every 2 week or once monthly dose is missed, instruct the patient to:</p><p>• Administer REPATHA as soon as possible if there are more than 7 days until the next scheduled dose, or, • Omit the missed dose and administer the next dose according to the original schedule.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Important Administration Instructions</head><p>• The 420 mg dose of REPATHA can be administered: o over 9 minutes by using the single-use on-body infusor with prefilled cartridge, or o by giving 3 injections consecutively within 30 minutes using the single-use prefilled autoinjector or single-use prefilled syringe.</p><p>• Provide proper training to patients and/or caregivers on how to prepare and administer REPATHA prior to use, according to the Instructions for Use, including aseptic technique. Instruct patients and/or caregivers to read and follow the Instructions for Use each time they use REPATHA.</p><p>• Keep REPATHA in the refrigerator. Prior to use, allow REPATHA to warm to room temperature for at least 30 minutes for the single-use prefilled autoinjector or single-use prefilled syringe and for at least 45 minutes for the single-use on-body infusor with prefilled cartridge. Do not warm in any other way. Alternatively, for patients and caregivers, REPATHA can be kept at room temperature at 68° F to 77°F (20°C to 25°C) in the original carton. However, under these conditions, REPATHA must be used within 30 days [see How <ref type="bibr">Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)</ref>].</p><p>• Visually inspect REPATHA for particles and discoloration prior to administration. REPATHA is a clear to opalescent, colorless to pale yellow solution. Do not use if the solution is cloudy or discolored or contains particles.</p><p>• Administer REPATHA subcutaneously into areas of the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm that are not tender, bruised, red, or indurated using a single-use prefilled syringe, single-use prefilled autoinjector, or single-use on-body infusor with prefilled cartridge.</p><p>• Do not co-administer REPATHA with other injectable drugs at the same administration site.</p><p>• Rotate the site of each subcutaneous administration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS</head><p>REPATHA is a sterile, clear to opalescent, colorless to pale yellow solution available as follows:</p><p>• Injection: 140 mg/mL solution in a single-use prefilled syringe • Injection: 140 mg/mL solution in a single-use prefilled SureClick ® autoinjector • Injection: 420 mg/3.5 mL solution in a single-use Pushtronex TM system (on-body infusor with prefilled cartridge)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Allergic Reactions</head><p>Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., rash, urticaria) have been reported in patients treated with REPATHA, including some that led to discontinuation of therapy. If signs or symptoms of serious allergic reactions occur, discontinue treatment with REPATHA, treat according to the standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">ADVERSE REACTIONS</head><p>The following adverse reactions are also discussed in other sections of the label:</p><p>• Allergic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Clinical Trials Experience</head><p>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse Reactions in Patients with Primary Hyperlipidemia and in Patients with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia</head><p>REPATHA is not indicated for use in patients without familial hypercholesterolemia or atherosclerotic CVD [see Indications and Usage (1.1)].</p><p>The data described below reflect exposure to REPATHA in 8 placebo-controlled trials that included 2651 patients treated with REPATHA, including 557 exposed for 6 months and 515 exposed for 1 year (median treatment duration of 12 weeks). The mean age of the population was 57 years, 49% of the population were women, 85% White, 6% Black, 8% Asians, and 2% other races.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse Reactions in a 52-Week Controlled Trial</head><p>In a 52-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (Study 2), 599 patients received 420 mg of REPATHA subcutaneously once monthly [see Clinical <ref type="bibr">Studies (14.1)</ref>]. The mean age was 56 years (range: 22 to 75 years), 23% were older than 65 years, 52% women, 80% White, 8% Black, 6% Asian, and 6% Hispanic. Adverse reactions reported in at least 3% of REPATHA-treated patients, and more frequently than in placebo-treated patients in Study 2, are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>. Adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 2.2% of REPATHA-treated patients and 1% of placebo-treated patients.</p><p>The most common adverse reaction that led to REPATHA treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo was myalgia (0.3% versus 0% for REPATHA and placebo, respectively). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse Reactions in Seven Pooled 12-Week Controlled Trials</head><p>In seven pooled 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials, 993 patients received 140 mg of REPATHA subcutaneously every 2 weeks and 1059 patients received 420 mg of REPATHA subcutaneously monthly. The mean age was 57 years (range: 18 to 80 years), 29% were older than 65 years, 49% women, 85% White, 5% Black, 9% Asian, and 5% Hispanic. Adverse reactions reported in at least 1% of REPATHA-treated patients, and more frequently than in placebo-treated patients, are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse Reactions in Eight Pooled Controlled Trials (Seven 12-Week Trials and One 52-Week Trial)</head><p>The adverse reactions described below are from a pool of the 52-week trial (Study 2) and seven 12-week trials. The mean and median exposure durations of REPATHA in this pool of eight trials were 20 weeks and 12 weeks, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Local Injection Site Reactions</head><p>Injection site reactions occurred in 3.2% and 3.0% of REPATHA-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common injection site reactions were erythema, pain, and bruising. The proportions of patients who discontinued treatment due to local injection site reactions in REPATHAtreated patients and placebo-treated patients were 0.1% and 0%, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Allergic Reactions</head><p>Allergic reactions occurred in 5.1% and 4.7% of REPATHA-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common allergic reactions were rash (1.0% versus 0.5% for REPATHA and placebo, respectively), eczema (0.4% versus 0.2%), erythema (0.4% versus 0.2%), and urticaria (0.4% versus 0.1%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neurocognitive Events</head><p>In placebo-controlled trials, neurocognitive events were reported in less than or equal to 0.2% in REPATHA-treated and placebo-treated patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Low LDL-C Levels</head><p>In a pool of placebo-and active-controlled trials, as well as open-label extension studies that followed them, a total of 1988 patients treated with REPATHA had at least one LDL-C value &lt; 25 mg/dL. Changes to background lipid-altering therapy were not made in response to low LDL-C values, and REPATHA dosing was not modified or interrupted on this basis. Although adverse consequences of very low LDL-C monkeys were subcutaneously administered evolocumab from organogenesis through parturition at dose exposures up to 12 times the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 420 mg every month. In a similar study with another drug in the PCSK9 inhibitor antibody class, humoral immune suppression was observed in infant monkeys exposed to that drug in utero at all doses. The exposures where immune suppression occurred in infant monkeys were greater than those expected clinically. No assessment for immune suppression was conducted with evolocumab in infant monkeys. Measurable evolocumab serum concentrations were observed in the infant monkeys at birth at comparable levels to maternal serum, indicating that evolocumab, like other IgG antibodies, crosses the placental barrier. FDA's experience with monoclonal antibodies in humans indicates that they are unlikely to cross the placenta in the first trimester; however, they are likely to cross the placenta in increasing amounts in the second and third trimester. Consider the benefits and risks of REPATHA and possible risks to the fetus before prescribing REPATHA to pregnant women.</p><p>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Animal Data</head><p>In cynomolgus monkeys, no effects on embryo-fetal or postnatal development (up to 6 months of age) were observed when evolocumab was dosed during organogenesis to parturition at 50 mg/kg once every 2 weeks by the subcutaneous route at exposures 30-and 12-fold the recommended human doses of 140 mg every 2 weeks and 420 mg once monthly, respectively, based on plasma AUC. No test of humoral immunity in infant monkeys was conducted with evolocumab.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2">Lactation</head><p>Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of evolocumab in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for REPATHA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from REPATHA or from the underlying maternal condition. Human IgG is present in human milk, but published data suggest that breast milk antibodies do not enter the neonatal and infant circulation in substantial amounts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.4">Pediatric Use</head><p>The safety and effectiveness of REPATHA in combination with diet and other LDL-C-lowering therapies in adolescents with HoFH who require additional lowering of LDL-C were established based on data from a 12-week, placebo-controlled trial that included 10 adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years old) with HoFH [see Clinical <ref type="bibr">Studies (14.3)</ref>]. In this trial, 7 adolescents received REPATHA 420 mg subcutaneously once monthly and 3 adolescents received placebo. The effect of REPATHA on LDL-C was generally similar to that observed among adult patients with HoFH. Including experience from openlabel, uncontrolled studies, a total of 14 adolescents with HoFH have been treated with REPATHA, with a median exposure duration of 9 months. The safety profile of REPATHA in these adolescents was similar to that described for adult patients with HoFH.</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of REPATHA have not been established in pediatric patients with HoFH who are younger than 13 years old.</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of REPATHA have not been established in pediatric patients with primary hyperlipidemia or HeFH.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.5">Geriatric Use</head><p>In controlled studies, 1420 patients treated with REPATHA were ≥ 65 years old and 171 were ≥ 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11">DESCRIPTION</head><p>Evolocumab is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) directed against human proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9). Evolocumab has an approximate molecular weight (MW) of 144 kDa and is produced in genetically engineered mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells.</p><p>REPATHA is a sterile, preservative-free, clear to opalescent, colorless to pale yellow solution for subcutaneous administration. Each 1 mL single-use prefilled syringe and single-use prefilled SureClick ® autoinjector contains 140 mg evolocumab, acetate (1.2 mg), polysorbate 80 (0.1 mg), proline (25 mg) in Water for Injection, USP. Sodium hydroxide may be used to adjust to a pH of 5.0. Each single-use Pushtronex TM system (on-body infusor with prefilled cartridge) delivers a 3.5 mL solution containing 420 mg evolocumab, acetate (4.2 mg), polysorbate 80 (0.35 mg), proline (89 mg) in Water for Injection, USP. Sodium hydroxide may be used to adjust to a pH of 5.0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12.1">Mechanism of Action</head><p>Evolocumab is a human monoclonal IgG2 directed against human proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9). Evolocumab binds to PCSK9 and inhibits circulating PCSK9 from binding to the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR), preventing PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation and permitting LDLR to recycle back to the liver cell surface. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, evolocumab increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL from the blood, thereby lowering LDL-C levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12.2">Pharmacodynamics</head><p>Following single subcutaneous administration of 140 mg or 420 mg of evolocumab, maximum suppression of circulating unbound PCSK9 occurred by 4 hours. Unbound PCSK9 concentrations returned toward baseline when evolocumab concentrations decreased below the limit of quantitation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12.3">Pharmacokinetics</head><p>Evolocumab exhibits non-linear kinetics as a result of binding to PCSK9. Administration of the 140 mg dose in healthy volunteers resulted in a C max mean (standard deviation [SD]) of 18.6 (7.3) μg/mL and AUC last mean (SD) of 188 (98.6) day•μg/mL. Administration of the 420 mg dose in healthy volunteers resulted in a C max mean (SD) of 59.0 <ref type="bibr">(17.</ref>2) μg/mL and AUC last mean (SD) of 924 (346) day•μg/mL. Following a single 420 mg intravenous dose, the mean (SD) systemic clearance was estimated to be 12 (2) mL/hr. An approximate 2-to 3-fold accumulation was observed in trough serum concentrations (C min [SD] 7.21 <ref type="bibr">[6.6]</ref>) following 140 mg doses administered subcutaneously every 2 weeks or following 420 mg doses administered subcutaneously monthly (C min [SD] 11.2 [10.8]), and serum trough concentrations approached steady state by 12 weeks of dosing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Absorption</head><p>Following a single subcutaneous dose of 140 mg or 420 mg evolocumab administered to healthy adults, median peak serum concentrations were attained in 3 to 4 days, and estimated absolute bioavailability was 72%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distribution</head><p>Following a single 420 mg intravenous dose, the mean (SD) steady-state volume of distribution was estimated to be 3.3 (0.5) L.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metabolism and Elimination</head><p>Two elimination phases were observed for REPATHA. At low concentrations, the elimination is predominately through saturable binding to target (PCSK9), while at higher concentrations the elimination of REPATHA is largely through a non-saturable proteolytic pathway. REPATHA was estimated to have an effective half-life of 11 to 17 days.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specific Populations</head><p>The pharmacokinetics of evolocumab were not affected by age, gender, race, or creatinine clearance, across all approved populations [see Use in Specific Populations <ref type="bibr">(8.5)</ref>].</p><p>The exposure of evolocumab decreased with increasing body weight. These differences are not clinically meaningful.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Renal Impairment</head><p>Since monoclonal antibodies are not known to be eliminated via renal pathways, renal function is not expected to impact the pharmacokinetics of evolocumab. Patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) have not been studied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hepatic Impairment</head><p>Following a single 140 mg subcutaneous dose of evolocumab in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, a 20-30% lower mean C max and 40-50% lower mean AUC were observed as compared to healthy patients; however, no dose adjustment is necessary in these patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pregnancy</head><p>The effect of pregnancy on evolocumab pharmacokinetics has not been studied [see Use in Specific Populations <ref type="bibr">(8.1)</ref>].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Drug Interaction Studies</head><p>An approximately 20% decrease in the C max and AUC of evolocumab was observed in patients coadministered with a high-intensity statin regimen. This difference is not clinically meaningful and does not impact dosing recommendations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.1">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</head><p>The carcinogenic potential of evolocumab was evaluated in a lifetime study conducted in the hamster at dose levels of 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg administered every 2 weeks. There were no evolocumab-related tumors at the highest dose at systemic exposures up to 38-and 15-fold the recommended human doses of 140 mg every 2 weeks and 420 mg once monthly, respectively, based on plasma AUC. The mutagenic potential of evolocumab has not been evaluated; however, monoclonal antibodies are not expected to alter DNA or chromosomes.</p><p>There were no adverse effects on fertility (including estrous cycling, sperm analysis, mating performance, and embryonic development) at the highest dose in a fertility and early embryonic developmental toxicology study in hamsters when evolocumab was subcutaneously administered at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg every 2 weeks. The highest dose tested corresponds to systemic exposures up to 30-and 12fold the recommended human doses of 140 mg every 2 weeks and 420 mg once monthly, respectively, based on plasma AUC. In addition, there were no adverse evolocumab-related effects on surrogate markers of fertility (reproductive organ histopathology, menstrual cycling, or sperm parameters) in a 6-month chronic toxicology study in sexually mature monkeys subcutaneously administered evolocumab at 3, 30, and 300 mg/kg once weekly. The highest dose tested corresponds to 744-and 300-fold the recommended human doses of 140 mg every 2 weeks and 420 mg once monthly, respectively, based on plasma AUC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.2">Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</head><p>During a 3-month toxicology study of 10 and 100 mg/kg once every 2 weeks evolocumab in combination with 5 mg/kg once daily rosuvastatin in adult monkeys, there were no effects of evolocumab on the humoral immune response to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) after 1 to 2 months exposure. The highest dose tested corresponds to exposures 54-and 21-fold higher than the recommended human doses of 140 mg every 2 weeks and 420 mg once monthly, respectively, based on plasma AUC. Similarly, there were no effects of evolocumab on the humoral immune response to KLH (after 3 to 4 months exposure) in a 6-month study in cynomolgus monkeys at dose levels up to 300 mg/kg once weekly evolocumab corresponding to exposures 744-and 300-fold greater than the recommended human doses of 140 mg every 2 weeks and 420 mg once monthly, respectively, based on plasma AUC.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What is REPATHA?</head><p>REPATHA is an injectable prescription medicine called a PCSK9 inhibitor. REPATHA is used:</p><p>• along with diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy in adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition that causes high levels of LDL) or atherosclerotic heart or blood vessel problems, who need additional lowering of LDL cholesterol.</p><p>• along with diet and other LDL lowering therapies in people with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition that causes high levels of LDL), who need additional lowering of LDL cholesterol. The effect of REPATHA on heart problems such as heart attacks, stroke, or death is not known. It is not known if REPATHA is safe and effective in children with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) who are younger than 13 years of age or in children who do not have HoFH.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Who should not use REPATHA?</head><p>Do not use REPATHA if you are allergic to evolocumab or to any of the ingredients in REPATHA. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in REPATHA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What should I tell my healthcare provider before using REPATHA?</head><p>Before you start using REPATHA, tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions, including allergies, and if you:</p><p>• are allergic to rubber or latex. The needle covers on the single-use prefilled syringes and within the needle caps on the single-use prefilled SureClick  autoinjectors contain dry natural rubber. The single-use Pushtronex TM system (on-body infusor with prefilled cartridge) is not made with natural rubber latex.</p><p>• are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if REPATHA will harm your unborn baby. Tell your healthcare provider if you become pregnant while taking REPATHA.</p><p>• are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. You and your healthcare provider should decide if you will take REPATHA or breastfeed. You should not do both without talking to your healthcare provider first. Tell your healthcare provider or pharmacist about any prescription and over-the-counter medicines you are taking or plan to take, including natural or herbal remedies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How should I use REPATHA?</head><p>• See the detailed "Instructions for Use" that comes with this patient information about the right way to prepare and administer REPATHA.</p><p>• Use REPATHA exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to use it.</p><p>• REPATHA is administered under the skin (subcutaneously), every 2 weeks or 1 time each month.</p><p>• REPATHA comes as a single-use (1 time) prefilled autoinjector (SureClick ® autoinjector), as a single-use prefilled syringe or as a single-use Pushtronex TM system (on-body infusor with prefilled cartridge). Your healthcare provider will prescribe the type and dose that is best for you.</p><p>• If your healthcare provider prescribes you the monthly dose, you may use: o a single-use on-body infusor with prefilled cartridge over 9 minutes, or o 3 separate injections in a row, using a different single-use prefilled syringe or single-use prefilled autoinjector for each injection. Give all of these injections within 30 minutes.</p><p>• If your healthcare provider decides that you or a caregiver can administer REPATHA, you or your caregiver should receive training on the right way to prepare and administer REPATHA. Do not try to administer REPATHA until you have been shown the right way by your healthcare provider or nurse.</p><p>• Do not administer REPATHA together with other injectable medicines at the same injection site.</p><p>• Always check the label of your single-use prefilled autoinjector, single-use prefilled syringe, or single-use on-body infusor with prefilled cartridge to make sure you have the correct medicine and the correct dose of REPATHA before each administration.</p><p>• If you forget to use REPATHA or are not able to take the dose at the regular time, administer your missed dose as soon as you remember, as long as there are more than 7 days until the next scheduled dose. If there are 7 days or less until your next scheduled dose, administer the next dose according to the original schedule. This will put you back on your original schedule. If you are not sure when to take REPATHA after a missed dose, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist.</p><p>• If you use more REPATHA than you should, talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist.</p><p>• Do not stop using REPATHA without talking with your healthcare provider.

The results from the clinical trials can be used as part of a formative study to improve the product design and the instructions for use (IFU). You should also collect subjective data during the clinical trials which may inform how to improve your product design and IFU.</p><p>• You stated in your End of Phase 2 Meeting Request that you will conduct design verification and validation Human Factor Engineering (HFE) study that includes simulated use studies. We require you to conduct validation Human Factors usability study for the autoinjector (AI) and large volume injector (LVI). You may also consider conducting validation Human Factors usability study for the prefilled syringe, since this is a new user population.</p><p>• Consider the following for your user groups and study methodology:  If your device requires special training prior to the use of the devices, then your study should include at least a total of 90 participants equally divided between trained and untrained arms as follows: o 30 representative patients with injection experience (i.e.,15 participants trained and 15 participants untrained). o 30 representative patients without injection experience (i.e.,15 participants trained and 15 participants untrained).</p><p>Since representative patients may have concomitant health conditions (e.g., diabetes), ensure you include participants with vision and dexterity issues. o 30 health care practitioners that will be using the device: nurses and physicians (i.e. 15 participants trained and 15 participants untrained).  If training will not be required as part of the labeling, then study should only have the untrained arm as described above.</p><p>•In your Human Factors study, we recommend including a task to simulate complete device failure.</p><p>•The feedback mechanism regarding dose delivery may also be insufficient. Consider color-blind patients who may not be able to distinguish between the blue, green, and red lights. The beeps may not be helpful if the patient is distracted or loses track of the count or has trouble hearing. You may want to consider simplifying this aspect of your device.</p><p>•Any data collected and analyzed in a validation study should be described in terms of how it supports the safety case claim that your device can be used safely and effectively by the indicated users. We expect you to collect both empirical and qualitative data in a design validation study.</p><p>•Performance Data -Your test participants should be given an opportunity to use the device independently and in as realistic a manner as possible, without guidance, coaching, praise or critique from the test The AMD utilizes an electromechanical system to inject the drug product. When the user presses the activation button, the needle inserts and the motor is activated, which injects the drug product into the patient's tissue over the course of approximately 9 minutes.</p><p>According to the applicant, following removal of the AMD from the packaging, the user opens the door of the AMD, inserts the prefilled cartridge assembly, and closes the door. The AMD has an adhesive which attaches the device to the skin for dose administration. After removing the adhesive liner and adhering to the body, the injection is initiated by the user upon depressing the activation button, Once the user presses the button, the needle is inserted into subcutaneous tissue, and the loaded AMD subsequently initiates drug administration. The drug is automatically injected . The loaded AMD provides visual and auditory notifications to the user to signal the completion of injection.

CDRH performed a review of the device constituent of the combination product for BLA 125522/S001 for Amgen's Automated Mini-Doser for on-body subcutaneous infusion of Repatha. The focus of the CDRH review was on the risk assessment and performance testing of the device risk including design verification, design validation, biocompatibility testing and software validation. The device underwent extensive testing to verify the device against specifications. The commercial iteration of the device passed all testing requirements, biocompatibility tests, and software validation. The risk assessment identified the critical aspects of the device and linked to test reports used to reduce the residual risk to an acceptable level.</p><p>The CDRH reviewer states that while significant changes were made between device iterations (refer to <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 14</ref> for additional information), the Sponsor has provided adequate evidence that these changes will not impact the effectiveness of the device. Additionally, this testing provides evidence that the differences between pump iterations Two hundred and ninety-two subjects were enrolled at 4 study centers in the United States and were randomized equally into 1 of 2 parallel treatments, where treatment group A received a 420 mg total dose of evolocumab via 3 prefilled AI/pens, and treatment group B received a 420 mg dose of evolocumab using a single AMD. Subjects were given a single administration of evolocumab by the clinic staff on Day 1. Subjects were followed through study day 85 for safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic assessments. Two hundred and eighty-nine (99.0%) subjects received IP and 267 (91.4%) completed the study (ie, EOS procedures were performed).</p></div>

All subjects were ≤ 55 years of age. The majority of subjects were white (69.9%), followed by black (22.1%) and Asian (6.6%). The baseline demographics were reasonably balanced between the AMD and AI/pen device groups. Mean (SD) LDL-C concentrations at baseline prior to each dose were similar: 112.2 (28.4) mg/dL and 119.0 (32.0) mg/dL in the AI/pen and AMD groups, respectively.</p><p>Pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic results are presented in Section 4.4.3</p><p>Pharmacokinetics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Device Delivery Assessment</head><p>Of the 289 subjects in the safety analysis set, 14 (4 [2.8%] in AI/pen and 10 [6.9%] in All adverse events related to erythema, injection site erythema, implant site (refers to AMD device placement site) erythema, induration and implant site (AMD device placement site) induration were reported as mild (CTCAE grade 1) in severity. The duration of these adverse events in the AI/pen group ranged from 1 to 5 days with the majority of subjects (25/34; 73.5%) experiencing an event of 1 day duration. The duration of these adverse events in the AMD group ranged from 1 to 3 days with the majority of subjects (58/76; 76.3%) experiencing an event of 1 day duration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Laboratory Evaluations</head><p> No subject had ALT values &gt; 3 x ULN or total bilirubin &gt; 2 x ULN.  One subject had an AST elevation &gt; 3 x ULN.  Nine subjects had postbaseline CK values &gt; 5 x ULN. CK concentrations returned to &lt; 5x ULN in 5 subjects and there were no follow up visits for the other 4 subjects. None of these subjects had muscle related adverse events reported.  A total of 289 subjects in this study were tested for the presence of anti evolocumab antibodies (288 subjects had pre-dose results and 282 had postbaseline results). One subject tested positive for pre-existing antievolocumab binding antibodies: Subject 16866008109 (AI/pen group) tested positive for anti-evolocumab binding antibodies (negative for neutralizing antibodies) at day 1 (prior to receiving evolocumab), at day 29, and at day 85. The subject experienced 3 grade 1 adverse events (muscle pain and 2 incidents of headache) during the study. The C max and AUC last values for this subject after each treatment were within the range of values observed for other subjects in this study. The presence of anti-evolocumab binding antibodies did not appear to impact evolocumab pharmacokinetics for this subject.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p>The study demonstrated that the AMD and AI/pen devices were pharmacokinetically equivalent based on the pre-defined 90% CI for the ratio (AMD to AI/pen) for both AUC last and C max . Changes in LDL-C and PCSK9 also showed a similar pharmacodynamic response for each device.</p><p>In this study, which involved only one administration of evolocumab given by the study site staff, more subjects received incomplete or partial doses due to device failures in the AMD group (6.9%) as compared to the AI/pen group (2.8%); more subjects reported adverse events in the AMD group (70.8%) as compared to the AI/pen group (45.5%); and more subjects reported device-related adverse events in the AMD group (48.6%) as compared to the AI/pen group (26.9%).Treatment emergent adverse events were mainly related to injection site reactions (erythema and induration events) and the majority were transient (1 to 5 days duration) and mild in severity.</p></div>

The primary objective was to assess the subcutaneous (SC) delivery performance of the AMD. The secondary objective was to assess safety and tolerability when using the AMD. Eligible subjects were healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 55 years. The investigational product was the AMD with 3.5 mL placebo buffer containing 0.7% sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). The placebo buffer had comparable viscosity to the evolocumab 120 mg/mL formulation. Using the umbilicus as a center point, each subject's abdomen was divided into 4 quadrants. The first device application and placebo delivery was performed on the left upper quadrant, the second on the right upper quadrant, and the third on the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Each administration delivered 3.5 mL of placebo buffer over approximately 9 minutes and each administration was separated by at least 15 minutes. Complete SC delivery of 3.5 mL of placebo buffer was defined by the device light-emitting diode turning solid green, no observed fluid leakage during delivery, and the window on the device showing complete delivery.</p></div>

At baseline, mean (SD) age was 34.6 (11.0) years.</p><p>Efficacy: Complete SC delivery of 3.5 mL placebo buffer was achieved in 94.7% (284 of 300) of AMD applications (95% CI: 91.5%, 96.7%). The percentage of AMD applications that resulted in complete delivery of placebo buffer increased from 86.0% (95% CI: 77.9%, 91.5%) in period 1, when the first of 3 AMDs was applied to each subject, to 99.0% (95% CI: 94.6%, 99.8%) in periods 2 and 3.</p><p>Safety: Treatment emergent adverse events were reported in 72 (72.0%) subjects. No serious adverse events, fatal adverse events, or adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported. No trends in vital signs or other observations related to safety were noted.</p><p>Treatment emergent adverse events reported in ≥ 5% of subjects were erythema (56.0%), skin induration (43.0%), induration (23.0%), pruritus (20.0%), abdominal distension (17.0%), abdominal pain upper (16.0%), abdominal pain lower (7.0%), and localized edema (5.0%).</p></div>

At each visit (i.e., in the clinic on day 1 and by telephone at weeks 4 and 8), site staff documented on the administration electronic case report form (eCRF) whether the subject was able to successfully administer a full dose of evolocumab, that is, the entire set of three 1.0 mL injections (AI/pen) or the entire 3.5 mL injection (AMD). If the subject was not able to successfully administer a full dose of evolocumab, the site staff documented the reason for a missed or partial injection based on the subject's assessment.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Review</head><p>Eileen Craig, MD BLA 125522 S-001 Repatha (evolocumab) 55 I agree with the applicant that the most likely clinical effect following an instance of the reported failures listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 16</ref> for the AMD device would be under-dosing due to a missed or partial dose of evolocumab. With the AMD device, one missed dose is equivalent to missing one month of lipid lowering therapy. While it is a low likelihood that one missed dose would lead to a significant safety or efficacy risk to the patient, multiple missed or partial doses could be more problematic as the LDL-C level would not be optimally lowered. This situation could potentially be noticed if the health care provider is periodically assessing the LDL-C level but it could lead to reduced effectiveness in LDL-C lowering and, in the worst case scenario, reduced cardiovascular risk reduction.</p><p>Most device-related adverse events were mild in severity and were associated with the injection site. The applicant made design changes to the AMD device as a response to these failures, as summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 14</ref>. Chronological Summary of Device Design Subsystem Changes.</p><p>In Study 20120138, the incidence of device-related events for the AMD was 3.0% in the year 1 SoC-controlled period (evolocumab plus SoC vs SoC alone; SoC alone did not receive injections) and 3.8% for the year 2+ open-label extension. The events were primarily injection site reactions, and all events were nonserious and CTCAE grade 1 and 2 (mild to moderate severity). A direct comparison of incidence rates between the AMD and autoinjector is not possible due to different exposure counts, sample sizes, and dosing schedules. The following two tables provide subject incidence of devicerelated adverse events by preferred term reported during the year 1 SOC-controlled period as well as during the year 2+ OLE. Comments:</p><p>1. DMEPA provides the following comment for consideration by the review Division prior to the approval of this supplement.  Highlights of Prescribing Information, Dosage and Administration i. The ability to administer the 420 mg dose via the automated minidoser needs to be added to the bullet on administering this dose. For example: 1. "To administer the 420 mg dose, give 1 Repatha injection using the automated mini-doser with the pre-filled cartridge. Alternatively give 3 Repatha injections using the autoinjector or pre-filled syringe consecutively within 30 minutes."  Of note, Amgen addressed this concern in their revised label submitted 5/27/2016. 2. OPQ/OBP had several labeling comments which will be conveyed to the applicant.</p></div>

The AMD is a compact, sterile, single-use, disposable, electro-mechanical (battery powered, micro-processor controlled), on-body injection device. The prefilled cartridge assembly is co-packaged with the AMD. The prefilled cartridge assembly is loaded into the AMD immediately prior to use. The 120 mg/mL AMD presentation was developed to reduce the number of injections required for the once monthly dose to a single injection.</p><p>The AMD utilizes an electromechanical system to inject the drug product. When the user presses the activation button, the needle inserts and the motor is activated, which injects the drug product into the patient's tissue over the course of approximately 9 minutes.</p></div>

The dose volume and dose administration duration cannot be changed by the user. Both visual and auditory notifications provide feedback on the progress of drug administration. In the event of a drug delivery error, visual and auditory alarms will notify the user. Additionally, a viewing window that allows the user to see the prefilled cartridge allows inspection to confirm dose completion. Per device design, the needle will not retract from the patient's subcutaneous tissue until physically removed by the patient. The presence of audible and visible notifications for the dose initiation and dose completion, combined with the viewing window are measures to avoid premature removal by the user.</p><p>Reference ID: 3843523</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4)</formula></div>

In addition, there are two AMD Human Factor summative studies that are included in this submission. Both used placebo that mimics the appearance and viscosity of the evolocumab drug product. Both studies were simulated use with injections into skin pads. Changes between the first and second study included To discuss the proposed clinical development program and the device clinical study strategy from pivotal studies to commercial launch for the two indications of (1) hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia and (2) secondary prevention of heart disease.</p><p>Issues related to the AMD device:</p><p>• Although you plan to collect data on the usability of your product presentations during the clinical trial, a well-designed human factors (HF) study is required. The results from the clinical trials can be used as part of a formative study to improve the product design and the instructions for use (IFU). You should also collect subjective data during the clinical trials which may inform how to improve your product design and IFU.</p><p>• You stated in your End of Phase 2 Meeting Request that you will conduct design verification and validation Human Factor Engineering (HFE) study that includes simulated use studies. We require you to conduct validation Human Factors usability study for the autoinjector (AI) and large volume injector (LVI). You may also consider conducting validation Human Factors usability study for the prefilled syringe, since this is a new user population.</p><p>• Consider the following for your user groups and study methodology:  If your device requires special training prior to the use of the devices, then your study should include at least a total of 90 participants equally divided between trained and untrained arms as follows: o 30 representative patients with injection experience (i.e.,15 participants trained and 15 participants untrained). o 30 representative patients without injection experience (i.e.,15 participants trained and 15 participants untrained).</p><p>Since representative patients may have concomitant health conditions (e.g., diabetes), ensure you include participants with vision and dexterity issues. o 30 health care practitioners that will be using the device: nurses and physicians (i.e. 15 participants trained and 15 participants untrained).</p><p> If training will not be required as part of the labeling, then study should only have the untrained arm as described above.</p><p>•In your Human Factors study, we recommend including a task to simulate complete device failure.</p><p>•The feedback mechanism regarding dose delivery may also be insufficient. Consider color-blind patients who may not be able to distinguish between the blue, green, and red lights. The beeps may not be helpful if the patient is distracted or loses track of the count or has trouble hearing. You may want to consider simplifying this aspect of your device.</p><p>•Any data collected and analyzed in a validation study should be described in terms of how it supports the safety case claim that your device can be used safely and effectively by the indicated users. We expect you to collect both empirical and qualitative data in a design validation study.</p><p>•Performance Data -Your test participants should be given an opportunity to use the device independently and in as realistic a manner as possible, without Performance Data -Your test participants should be given an opportunity to use the device independently and in as realistic a manner as possible, without guidance, coaching, praise or critique from the test facilitator/moderator.  The applicant states that design changes were made for the AMD device as a response to these failures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Effect of Failures reported for the AMD Device</head><p>The applicant states, and I agree, that the most likely clinical effect following an instance of the reported failures above for the AMD device would be under-dosing due to a missed or partial dose of evolocumab. A missed dose of evolocumab with each of these devices is described by the applicant with a severity rating of 3 (on scale of 1-9) which is considered a mild severity (one that may result in temporary impairment not necessarily requiring significant professional intervention, inconvenience or temporary discomfort). A missed dose would not constitute an immediate safety or efficacy risk to the patient, provided that this was not a chronic issue.</p><p>As of the data cutoff of 01 July 2014, there were no serious device-related adverse events reported during use of the AMD device in the clinical trials. Nearly all device-related adverse events were mild in severity and were associated with the injection site.</p><p>On initial overview of the NDA/BLA application for filing:</p></div>

The comparability data supporting this new device was previously submitted to the original BLA and cross-referenced within this supplement, and was reviewed in the original BLA (Document ID: 3772601 dated 01 June 2015, in DARRTS).</p><p>Study 20110168 evaluated the comparability of a dose of 420 mg evolocumab delivered either via 3.5 mL AMD or 3 AI/Pens in healthy volunteers.</p><p>For the reference treatment (prefilled AI/pen), evolocumab was presented as a sterile, preservative-free solution in a single use, disposable, handheld mechanical (spring-based) prefilled AI/pen for fixed dose 140 mg SC/injection. The prefilled AI/pen contained a 1.0 mL deliverable volume of 140 mg/mL evolocumab in 220 mM proline, 20 mM acetate, 0.01% (w/v) polysorbate 80, pH 5.0. Subjects in the reference treatment received a total dose of 420 mg evolocumab via 3 prefilled AI/pens. The injections were administered into 3 different quadrants in the subject's anterior abdominal wall. The 3 SC injections were administered in a consecutive fashion with each injection separated by no more than 1 minute from the previous injection.</p><p>For the test treatment, evolocumab was presented as an AMD for fixed-dose 420 mg SC/injection. The AMD contained a 3.5 mL deliverable volume of 120 mg/mL evolocumab in 220 mM proline, 20 mM acetate, and 0.01% (w/v) polysorbate 80, pH 5.0. Subjects in the test treatment received an evolocumab 420 mg dose as a single SC injection in the anterior abdominal wall via the AMD. The complete dose with the AMD was administered over 9 minutes.</p><p>Similar mean unbound evolocumab serum concentration time profiles were observed after a 420 mg SC dose of evolocumab when delivered using the AMD or 3 AI/pens. Median tmax was 4.0 days for both AMD (range = 2.0 to 9.9 days) and 3 AI/pens (range = 1.9 to 10 days). The geometric least square mean ratios (90% CI) of the AMD to 3 AI/pens for Cmax and AUClast were 1.10 (1.03 -1.18) and 1.06 (0.97 -1.14), respectively, indicating comparability between the formulations from the two devices.</p><p>Mean serum evolocumab concentration profiles for the two treatments are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>Mean pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>, and statistical comparison of evolocumab PK parameters is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.6">Analysis of Root Name and the Proposed Modifier Pushtronex</head><p>The root name, 'Repatha' is approved for the product, evolocumab, and has been on the market since August of 2015. As noted in section 2.2.5, we have not received any medication errors related to name confusion. Repatha is currently available as a prefilled syringe and an autoinjector (Repatha SureClick) in 140 mg/mL strength. Currently approved doses are 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg every two or four weeks, depending on the indication. Three injections using the either the prefilled syringe or the autoinjector is currently required to administer the 420 mg dose. Thus the Applicant is seeking for approval of the AMD that can deliver the entire 420 mg as a single injection using the Repatha Pushtronex device. We agree with the use of the same root name "Repatha" for the proposed product.</p><p>The Applicant proposes to use the modifier 'Pushtronex' to differentiate the proposed AMD from the currently marketed prefilled syringe and the autoinjector. It is not uncommon for modifiers to be used to denote a specific formulation or packaging configuration (e.g., Advair Diskus and Advair HFA) as part of a product line extension. The applicant states that the modifier 'Pushtronex' is from the use of the word "Push" refers to the action needed to initiate the injection. "Tronex" is derived from "Electronics," referring to the electronic device." The device is not currently marketed.</p><p>Additionally, the modifier 'Pushtronex' has not been previously marketed and is not available on its own. However, we also note that omission and oversight of a modifier is cited in literature 2 as a common cause of medication error. Postmarketing experience shows that the introduction of product line extensions result in medication errors if the modifier is omitted and the product characteristics are similar or overlap. We note that in this instance there would be no delay in treatment or missed dose since the patient should be able to receive the intended dose (dose will be noted on a prescription) with the available product presentations since the addition of the proposed device is intended to provide an alternate means of administering the 420 mg dose, which is currently approved. <ref type="bibr">May 5, 2016</ref>. At that time we also requested additional information or concerns that could inform our review. Per e-mail correspondence from DMEP on May 17, 2016, they stated no additional concerns with the proposed proprietary name, Repatha Pushtronex.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p>The study met its primary endpoint by demonstrating that the AMD and AI/pen devices were pharmacokinetically equivalent based on the pre-defined 90% CI for the ratio (AMD to AI/pen) for both AUClast and Cmax. In addition, changes in LDL-C and PCSK9 indicated a similar pharmacodynamic response for each device.</p><p>Treatment emergent adverse events were mainly related to injection site reactions (erythema and induration events) and were transient and mild in severity. Safety analyses were consistent with previous studies of evolocumab and did not identify any new risks.</p><p>Device related events for each group were anticipated and consistent with administration differences between the 2 devices (3 separate 1.0 mL injection less than a minute apart for AI/pen vs a single 3.5 mL injection over 9 minutes for AMD). None of these events were serious.</p><p>• device related adverse events in the AI/pen group were similar to those reported in a previous evolocumab studies which utilized the AI/pen device • device related adverse events in the AMD group in this study were similar to those reported in a previous placebo buffer study which utilized the AMD device Complete delivery of evolocumab was achieved for 430/435 (98.9%) of the AI/pens used and for 134/144 (93.1%) of the AMDs used. The primary objective of this study was to characterize the safety and tolerability of long-term administration of evolocumab.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Study Number: 20120356</head><p>The secondary objective was to characterize the efficacy of long-term administration of evolocumab as assessed by lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in subjects with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia.</p><p>The objective of this interim analysis is to summarize the safety and lipid data collected up to a data cutoff date for subjects with at least 12 weeks of potential safety and efficacy follow up in this open-label extension study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Endpoint(s):</head><p>The primary endpoint of this study was the subject incidence of adverse events.</p><p>The secondary endpoints for this interim analysis were:</p><p>• percent change from parent study baseline in LDL-C at each visit with planned lipid measurements • change from parent study baseline in LDL-C at each visit with planned lipid measurements • percent change from parent study end of study in LDL-C at each visit with planned lipid measurements • change from parent study end of study in LDL-C at each visit with planned lipid measurements Exploratory endpoints for this interim analysis included:</p><p>• subject incidence of adjudicated cardiovascular events -death (all cause, cardiovascular) -cardiac ischemic events (myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, coronary revascularization) -hospitalization for heart failure -cerebrovascular events (transient ischemic attack, stroke) • subject incidence of non-coronary revascularization </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p>A total of 3121 subjects from 7 parent studies were included in the interim analysis of this long-term, open-label extension study. Of these, 2928 subjects had at least 12 weeks of potential follow up in this study and were included in the ICOAS evaluated in this report; 1951 subjects were randomized to receive evolocumab plus standard of care (evolocumab group) and 977 were randomized to receive standard of care alone (control group). This interim analysis provides data for 1951 subjects with a total of 1066.5 patient-years of exposure to evolocumab.</p><p>Data from this interim analysis support the following conclusions on long-term treatment with evolocumab:</p><p>• Reductions of ≥ 50% in LDL-C were observed and maintained in subjects receiving chronic administration of evolocumab during this extension study regardless of parent study treatment assignment (ie, evolocumab or control). • Reductions in LDL-C and other lipid parameters at week 12 and week 24 are consistent with those at the end of the parent study for subjects who received evolocumab in the parent study, demonstrating a stable effect of evolocumab on lipid parameters with long-term use. . Thereafter, few subjects switched between dosing regimens. • Long-term treatment with evolocumab is well tolerated. The overall incidence of adverse events, grade 3 to 4 adverse events, and serious adverse events was generally similar between the evolocumab and control groups. The overall safety assessment of evolocumab was not changed after the review of the broad search strategy for events of interest. • No trends indicative of clinically important treatment related laboratory abnormalities were observed. Antievolocumab binding antibody formation was rare; no neutralizing antibodies were detected. • The overall incidences of cardiovascular endpoint events and non-coronary revascularizations were similar between the evolocumab and control groups. • Administration of evolocumab with the AI/pen by self-administration in the home-use setting is safe and effective for its intended use and the conditions of use.</p><p>Based on the interim results of this study, chronic treatment with evolocumab Q2W or QM has a favorable benefit:risk profile and maintains reductions in LDL-C and improvements in other lipid parameters in subjects with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">REGULATORY HISTORY</head><p>BLA 125522 for Repatha (evolocumab) injection pre-filled syringe and Repatha SureClick (evolocumab) injection pre-filled autoinjector was approved on August 27, 2015. Repatha is administered at a dose of 140 mg once every two weeks or 420 mg once a month. The Applicant is proposing a new pre-filled cartridge co-packaged with an automated mini-doser administration device for their product line so the 420 mg dose can be delivered without the need for multiple injections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">MATERIALS REVIEWED</head><p>We considered the materials listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> for this review. The Appendices provide the methods and results for each material reviewed. materials and tested the modified device and instructional materials in the human factors supplemental study to ensure the revisions were effective in addressing use errors observed in the previous study and did not introduce any new errors. The results of both studies are summarized below.</p><p>In the validation and supplemental human factors studies, the Applicant categorized the tasks as follows:  Essential: tasks necessary for the successful use of the device for its intended purpose.</p><p>Our evaluation indicates that failures of these tasks (e.g. insert cartridge into device, closing cartridge door) may result in underdoses and missed doses. Therefore, our review focused only on the errors occurred with these tasks.  Safety critical: tasks associated with potential use errors that could lead to a significantly clinical impact. Our evaluation indicates that failure of these tasks does not necessarily affect safe administration of a dose of Repatha using the automated mini-doser (e.g., washing hands, cleaning injection site with alcohol wipe, inspecting drug appearance, inspecting cartridge for damage, checking expiration date, cleaning cartridge bottom with alcohol wipe, discarding device properly avoiding needle stick). Although we agree with the Applicant that these tasks may be safety-critical, we note that these tasks are not unique for this particular product and apply to other injectable product that are already in the market and require these steps. After considering the interface, including labeled instructions, between the proposed product and similar products and known use errors for these tasks, we determined that the residual risk is acceptable and we do not recommend any further risk mitigation strategies for these steps. Therefore, our review focuses on tasks that are unique to the proposed product.  Non-essential/non-safety critical: tasks that are not crucial for successful use of the device (e.g., wait 45 min to reach room temperature, gather supplies, check the medicine window, check that green light turned off, examine injection site). We agree with the Applicant's definition of these tasks as they are not crucial in terms of being able to administer a correct dose and will not result in significant clinical harm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Human Factors Validation Study</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repatha Automated Mini-Doser (AMD)</head><p>The study was conducted with 93 representative users (31 patients, 31 caregivers, and 31 healthcare providers) with about half trained and half un-trained (please refer to Appendix C for the study details). We noted in the study prior to administering the first testing scenario, the moderator advised the participants on the injection site and a skin pad was secured to the assigned location. In the actual use environment, we expect that this patient population will typically receive training and therefore be advised on the injection site from their health care providers prior to use since there are currently no marketed electro-mechanical on-body injectable therapies for this indication (primary hyperlipidemia, mixed dyslipidemia, homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia). <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> below lists the essential tasks where failures occurred and the number of participants that failed the tasks. A total of 30 use errors were associated with the essential tasks. They are described in additional details below. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Error in opening the cartridge door (3 errors by 2 untrained participants and 2 errors by 2 trained participants)</head><p> The four participants (one participant committed this error twice) inadvertently closed the cartridge door while performing other tasks.</p><p>Reference ID: 3943307</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">(b) (4) 5</formula><p>We note that this task was retested in the supplemental study.</p><p>Failed to Insert cartridge into the device (1 error by 1 untrained participant (same participant that committed two errors in the open cartridge door task) and 2 errors by 2 trained participants)  One untrained caregiver inadvertently closed the door during the process of inserting the cartridge (discussed above).  One trained healthcare professional did not push the cartridge in all the way and forced the door close during two attempts of the first scenario. This was done because the individual did not recall the explanation during the training and did not remember reading about it in the IFU. Without properly inserting the cartridge in device the correctly users would not be able to proceed as the door would not be able to be closed.  One trained healthcare professional removed the cartridge top when inserting the cartridge into the device. The individual did not use the IFU and thought the top was like a cap like those in syringes at work.  Our evaluation of the root cause analysis indicates the errors were not related to the product user interface. If the user fails to insert the cartridge into the device, they cannot proceed with further steps. The user will need to figure out how to properly insert the cartridge by referring to the IFU, this type of error may result in delayed therapy. Our review of the IFU indicates that it should be modified to call out the users' attention to properly perform this task. We recommend that the Applicant move the statement "Do not remove or rotate the cartridge top or bottom" to the first bullet in step 2C of the IFU. Of note, the Applicant changed the IFU by replacing with "press down firmly" in step 2D to mitigate this error. We also recommend We note that this task was retested in the supplemental study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Did not completely close cartridge door (8 errors by 7 participants (1 participant was the same one that made errors in the two tasks listed above) and 5 errors by 5 trained participants)</head><p> In all but one of the instances the participants did not completely close the cartridge door and believed it was closed. In some instances the plunger came down to fill the medicine window and in others it did not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6</head><p> There were three participants (all untrained caregivers) that did not detect the alarm and thought the injection was completed, two of which were . One of these caregivers made this error on two attempts however they did detect the alarm on the second attempt. All of the other participants that made this error did detect the alarm.  One untrained caregiver intentionally closed the door before inserting the cartridge on the second attempt then forced the cartridge door open while the device was already attached to the skin pad and pumping in order to insert the cartridge. This participant committed this error as they were . We noted that in all the cases, failure to close the cartridge door generated the alarm/alert. We note that only one participant referred to the full IFU. Therefore these errors could be attributed to participants only while performing the tasks. Our review also indicates that use performance with the untrained group was worse than the trained group. As a result of these errors, the Applicant changed the IFU to list the closing of the cartridge door as its own step and added "squeeze tight" at the depiction of this step in the IFU. These changes were tested in the supplemental human factor study which is discussed in Section 3.2 below. Our review of the IFU indicates that adding an additional statement such as "Apply enough pressure when closing the door and make sure a snap is heard before proceeding" to step 2E can further clarify this task. We also recommend</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Failure to completely peel off adhesive tab (device activates) (2 errors by 2 untrained participants)</head><p> The patient participant removed the entire adhesive by ripping it off. The participant was not using the IFU during the simulation and assumed this is the way it was supposed to be done.  The healthcare professional participant did not completely peel off the small adhesive tab as the participant encountered resistance and believed something was wrong with the device as a result stated they would not use the device. The participant was using the IFU. We can attribute these errors to pre-existing notions of the participants that when tabs are seen the thought is to pull them off sometimes too abruptly. Our review of the IFU indicates that adding the statement such as "Do not pull the skin adhesive backing off the 7 " as the first bullet in step 3A to increase clarity on how to perform this task.</p><p>Failure to place device onto (valid) injection site in a correct orientation (2 errors by 2 untrained participants, one of which was the same participant that made an error in the peel off adhesive tab task)  The patient participant was orienting the device with the start button pressing against the skin pad and their finger on the needle door during placement. The moderator intervened to avoid a potential needle stick. The participant corrected the orientation .  The healthcare professional participant placed the device on the skin pad with the light facing down and then peeled it off and repositioned it with the light facing up. The participant was confused because they thought was not clear. The root cause analysis indicates that these errors were resulted from the participant's unfamiliarity with the device. We recommend that training should be provided to all users before their first use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Press the start button prior to placing the device on the injection site and prior to inserting the cartridge (3 errors by 3 untrained participants (one of which was the same participant that made errors in close the door, insert cartridge, and open the door tasks) and 1 error by 1 untrained participant which was the same participant that made an error in close the cartridge door task)</head><p> The untrained patient pressed the start button prior to placement of the device on the skin pad after removing the adhesive tabs. The participant was exploring the device as they were reading the IFU and did not realize you can only press the button once.  One untrained participant pressed the start button prior to placement of the device on the skin pad after removing the adhesive tabs. The participant was not using the IFU and believed that is what was supposed to be done to use the device.  One untrained caregiver pressed the start button after placing the device on the skin pad but without inserting the cartridge. This was in the second attempt at the simulated injection scenario. This participant committed this error as they were using  One trained caregiver during session 1 pressed the start button prior to placement on the skin pad due to a cognitive failure. The participant placed the device on the skin pad and was unaware of what caused the error alarm/alert after detecting it. The root cause analysis indicates that these errors were resulted from participant's unfamiliarity with the device, incorrectly using the reference materials, and lack of re-call.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Did not wait until injection has completed (1 error by 1 untrained participant and 2 errors in 2 trained participants)</head><p> One untrained caregiver did not wait for the injection to complete because they did not know it took 9 minutes. The participant removed the device quickly after the injection began because of pre-conceived notion that it was like a traditional shot. The participant also saw the flashing green light so they were thinking it was complete, as they .  One trained healthcare professional did not wait for the injection to complete removing the device 2 minutes into the injection. The participant did not see the plunger advancing in the window and thought the device was malfunctioning. This error occurred during the second session as the participant thought that during the first scenario they saw the plunger after about a minute. The participant also thought there may be a problem because she saw a red light flash during the startup cycle (after tab removal). The error alarm/alert was detected.  One trained healthcare professional did not wait for the injection to complete and removed the device toward the end of the 9 minute injection. The participant thought the medicine window was completely filled by the plunger so the dose was completely delivered. The root cause analysis indicates that the participants misinterpret the device feedback (for example, the flashing green light, the plunger rod advancing in the dose window). Our review of the IFU indicates that it does not sufficiently describe the device feedback that the users should be aware. As a result, we recommend adding "Plunger completely fills medicine window" as a bullet in Step 3E and bolding "solid green" to ensure users do not miss this important information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">SUPPLEMENTAL HUMAN FACTORS STUDY</head><p>Due to the errors that occurred in the validation human factors study, the Applicant made changes to the user interface and IFU . The changes were as follows:</p><p>and modified IFU to address errors that occurred in the summative study. We note that this supplemental study only focused on evaluating those changes initiated by the Applicant and only evaluated a subset of the user tasks which include the following: retrieve carton from storage, open carton, remove white paper cover, remove plastic cover, remove device from clear tray, open cartridge door, remove cartridge from clear tray, insert cartridge in device, and close cartridge door. Discussed below are the two tasks evaluated in which an error occurred.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inadvertent closure of the cartridge door (one error by caregiver)</head><p>The caregiver closed the door while attempting to open it but realized the mistake and stated they would call the support line for help. The caregiver was given a second device to perform the simulation and exhibited successful performance with the second device. The participant reported being nervous and indicated that they interpreted the IFU as instructing to press on the right side of the cartridge door (as opposed to swinging the door to the right). The participant thought the door would act like a medicine cabinet (by pushing the door in to release the lock and then open). This same error was seen in the validation study, and therefore, our recommendation remains unchanged that the Applicant should add this statement</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Close the cartridge door (one error by patient)</head><p>The error of closing the cartridge door was done by a patient as they did not apply enough pressure for it to lock shut and then went on to the next step. The participant did not think any mistakes were made. The patient was told the door was not closed properly at which point the participant stated they "didn't finish" and knew that it clicks when shut. The participant then demonstrated the ability to perform this step successfully by snapping the door closed. Additional information provided by the Applicant on the cartridge door design concludes that a causing the alarm when the door is not fully closed.</p><p>The device has a viewing window allowing the user to see the pre-filled cartridge and to confirm position after the device is removed from the body as instructed in the IFU. This same error was seen in the validation study, and therefore, our recommendation remains unchanged that the Applicant should add this statement "Apply enough pressure when closing the door and make sure a snap is heard before proceeding" to step 2E of the IFU to ensure the door is closed all the way prior to proceeding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">LABLES AND LABELING</head><p>In addition to the human factors study evaluation, DMEPA reviewed the proposed labels and labeling to determine whether there are any significant concerns in terms of safety related to preventable medication errors. We noted that the container labels, carton labeling, Prescribing Information, and Instructions for Use for Repatha pre-filled cartridge and automated mini-doser can be improved to increase the readability and prominence of important information, to promote the safe and effective use of the product, to mitigate any confusion, and to clarify 10 information. We defer to Pharmaceutical Quality/CMC for appropriateness of the term "single use" on the labels and labeling. We provide recommendations in Section 4.1 for the Prescribing Information and 4.2 for the Instructions for Use, container label, and carton labeling to address the concerns.</p><p>In summary, DMEPA expects that patients, caregivers, and health care professionals will be able to use Repatha pre-filled cartridge and automated mini-doser safely and effectively when training is provided and training materials (i.e., Instructions for Use) are available for review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CONCLUSION &amp; RECOMMENDATIONS</head><p>The results of the human factors validation study and the supplemental validation study indicate that there are several areas of improvements necessary with respect to the IFU. The improvements suggested are to enhance key information already in the IFU or add additional information for further clarity. In addition, the proposed container labels and carton labeling can be improved to increase the readability and prominence of important information. Finally, we recommend</p></div>

Highlights of Prescribing Information, Dosage and Administration 1. The ability to administer the 420 mg dose via the automated mini-doser needs to be added to the bullet on administering this dose. For example:  "To administer the 420 mg dose, give 1 Repatha injection using the automated mini-doser with the pre-filled cartridge. Alternatively give 3 Repatha injections using the autoinjector or pre-filled syringe consecutively within 30 minutes." 2. 12 3. Increase the font size of the strength as currently displayed it is not prominent and may be overlooked. 4. Place the strength under the icon of the device on the Principal Display Panel and all side panels to increase readability of this important information. 5. Revise the storage information statement to "Store refrigerated at…." on the Principal Display Panel. We recommend this to increase the prominence of this important information and minimize the risk of the storage information being overlooked and to be consistent with the side panel. 6. On the side panel for the patient/caregiver storage instructions add "Discard after 30 days". We recommend "Discard after" since it is an affirmative statement, and has been shown to result in the desired action. add "__/__/__" to allow users to fill in the actual date. Also, revise the statement to read "Write the date removed from the refrigerator". B. Container Label 1.</p><p>Label i. Replace the name on the label with the conditionally acceptable name of the device.

The nurse trainer followed the IFU and highlighted the steps for device preparation, monitoring, and removal. The nurse held the device in hand and pointed to the device and sections of the IFU as appropriate but did not demonstrate device functionality. After the training walk-through the nurse trainer left the testing room for the remainder of the simulated injection scenario. The trained participants returned a minimum of 5 days later for a second study session lasting up to 1 hour to assess learning decay. Half the participants (n=45) did not receive training and went directly into the simulated injection scenario.</p><p>All participants were asked to perform a simulated injection. They were told to imagine the doctor advised them on the injection site to use, and a skin pad was secured to the assigned location of injection. Half the patients performed the simulated injection into a skin pad attached to their abdomen and the other half performed in into a skin pad attached to their thigh.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Error Alarm/Alert Detection Scenario</head><p>After the simulated injection scenario all participants were asked to perform a simulated device error scenario. For this scenario, the study moderator placed an AMD on the skin pad secured to the assigned injection site and started the injection. Participants were asked to monitor the injection until the injection is completed, and evaluated for their ability to detect the end of a successful injection via the solid green light and hazard alarm via the flashing red light. To effectively test the hazard alarm, devices used for this particular scenario were modified to trigger the alarm, which would occur at some point within the 9 minute injection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deviations</head><p> Total of 3 participants did not complete the simulated device error scenario on the first day of data collection due to failed simulations and a limited supply of extra devices at that time. The failed simulations were determined to be the result of a manufacturing inconsistency of the skin pads used by these particular participants (the outer rubber layer was substantially thicker than the other of the same model), and these specific skins pads were set aside and not used for the remainder of the study.  The participants were provided with cold cartons directly from the refrigerator for the simulated device error scenario (as recommended by Amgen staff) to increase the likelihood of simulating the device failure to test alarm/alert detection.  10 participants were not asked to perform the simulated device error scenario because they were exposed to the error/alarm while performing the simulated injection. 9 out of 10 were the result of a use error on an essential step by the participant and one was the result of an apparent device malfunction.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplemental Summative Study</head><p>A supplemental human factors study was conducted to validate relevant changes to the user interface (UI) since the summative study was conducted. The changes are as follows:   Instructions for Use updated (modified illustrations to address the above, as well enhanced instructions for cartridge insertion, door closing, hand washing, and cleaning of injection site) Participants were self-trained as they were asked to read the IFU prior to the performance of the study.</p><p>During the simulated injection scenario the participants were asked to identify the appropriate injection sites. In order to evaluate the steps required for validation in the supplemental summative study, this scenario was considered complete once the participant had inserted the cartridge and closed the cartridge door, at which point the moderator intervened and asked the participant to continue on to the next study scenario.</p><p>The participants then were presented with scenarios to evaluate the detection of a successful injection and hazard alarm via the indicator light. In this scenario the study moderator placed the automated mini-doser on the skin pad secured to the assigned injection site and started the injection. Participants were asked to monitor the injection until the injection was complete. Participants were evaluated for their ability to detect the end of a successful injection via the solid green light and hazard alarm via the flashing red light. To effectively test the hazard alarm, devices used for this scenario were modified to trigger the alarm, which occurred at some point within the 9 minute injection.  </p></div>

Evolocumab binds to PCSK9 and inhibits circulating PCSK9 from binding to the LDLR on the liver cell surface, thus preventing PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation. The inhibition of PCSK9 by evolocumab leads to increased LDLR expression and subsequent decreased circulating concentrations of LDL-C.</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="4">CLINICAL FILING CHECKLIST FOR BLA 125522/S-001</cell></row><row><cell>BLA Number: 125522/S-001</cell><cell cols="2">Applicant: Amgen</cell><cell>Stamp Date: 9/10/15</cell></row><row><cell>SD: 107/eCTD 0082</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Drug Name:</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>PDUFA Date: 7/10/16 (STD)</cell></row><row><cell>evolocumab/Repatha</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>-</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="3">EILEEN M CRAIG Filing Meeting: Wed 11/05/15; 1-2p; WO 6201 Bldg 22</cell></row><row><cell>07/07/2016 Filing Date: 11/09/15</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Mid-cycle Review Meeting: date pending</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="3">Wrap-up Meeting: date pending JAMES P SMITH Reviews signed-off in DARRTS: 15 May 2016 07/07/2016 Action Goal Date: PDUFA Date: 7/10/16</cell></row><row><cell cols="4">The network location is: \\CDSESUB1\evsprod\BLA125522\0082</cell></row><row><cell>Reviewers</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Clinical:</cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">Eileen Craig/James Smith</cell></row><row><cell>Clin Pharm:</cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">Suryanarayana Sista/Jaya Vaidyanathan</cell></row><row><cell>Pharmacometrics:</cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">Justin Earp/ Nitin Mehrotra</cell></row><row><cell>Biometrics:</cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">Shuxian (Susie) Sinks /Mark Rothmann</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">CMC/Product Quality Reviewers (OBP):</cell><cell cols="2">Sang Bong Lee/Chana Fuchs</cell></row><row><cell>Product Quality Microbiology</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Reviewers:</cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">Lakshmi Narasimhan/Patricia Hughes</cell></row><row><cell>Facility</cell><cell></cell><cell>Laura Fontan</cell></row><row><cell>CDRH (devices):</cell><cell></cell><cell>Alan Stevens</cell></row><row><cell>CDRH OC</cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">Crystal Lewis/Bleta Vuniqi</cell></row><row><cell>Patient Labeling (DMPP):</cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">Sharon Williams/Marcia Britt Williams</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">OSE/DMEPA (labeling/HF/REMS):</cell><cell cols="2">Mishale Mistry/Lena Maslov/Deveonne</cell></row><row><cell>Hamilton-Stokes</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Project Manager:</cell><cell></cell><cell>Kati Johnson</cell></row><row><cell>Background:</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="4">Evolocumab (AMG 145) is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin G2 directed against</cell></row><row><cell cols="3">human proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9).</cell></row><row><cell>Mode of Action</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>When PCSK9 binds</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="4">File name: Clinical Filing Checklist for BLA 125522/S-001 Repatha®/Evolocumab</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>1</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

The AMD was also introduced into the ongoing, phase 3, long-term, open-label extension Study 20120138 in April 2014. Updated data provided herein include all available data from Study 20120138 with a data cut-off date of 02 April 2015. As of the data cutoff date, a total of 255 unique subjects have used the AMD in Study 20120138 to administer evolocumab; 95 subjects used the AMD during year 1 and 196 subjects during year 2+. It should be noted that some subjects may have used the AMD in both year 1 and year 2+, and therefore, the total number of subjects is not additive. Median (min, max) exposure to evolocumab using the AMD was 5.5 months (2.1, 9.0) in year 1 and 5.6 months (0.3, 11.8) in year 2+ of Study 20120138. The device changes are further described in the Device Design Development Documentation in Module 3. The design changes were undertaken during development as a result of observations made during human factors studies, clinical trials and design verification testing.

Here are our requested revisions to the labeling you sent to us via email and official submission on 6/21/2016. Note that we are not requiring that you bold "on-body infusor" on the device pad, however, we will be sending you a "supplement request" letter following approval asking that you increase the prominence of this information compared to the drug name. We also refer to your correspondence, dated and received March 18, 2016, requesting review of your proposed proprietary name, Repatha Pushtronex.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Development and Device Design Changes</head><p>General Comment: CDRH considers on-body medication delivery devices, like the automated mini-doser (AMD) used to deliver Repatha (evolocumab), to be a type of infusion pump. CDRH has issued a guidance document, "FDA Guidance for Industry and Staff: Infusion Pumps Total Product Life Cycle," outlining the types of information expected in a submission for an infusion pump. Since the guidance issued on December 2, 2014, the Agency is expecting submissions for infusion pumps to contain an assurance case. However, we are not going to request that your device documentation be organized into an assurance case for this submission because of the many discussions between Amgen and FDA regarding the submission content for the Repatha AMD product, which preceded the issuing of the FDA infusion pump guidance document. Note that the evidence supporting safety and effectiveness of the device constituent parts must still be present within the submission such that Agency is able to adequately to make a risk/benefit determination. Future submissions for this product or other infusion pump devices of this type will need to address the recommendations contained in the referenced guidance document. This supplemental application proposes to market a new device consisting of a 120 mg/mL prefilled cartridge copackaged with an automated mini-doser (AMD), and associated labeling revisions. The application contains clinical data.</p><p>Unless we notify you within 60 days of the receipt date that the application is not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, we will file the application on November 9, 2015, in accordance with 21 CFR 601.2(a).</p><p>If the application is filed, the user fee goal date will be July 10, 2016. In addition to the registration and reporting requirements described above, FDAAA requires that, at the time of submission of an application under section 351 of the PHS Act, the application must be accompanied by a certification that all applicable requirements of 42 USC § 282(j) have been met. Where available, the certification must include the appropriate National Clinical Trial When submitting the certification for this application, do not include the certification with other submissions to the application. Submit the certification within 30 days of the date of this letter. In the cover letter of the certification submission clearly identify that it pertains to BLA 125522/S-001submitted on September 10, 2015, and that it contains the FDA Form 3674 that was to accompany that application.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COMMENTS/SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:</head><p>Repatha (evolocumab) was approved 8/27/2015 for the treatment of dyslipidemia. It was approved as a prefilled syringe (PFS) and an autoinjector (AI). The firm is now proposing to market an automated mini-doser (AMD) which attaches to the skin and administers a 420 mg dose (once monthly) over an approximately 9 minute timeframe. The assigned reviewer for the initial BLA was Mishale Mistry. This application includes information on the device, results from conducted human factors studies, and proposed labeling. The clinical reviewer on this application is Eileen Craig. Please provide me the name of the assigned reviewer and the RCM#.</p><p>Here is the link to the submission: \\CDSESUB1\evsprod\BLA125522\0082 Thanks for your assistance. <ref type="bibr">SIGNATURE</ref>  </p></div>			</div>
