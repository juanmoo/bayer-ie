<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Condition</head><p>Psoriasis is a common, chronic, immune-mediated skin disorder. The characteristic lesion is a sharply demarcated erythematous plaque with micaceous scale, and the plaques may be localized or widespread in distribution 2 . Psoriasis is a complex autoimmune inflammatory disease that occurs in genetically susceptible individuals. The pathophysiology of psoriasis involves the activation of innate immune cells in the skin, which produce proinflammatory cytokines which trigger and perpetuate the inflammatory cascade 3 .</p><p>In the U.S. and Canada, prevalence as high as 4.6% and 4.7% have been reported, respectively. 2 It is estimated that approximately 7.5 million people in the United States have psoriasis. Approximately 80 percent of those affected with psoriasis have mild to moderate disease, while 20 percent have moderate to severe psoriasis affecting more than 5 percent of the body surface area. The most common form of psoriasis is plaque psoriasis, affecting about 80 to 90 percent of patients with psoriasis 4 .</p><p>Psoriasis can first appear at any age, from infancy to the eighth decade of life. Two peaks in age of onset have been reported: one at 20-30 years of age and a second peak at 50-60 years.</p><p>In approximately 75% of patients, the onset is before the age of 40 years, and in 35-50%, it is before the age of 20 years. The age of onset is earlier in women than in men. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The natural history of psoriasis is chronic with intermittent remissions. Although plaque psoriasis is the most common presentation, other forms of psoriasis include guttate, pustular, erythrodermic, and inverse psoriasis. Psoriasis may affect fingernails and toenails, most frequently in association with psoriatic arthritis. A diagnosis of psoriasis can be made by history and physical examination in the vast majority of cases. The differential diagnosis of psoriasis may include seborrheic dermatitis, lichen simplex chronicus, atopic dermatitis, and nummular eczema. Occasionally, a skin biopsy is performed to rule out other conditions. 2</p><p>The presentation of psoriasis in the pediatric population can be different from that in adults. Psoriasis in infants often presents with involvement of the diaper area. Infants with diaper-area involvement typically develop symmetrical, well-demarcated erythematous patches with little scale. Maceration may be present. Unlike irritant diaper dermatitis, the inguinal folds are usually involved. Affected infants may also have psoriatic plaques in other body areas. These plaques are often smaller and thinner than the psoriatic plaques in adult patients. In children, scalp involvement is a common and often initial presentation of chronic plaque psoriasis. In addition, children with chronic plaque psoriasis are more likely to have facial involvement than adults. 2 A number of comorbid systemic conditions occur more frequently in patients with psoriasis. Examples of these conditions include cardiovascular disease, malignancy, diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, serious infections, and autoimmune disorders. Psychiatric comorbidities associated with psoriasis include depression and suicidal ideation; neurotic, stress-related, or somatoform disorders; and personality and behavioral disorders. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The impact of psoriasis on the daily lives of patients was among the topics discussed at a Patient-Focused Drug Development Meeting for psoriasis held by the Agency on March 17, 2016. Patients who attended the meeting described severe physical, social and emotional impact including: depression, anxiety, limitations on activities, embarrassment, stigma, and social discrimination. Patients shared their experiences with currently available therapies, and they described varying degrees of success in managing symptoms with these therapies.</p><p>Patients stressed need to enhance the treatment armamentarium, given current challenges with variability in effectiveness, tolerability, access to available treatments, and uncertainty regarding long-term effects of available treatments.</p><p>Psoriasis is a chronic, debilitating disease with significant impacts on the lives of affected patients. At the Patient Focused Drug Development meeting, patients discussed current challenges with variability in effectiveness, tolerability, access to available treatments, and uncertainty regarding long-term effects of available treatments. Therefore, development of additional safe and effective therapies continues to be an important goal. This is especially true for certain subgroups of patients with psoriasis, such as women during pregnancy and pediatric patients.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of Presubmission/Submission Regulatory Activity</head><p>The applicant submitted a protocol on July 27, 2010 for a Phase 2 dose-ranging trial (Trial P05495, later re-designated P003), to evaluate 4 doses (5, 25, 100, 200 mg) of their product against placebo. In the advice letter dated December 17, 2010, the Agency recommended that the primary efficacy endpoint be success on PGA where success is defined as a score of 0 ("Cleared") or 1 ("Almost Clear") with at least 2-grade improvement from baseline and PASI may be used as a secondary endpoint.</p><p>At the Guidance meeting on June 1, 2011, the Agency advised the applicant of the need to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of their to-be-marketed drug product (rather than the lyophilized powder drug product formulation used in early trials) in the target patient population. The Agency also advised the applicant regarding optimal timepoints during the Phase 3 trials for collection of samples for drug concentrations and immunogenicity. The Agency noted the applicant's plan to use the pre-filled syringe (PFS) presentation in the Phase 3 trials as well as their plan to instruct subjects to perform self-administration of study drug after the first 2 injections. The Agency recommended that the applicant conduct a dedicated human factors usability study for the PFS in addition to the Phase 3 trials. During the EOP2 meeting, the applicant agreed to include success on PGA at Week 12 as a coprimary endpoint with PASI 75 at Week 12 in their Phase 3 trials. The Agency recommended that the applicant propose a definition for relapse/rebound during the maintenance period based on PGA as well as PASI 75 so that the same endpoints are used throughout the various periods of the trial. The Agency also provided advice regarding documentation and adjudication of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). In addition, the Agency provided advice regarding the applicant's proposed anti-drug antibody (ADA) assay, and recommended the use of a cell-based biological assay for the detection of neutralizing antibodies.</p><p>Regarding device development, at the EOP2 meeting the Agency offered detailed advice regarding the applicant's proposed Human Factors Study.</p><p>The following briefly summarizes the statistical comments provided to the applicant regarding their Phase 3 trials and EOP2 meeting package:</p><p>The Agency commented that the proposed stepwise method to control multiplicity does not fully control the Type I error rate. The Agency commented that there was insufficient information to provide concurrence on the applicant's proposed interim futility analysis and requested more detail on the statistical methodology. It should be noted that the interim analysis was removed from all Phase 3 protocols after the EOP2 meeting. Trial P012 did not include a placebo arm and the Agency commented that this trial should include a placebo to avoid potential issues in interpreting trial findings.</p><p>The Agency commented that randomization should be stratified by center and the analysis should account for such stratification. In addition, the Agency recommended the applicant reduce the number of centers and enroll a minimum number of subjects per arm per center (i.e., 8 subjects). For handling missing data, the applicant proposed imputing missing data as non-responders as the primary imputation method and using LOCF as a sensitivity analysis. Since the justification for LOCF is limited, the Agency stated that the applicant provide their rationale for LOCF or propose an alternate method. In addition, the Agency noted that imputing missing data as non-responders and LOCF will produce similar results; therefore, the Agency recommended including a sensitivity analysis that uses an alternate framework from the primary imputation method.</p><p>The applicant submitted three Phase 3 protocols (Trials P010, P011, and P012) for Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) on June 8, 2012. Since all three protocols were different, three separate SPA letters (Agreement letters) were sent to the applicant on July 18, 2012. It should be noted that all the comments conveyed in the SPA letter for Trial P011 were also conveyed in the SPA letter for Trial P012 except for two comments that dealt with the maintenance period (the first 28-weeks Trial P011 and Trial P012 are identical). The Agency reiterated the comments from the EOP2 meeting regarding the definition of relapse/rebound, randomization, and the handling of missing data. The Agency recommended the primary analysis population be the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as all randomized subjects (the applicant proposed requiring subjects have at least one dose of study treatment to be included). For Trials P011 and P012, the Agency recommended the placebo arm continue to Week 28 as the applicant planned to establish an efficacy claim related to tildrakizumab vs. etanercept at Week 28.</p><p>The applicant provided responses to all of the <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Non-Agreements and Additional Comments for  Trial P010, and submitted an amended protocol for Trial P010 based on their responses on  September 20, 2012. On October 26, 2012, the applicant provided responses to all of the Non-Agreements and Additional Comments for Trials P011 and P012, and submitted an amended  for only Trial P011</ref>. Advice letters for all three trials were sent to the applicant on March 14, 2013. While the Agency acknowledged the applicant's responses regarding the randomization and number of centers (i.e., not stratify by center and not reducing the number of centers), not having the placebo arm continue to Week 28 in Trials P011 and P012, and not using the ITT population as the primary analysis population, the Agency still reiterated their recommendations regarding these issues.</p><p>A Guidance meeting was scheduled for April 22, 2015; however, after receiving the pre-meeting communication, the applicant cancelled the meeting and stated that the guidance provided by the Agency was clear and that further discussion was not necessary. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the applicant's proposed revised developmental program. The applicant stated:</p><p>"The company has modified the scope of the Phase 3 program and is conducting two of the previously-proposed Phase 3 studies (Protocols P010 and P011). The company does not plan to conduct Protocol P012 and does not intend to seek a comparative efficacy claim vs. etanercept."</p><p>For the guidance meeting on April 22, 2015, the applicant asked whether the revised safety database (i.e., without Trial P012) would be sufficient to support a BLA. The Agency commented that the size of the proposed safety database ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_90">Table 2</ref> in meeting package) may be acceptable if the adverse reaction profile is comparable to that seen in the Phase 2 program. In addition, the Agency stated that if the actual numbers are less than proposed, then additional data may be needed.</p><p>On November 24, 2015, the applicant submitted amended protocols for Trials P010 and P011. In the amended protocols, the applicant proposed to include PASI 90 and PASI 100 as key secondary efficacy endpoints and modified the multiplicity testing strategy (i.e., a sequential gatekeeping approach) to include these endpoints. An advice letter regarding this submission was sent to the applicant on December 29, 2015. In the advice letter, the Agency stated that the proposal to include PASI 90 and PASI 100 at Week 12 as key secondary efficacy endpoints in Trials P010 and P011 is acceptable. In addition, the Agency stated:</p><p>"As you have decided not to conduct Trial P012 and, consequently, not seek a comparative efficacy claim against etanercept, we recommend that you consider modifying your multiplicity testing strategy for Trial P011 such that all comparisons of tildrakizumab against placebo come before comparisons against etanercept."</p><p>The applicant submitted an initial Pediatric Study Plan (iPSP) on December 11, 2015. The Agency sent a Written Response to the applicant's iPSP on March 10, 2016. The applicant submitted an agreed iPSP on May 20, 2016. In the agreed iPSP, the applicant requested a partial waiver for studies in children younger than 6 years of age on the grounds that necessary studies are impossible or highly impractical due to the extremely low prevalence of moderate to severe psoriasis in this population. The applicant also requested deferral of studies in pediatric subjects age 6 years to less than 18 years until safety and efficacy in the adult indication have We have approved the stability protocols in your license application for the purpose of extending the expiration dating of your drug substance and drug product under 21 CFR 601.12.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanism of Action (MoA):</head><p>Tildrakizumab binds specifically to IL-23p19 and blocks interaction with IL-23R. IL-23 is a naturally occurring cytokine known to be involved with multiple inflammatory pathways. Engagement of IL-23R by IL-23 leads to JAK2-mediated phosphorylation of tyrosine residues. This initiates downstream signaling cascade where STAT3 is recruited and homodimered. A signal from the phosphorylated homodimer STAT3 complex is sent to the nucleus to induce a transcription of the inflammatory cytokines, IL-17. IL-17 activates inflammatory pathways associated with psoriasis. Tildrakizumab binds to the p19 subunit of IL-23 and binds to IL-23 molecules and prevents its interaction with the IL-23R, blocking the downstream signaling cascade.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Potency Assay:</head><p>The potency assay is a cell-based assay that measures neutralization of soluble IL-23. In the assay, tildrakizumab binds to IL-23 via its p19 subunit preventing IL-23 binding to the IL-23R, resulting in inhibition of IL-23-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. Cells are lysed and p-STAT3 is measured by ELISA. The loss of signal from the ELISA from the neutralization activity of tildrakizumab is dose-dependent and is reported as a relative percentage of the activity of the reference standard.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Executive Summary</head><p>Tildrakizumab is a humanized recombinant IgG1/ monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of human interleukin 23 (IL-23p19) and blocks the interaction of IL-23 with the IL-23 receptor. Neutralization of IL-23 in a humanized mouse model of psoriasis shows therapeutic effects. Tildrakizumab does not bind to human IL-12 or rodent IL-23. Monkey is the only pharmacologically relevant species and was used in toxicology studies.</p><p>In a 3-month repeat dose toxicity study, subcutaneous (SC) doses of 0 (vehicle), 40, and 140 mg/kg and intravenous (IV) doses of 140 mg/kg tildrakizumab were administered to cynomolgus monkeys once every two weeks for 3 months. No significant adverse effects were noted. In a 9-month repeat dose toxicity study, SC doses of 0 (vehicle), 10, and 100 mg/kg tildrakizumab were administered to cynomolgus monkeys once every two weeks for 9 months. No significant adverse effects were noted. The NOAELs identified in the two studies were the highest dose tested in both studies. The high dose in the 9-month study, 100 mg/kg, is 45 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), based on AUC comparison.</p><p>The effects on fertility were assessed by examination of reproductive organs in the repeat dose toxicity studies. No adverse effects were noted. In an embryofetal developmental study, SC doses of 0, 10, 100 and 300 mg/kg tildrakizumab were administered to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys once every two weeks during gestation days 20-118. No maternal or embryofetal toxicities were observed. The NOAEL, 300 mg/kg, is 79 times the MRHD. Tildrakizumab crossed the placenta in monkeys.</p><p>In a pre-and postnatal developmental study, SC doses of 0, 10, and 100 mg/kg tildrakizumab were administered to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys once every two weeks from gestation day 50 to parturition. No significant maternal toxicity was noted. Seven infants died or were euthanized within 15 days of age: 1/12 in the control group, 2/12 in the low dose group, and 4/14 in the high dose group. While the overall fetal/infant losses were within the historical control range, the deaths of 2 high dose infants (histopathology examination suggested viral infection) were considered as possibly related to tildrakizumab treatment. No tildrakizumabrelated adverse effects were noted in the remaining infants from birth through 6 months of age. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was identified as 100 mg/kg (30 times the MRHD) and the NOAEL for developmental toxicity was identified as 10 mg/kg (3 times the MRHD).</p><p>No genetic toxicology or carcinogenicity studies were conducted with tildrakizumab. The applicant provided a carcinogenic risk assessment, mainly using information from published literature. The nonclinical information does not suggest an increased carcinogenic risk associated with the use of tildrakizumab. However, the relevance of various animal models to humans is unknown.</p><p>This BLA is approvable from a Pharmacology/Toxicology perspective.

An analysis of the crystal structure of the antigen binding fragment F(ab) of tildrakizumab bound to human IL-23 shows that the epitope of tildrakizumab on human IL-23 is primarily on the p19 subunit of IL-23 (IL-23p19), with limited interaction with the IL-12/23p40 subunit. As assessed by surface plasmon resonance (Biacore) and indirect ELISA techniques, tildrakizumab does not bind to human IL-12 (IL-12/23p40 and IL-12p35 heterodimer) or the human IL-12/23p40 monomer. The ability of tildrakizumab to neutralize the biological activity of human IL-23 in vitro was measured in three different assays. In all three assays (using a transfected BAF/3 cell line, primary human splenocytes, and a KIT225 leukemic T-cell line, respectively), tildrakizumab showed consistent and reproducible inhibition of IL-23-induced biological activity, with IC 50 values ranging from 59 to 187 pM.</p><p>Tildrakizumab binds to cynomolgus monkey IL-23 with higher affinity (Kd: 47 pM) than human IL-23. In the KIT225 assay tildrakizumab neutralized the biological activity of cynomolgus monkey IL-23 with an IC 50 of 118 pM (comparable to the IC 50 of 130 pM in the assay with human IL-23), demonstrating that cynomolgus monkey is a pharmacologically relevant species. Tildrakizumab does not bind to mouse or rat IL-23 (no detectable binding). A surrogate mouse anti-mouse IL-23p19 IgG1 mAb, SCH 900598, was developed and used in in vivo pharmacology studies. SCH 900598 binds relatively weakly to mouse IL-23 (Kd: ~3-6 nM) and shows lower potency in in vitro assays (IC 50 ranging from 8 to 11 nM).</p><p>The anatomical distribution of IL-23p19, its two receptor subunits (IL-23R and IL-12R 1), and IL-12/23p40 was assessed by quantitative gene expression in normal human, cynomolgus monkey, and mouse tissues. The general pattern of the IL-12/23p40 and IL-23p19 subunits and the IL-23R and IL-12R 1 receptor expression were similar among human, monkey, and mouse, with low level expression detected primarily in the immune tissues and in the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>The applicant conducted a number of nonclinical studies using various infection models and also provided a number of literature references to address the infection risk of anti-IL-23p19 treatment. The study results suggest that IL-23 neutralization with an anti-IL-23p19 antibody appeared to be less immunosuppressive than the neutralization of both IL-23 and IL-12 with an anti-IL-12/23p40 antibody. From the nonclinical data it appears that the infection risk associated with IL-23 neutralization is less than that associated with IL-12+IL-23 neutralization. However, IL-23 does play a role in host defense and anti-IL-23p19 treatment may still impose an infection risk. The relevance of various animal models, especially the knockout models, to humans is not clear. The final assessment of infection risk will be conducted based on the results of clinical trials.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fertility and Early Embryonic Development</head><p>Per the ICH S6(R1) guidance, as nonhuman primates (NHPs) are the only relevant species, the potential for effects on male and female fertility can be assessed by examination of reproductive tract in repeat dose toxicity studies of at least 3 months duration using sexually mature NHPs. The applicant provided the number of sexually mature females and sexually mature/peripubertal males in the 3-month and 9-month repeat dose monkey studies in the table below (copied from submission). No tildrakizumab-related effects on hormone parameters (estrogen and progesterone) or histological findings in reproductive organs were noted in sexually mature monkeys in the repeat dose toxicity studies described in Section 5.5.1. It would be preferable if more sexually mature males were evaluated, especially in the 9-month study. However, considering that there were no histopathological findings in male reproductive organs that could elicit a concern, the evaluation on both male and female fertility is acceptable. The NOAEL for fertility was identified as 140 mg/kg/dose, the high dose tested in the 3-month toxicity study. See SC doses of 0 (vehicle: same as in Study 1), 10, 100 and 300 mg/kg/dose tildrakizumab were administered to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys (12 females/group) once every 2 weeks, during gestation day (GD) 20-118 (comprising the period of organogenesis and the second and third trimesters).

There were no test article-related effects on fetal organ weight. There were no test article-related fetal visceral findings or fetal skeletal findings.</p><p>No significant maternal toxicity or embryofetal toxicity was noted.

A total of 11 BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation -BLA 761067 ILUMYA (tildrakizumab) injection, for subcutaneous use 58 infants in the control group, 12 infants in the low dose group, and 13 infants in the high dose group were delivered by natural birth; and 1 control infant and 1 high dose infant were delivered by C-section. The gestation length at delivery was comparable between the control and dose groups.</p><p>Seven infants died or were euthanized within 15 days of age: 1/12 (8%) in the control group, 2/12 (17%) in the low dose group, and 4/14 (29%) in the high dose group. In 5 of the 7 cases, the cause of infant death was related to lack of maternal care. While the overall fetal/infant losses were within the historical control range, the deaths of 2 high dose infants (found dead on birth day 12 and 15) were considered as possibly related to tildrakizumab treatment. At necropsy, generalized yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes and sclera consistent with icterus was observed in both infants. Histopathological examination showed diffuse degeneration/necrosis of hepatocytes and disorganization and collapse of the liver parenchyma. In kidney, very slight vacuolation or slight necrosis were noted in tubular epithelial cells. Eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies were observed in the renal cortical tubular epithelial cells. Very slight or marked lymphoid depletion in the thymus and moderate depletion of the spleen were also noted. These histopathological findings suggested viral infection.</p><p>For infants surviving through 6 months of age to scheduled necropsy, no significant treatmentrelated adverse findings were noted in any of the parameters examined, including clinical observations, physical examinations, body weights, morphometric measurements, external assessments, neurobehavioral evaluations, clinical pathology, lymphocyte phenotyping evaluation (flow cytometry), T-cell dependent antibody response (TDAR), or evaluation at necropsy (organ weights, gross pathology and histopathology evaluation).</p><p>The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was identified as the high dose, 100 mg/kg/dose once every two weeks. Considering the relationship to tildrakizumab could not be ruled out for the two infant deaths possibly due to viral infection at high dose, the NOAEL for developmental toxicity was identified as the low dose, 10 mg/kg/dose once every two weeks administered to maternal animals. See <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">Table 7</ref> for TK information for maternal monkeys.</p><p>In addition, tildrakizumab milk/maternal monkey serum concentration ratios are shown in the table below (copied from submission). The tildrakizumab excretion in breast milk was minimal. Tildrakizumab infant/maternal monkey serum concentration ratios are shown in the table below (copied from submission). The TK data showed that tildrakizumab crossed placenta during pregnancy. Anti-tildrakizumab antibodies were observed in one maternal monkey at low dose and one maternal monkey at high dose.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.1.1">Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamics</head><p>Tildrakizumab is a humanized IgG1/k monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of IL-23 and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor. IL-23 is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in inflammatory and immune responses. Tildrakizumab inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of tildrakizumab in subjects with psoriasis has not been characterized. The absolute bioavailability of tildrakizumab was estimated to be 73-80% following SC injection. The geometric mean (CV%) systemic clearance was 0.32 L/day (38%) and the half-life was approximately 23 days (23%) in subjects with psoriasis. The geometric mean (CV%) volume of distribution is 10.8 L (24%) in subjects with psoriasis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.1.3.">Drug interactions</head><p>The applicant conducted clinical drug interaction Study P009 to evaluate the effect of tildrakizumab, 200 mg administered SC at Weeks 0 and 4, on the PK of caffeine (metabolized by CYP1A2), warfarin (metabolized by CYP2C9), omeprazole (metabolized by CYP2C19), dextromethorphan (metabolized by CYP2D6), and midazolam (metabolized by CYP3A4) coadministered as a cocktail in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis. The PK results suggest that the potential for a clinically relevant drug interaction for drugs metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 may be low. The greatest exposure change was observed for dextromethorphan, where the AUC inf was increased by 20%.</p><p>Overall, the drug interaction study results support that upon initiation or discontinuation of tildrakizumab in patients who are receiving concomitant CYP2D6 substrates, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index, clinicians may consider monitoring for therapeutic effect or drug concentration and consider dosage adjustment as needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.1.4">Immunogenicity</head><p>Up to Week 64, approximately 6.8% of subjects treated with tildrakizumab at the proposed 100 mg dosage regimen developed antibodies to tildrakizumab. Of the subjects who developed antibodies to tildrakizumab, approximately 40% had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). Neutralizing antibodies to tildrakizumab were associated with reduced drug concentrations and reduced efficacy. Subjects who developed antibodies to tildrakizumab were more likely to experience hypersensitivity or injection-site reactions compared to subjects who were antibody negative.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.2.2.">Therapeutic individualization</head><p>Therapeutic individualization based on intrinsic factors is not necessary. Population PK analysis identified body weight as a significant covariate on tildrakizumab PK; tildrakizumab concentration was lower in subjects with higher body weight. Body weight also showed an impact on efficacy; subjects with higher body weight were associated with a lower response rate than subjects with lower body weight at the same dose (see section 6.3.2.3). However, dose adjustment based on body weight is not necessary based on the available efficacy data in Phase 3 trials. Exposure-response analysis further showed that there is no preferential treatment benefit with 200 mg dose in any particular subset of patients including subjects with high body weight.</p></div>

In addition, one subject in Trial P010 was randomized to placebo but discontinued from the trial prior to receiving study product; therefore, this subject was not included in the FAS. For Trial P011, a total of 53 subjects did not meet the key inclusion criteria related to disease severity: 36 subjects had a PGA score &lt; 3 (moderate), 13 subjects had a PASI score &lt; 12, 1 subject had a BSA &lt; 10%, 2 subjects had both a PGA score &lt; 3 (moderate) and a PASI score &lt; 12, and 1 subject had both a PGA score &lt; 3 (moderate) and a BSA &lt; 10%.

The proportion of subjects with missing data for Week 12 was slightly higher in Trial P011 compared to Trial P010. For both trials, the primary method for handling missing data specified in the protocols was nonresponder imputation (NRI). The protocols specified the following two sensitivity analyses for the handling of missing data: (i) impute missing data using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach and (ii) impute missing data using multiple imputation (MI). The statistical reviewer conducted an additional sensitivity analysis under the worst case scenario (i.e., missing data for tildrakizumab is imputed as non-responders and missing data for placebo is imputed as responders). <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">Table 27</ref> presents the results for the co-primary efficacy endpoints in both trials by the various imputation methods.

Subjects with missing baseline value were also imputed using NRI. The applicant's results for the secondary efficacy endpoints at Week 28 differ from the above because the applicant excluded subjects that did not enter Part 2 (i.e., subjects that discontinued prior to Week 12 were not included in the applicant's analysis). These subjects are included in the above results as non-responders. The protocols for Trials P010 and P011 specified a sequential gatekeeping approach to control the Type I error rate for testing multiple doses and efficacy endpoints (i.e., <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> and <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> in Section 7.2.2). <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 30</ref> presents the ordering and corresponding p-values for the co-primary and secondary efficacy endpoints included in the multiplicity testing strategy.</p><p>Reference ID: 4233639 . As all of the endpoints based on the PROs were designated as either "other" secondary endpoints or exploratory endpoints and were not included in the multiplicity testing strategy, the results for these endpoints are not presented in this review. Trial P010 evaluated maintenance of efficacy for an additional 36 weeks (Weeks 28 to 64). Subjects randomized to tildrakizumab (200 and 100 mg) at Week 0 and who were PASI 75 responders at Week 28 were re-randomized to either continue treatment with the same dose of tildrakizumab Q12W or withdrawn therapy. Subjects re-randomized to treatment withdrawal received placebo Q4W till relapse, which was defined as the reduction in maximum PASI response by 50%. Subjects that relapsed re-initiated their original dose of tildrakizumab at the visit when the relapse occurred; subsequent dosing of tildrakizumab was given 4 weeks after treatment re-initiation, and Q12W thereafter through Week 64. It should be noted that the Agency recommended that the definition of relapse also be based on PGA (see Section 3.1). <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 31</ref> presents the percentage of PASI 75 responders at Week 28 who were responders at Week 64.

In both trials, the majority of subjects were less than 65 years of age (approximately 91%); therefore, any differences between the two subgroups would be difficult to detect. For sex, the treatment effect was larger in females compared to males for both co-primary efficacy endpoints in Trial P010; however, there was more variability in the treatment effects across in Trial P011. In both trials, the sample size for the non-White subgroups (i.e., Black, Asian [small in Trial P011], and Other) were relatively small. In Trial P010, the treatment effect for subjects that identify as White was larger than those that identify as Asian. For weight, the treatment effect was larger in those that weighed 90 kg compared to &gt; 90 kg in both trials; however, it should be noted that the results within each subgroup were similar between the two tildrakizumab doses. For baseline disease severity, the treatment effect tended to be larger for subjects with less disease severity at baseline (i.e., PGA score of 3 [moderate]) in both trials; however, it should be noted that the sample size for the very high disease severity (i.e., PGA score of 5 [very severe]) was relatively small.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Review of Safety Safety Review Approach</head><p>The primary review of safety of tildrakizumab for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis focused on the evaluation of pooled data from Phase 2 Trial P05495 (P003) and Phase 3 Trials MK-3222 P010 (P010) and MK-3222 P011 (P011).</p><p>Phase 2 Trial P05495 (P003) was a 5-arm trial [tildrakizumab (5 mg, 25 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg) and placebo]. The study product was administered at Week 0, 4, 16, 28, 40 and 52 by SC injection at the study site. A total of 270 subjects age 18 to 82 years of age were randomized in a 1:2:2:2:1 ratio.. At Week 16, the dose was adjusted based on the responder status (e.g., "nonresponders" received an increased dose and "responders" received the same or decreased dose.) Subjects received their assigned treatment until Week 52 and then received no treatment during the wash-out period until Week 72. Refer to <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 19</ref> Listing of Clinical Trials Relevant to BLA 761067.</p><p>Phase 3 Trial P010 and Trial P011 were similar in terms of design, study population, doses evaluated (100 mg and 200 mg SC), dosing regimen, primary endpoints and key secondary endpoints. The Base Periods consisted of three parts with an optional long-term safety extension, and a follow-up period. Both trials included a placebo comparator through Week 12 (Part 1). In addition, Trial P011 also included an active comparator, etanercept 18 up to Week 28. Subjects who were assigned to placebo in Part 1 were re-randomized to receive tildrakizumab 100 mg or 200 mg at Week 12 (Part 2: Week 12-28). From Week 28 (Part 3: P010 Weeks 28-64 and P011 Weeks 28-52), treatment assignment was based on the responder status. For a description treatment groups after Week 28, detailed study designs and schematic representations refer to Section 7.2.1.</p><p>The Long-Term Safety Extension (Weeks 64 to 256) followed Part 3. Eligible subjects continued to receive the same dose as Part 3 (200 or 100 mg Q12W). Subjects who were not eligible or who elected not to enter the extension trial entered a 20-week follow-up period. Subjects received treatment in a double-blind manner until the base trail (Parts 1, 2, and 3) was completed. Following database lock of the base study, subjects received study medication in an open-label manner for the remainder of the extension trial.</p><p>In the pooled safety database (Trial P003, Trial P010 and Trial P011), a total of 1083 subjects with plaque psoriasis were treated with the proposed dose and dosing regimen of tildrakizumab 100 mg administered SC, at Weeks 0 and 4 and then q12W thereafter. Of these, 672 subjects were exposed for at least 12 months, 587 for 18 months, and 469 for 24 months.</p><p>The analysis of the safety of tildrakizumab in adults with moderate to severe psoriasis was performed using 5 pools of safety data representing different treatment periods as follows:</p><p>The mean duration of treatment was 53.9 weeks for tildrakizumab during the Base trial periods, corresponding to an exposure of 2059.04 subject-years. A total of 588 subjects received placebo during the Base trial periods. The mean duration of treatment with placebo was 19.4 weeks, corresponding to an exposure of 218.86 subject-years. During the Base and Extension trial periods, the mean duration of treatment with tildrakizumab was 91.7 weeks, corresponding to an exposure duration of 3505.39 subject-years.</p><p>The 120 Day Safety Update Report (SUR) was received 10/2/2017. In the SUR, the applicant reported an updated mean duration of treatment with tildrakizumab of 108.1 weeks, with a total exposure of 4130.24 subject-years during the Base and Extension trial periods.</p><p>During the Base period of Trials P003, P010, and P011, the number of subjects treated with the proposed dose of tildrakizumab 100 mg was 1083. The number of subjects treated with the proposed dose of tildrakizumab 200 mg was 1041. This safety database is sufficient to evaluate the safety of tildrakizumab for the proposed indication in the target population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relevant characteristics of the safety population:</head><p>Demographic characteristics of the subject population in the tildrakizumab development program are presented in greater detail in Section 7.2.1.3 of this review. A brief summary of demographic information relevant to the evaluation of safety will be presented here.</p><p>In Trial P003, P010, and P011, the subjects were mostly White (81.8%) and male (71.4%). The median age was 46.0 years (range 18-82 years). Across these 3 trials, 8.9% of subjects were 65 years of age or older.</p><p>In the Phase 2/3 population, the mean baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score was 20.0 (standard deviation [SD] 7.7). The baseline Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) Score was 3 in 65.9% and 4 in 33.7% of subjects. The median body surface area (BSA) involved was 26% (range 5-100%).</p><p>Most subjects (82.5%) had no prior exposure to biologic therapy and most (84.1%) reported no history of psoriatic arthritis. A total of 40.2% of subjects had a history of treatment with conventional systemic therapy, and 31.6% had a history of treatment with phototherapy.</p><p>In the Phase 2/3 population, the medical histories of the trial population were remarkable for cardiovascular risk factors:</p><p>Hypertension (27.1%), hyperlipidemia (6.4%), and hypercholesterolemia (6.0%) Obesity (6.8%) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (5.1%)</p><p>The medical histories were also remarkable for psoriatic arthropathy (10.8%) and back pain (4.8%). Less than 1% of subjects reported a history of squamous cell (SCC) or basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the skin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adequacy of the safety database:</head><p>The total exposure to tildrakizumab 100 mg and 200 mg SC at Week 0 and 4, then every 12 weeks thereafter for 52 weeks, provides adequate data for the evaluation of safety. The demographics of the study population are sufficiently representative of the target population.</p><p>Therefore, the safety database presented by the applicant is sufficient to characterize the safety profile of tildrakizumab for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adequacy of Applicant's Clinical Safety Assessments</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Issues Regarding Data Integrity and Submission Quality</head><p>Overall, the quality of the data submitted is adequate to characterize the safety and efficacy of tildrakizumab. Data quality and fitness were evaluated in conjunction with the JumpStart team. We discovered no significant deficiencies that would impede a thorough analysis of the data presented by the applicant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Categorization of Adverse Events</head><p>The definitions and collection of adverse events (AE) were similar among all the trials, each of which recorded spontaneously reported AEs. For example, the following definitions were adapted from those in Trial P010. The applicant defined and AE as "any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment." An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to this medicinal product.</p><p>AEs were categorized by system-organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The adverse events included in analyses performed by the JumpStart team matched 100% to MedDRA dictionary version 19.1. The coding of adverse events in the BLA submission appeared adequate and allowed for accurate estimation of AE risks.</p><p>All AEs were to be recorded in the subject's source documentation and on the CRF. The onset and end dates, severity, and relationship to the investigational product were recorded for each AE. Any action or outcome (e.g., discontinuation of therapy) was also recorded for each AE.</p><p>The following definitions were used for grading the severity of AEs:</p><p>Mild: awareness of sign, symptom, or event, but easily tolerated; Moderate: discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity and may have warranted intervention; or Severe: incapacitating with inability to do usual activities or significantly affected clinical status, and warranted intervention</p><p>The investigator also assessed the relationship of any AE to the use of the trial medication, based on available information and according to the following guidelines: Adjudication of major CV events and all deaths was conducted by external committees. Tier 2 AEs constituted the commonly occurring AEs in at least 4 subjects in any treatment group. Tier 2 AEs included:</p><p>Percentage of subjects with AEs (not including worsening of underlying psoriasis unless it meets criteria for an SAE). Percentage of subjects with SAEs. Percentage of subjects with drug-related AEs (i.e., AEs considered by the investigator to be at least possibly associated with blinded trial medication). Percentage of subjects with a discontinuation due to AEs. Percentage of subjects reporting specific AEs. Percentage of subjects discontinuing trial medication due to drug-related AEs. Percentage of subjects who died. Percentage of subjects with anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) associated with AEs.</p><p>Other AEs of clinical interest included:</p><p>Overdose An elevated AST or ALT lab value that was 3 × the ULN and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that was 2 × ULN and, at the same time, an ALP lab value that was &lt;2 × ULN Nonserious infections requiring IV antibiotics</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypertension requiring emergency room visit</head><p>Any other AEs including laboratory assessments not analyzed in Tier 1 and Tier 2 were considered Tier 3 safety endpoints. Summary statistics and incidence rates were provided for the Tier 3 endpoints. Additionally, any nonserious events of infections that required IV antibiotics but did not meet the definition of an SAE were considered "closely monitored" events during the trial and are a subset of Tier 1 events. The applicant also performed analyses of exposure-response for safety as well as the effect of immunogenicity on safety.</p><p>The definition of AE, TEAE, and SAE are acceptable. The classification system used by investigators to describe the severity of AE as well as the causal relationship between AE and study product are also acceptable. The applicant's identification and presentation of AE of special interest was appropriate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Routine Clinical Tests</head><p>In Trial P003, P010 and P011, the evaluation of safety was conducted during visits to the clinic, which were scheduled to occur at the following timepoints: The evaluation of safety included clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECG), and evaluation for TB. These will be discussed in more detail below. Safety monitoring also included recording of adverse events, which was discussed in the previous section. In all three trials, serum pregnancy testing was performed at screening for women of childbearing potential. In addition, urine pregnancy testing was performed at the following timepoints: Because the 3 trials had different visit schedules, for the purpose of comparison of results across time, only the trial visits common across the Phase 2 and 3 trials are summarized. Common time points for measurement of ECG parameters across the Phase 2/3 trials during the base period were Weeks 0, 4, 12, 28, and 52/64.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deaths</head><p>There were no deaths reported in the 6 Phase 1 trials in subjects receiving tildrakizumab (P05661, P05776, P06306, P05382, P009, and P05839).</p><p>During the Base Periods of the pooled Phase 2 (Base period: 52 weeks) and Phase 3 trials (Base periods P010: 64 weeks and P011: 52 weeks), a total of 7 subjects experienced fatal adverse events. There were five deaths among subjects who received 100 mg tildrakizumab [unknown cause, alcoholic cardiomyopathy and steatohepatitis]; 1 death in a subject who received tildrakizumab 200 mg [aneurysm]; and 1 death in a subject who received etanercept in Part 1 but switched to tildrakizumab 200 mg in Part 3 of the trial [sepsis]. None of the deaths was assessed as causally related to the study product. In the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC, there was an imbalance in the incidence of SAEs in the tildrakizumab 100 mg group (diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, diverticulitis, dyspepsia, gastritis, thrombosed hemorrhoids, esophageal polyp and pancreatitis) compared with the placebo group (food poisoning). There was no apparent dose response in GI SAEs. By comparison, there was a dose response in the incidence of SAEs in the Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorder SOC; more than twice the number of subjects reported SAEs who received tildrakizumab 200 mg than tildrakizumab 100 mg. This imbalance in the rate of SAEs by dose was confirmed in subjects who received continuous treatment, with tildrakizumab 200 mg compared to 100 mg.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selected narratives of serious adverse events</head><p>The following SAEs were assessed as related to the study product and resulted in discontinuation from the trial:</p><p>A 58-year-old Asian male with a history of chronic cough, abnormal chest x-ray, negative transbronchial needle biopsy and negative Mantoux tuberculin skin test, tobacco usage (11 pack years) and low back pain experienced severe back pain on an unknown day.

On Day 37, the subject experienced a headache and was hospitalized. ECG showed sinus rhythm, with first degree atrioventricular block, and no ischemia. Electroencephalogram and a magnetic resonance tomography were unremarkable. Laboratory results included an elevated neutrophil count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The subject improved the same day and was released from the hospital with a diagnosis of corticoid responsive bilateral cephalalgia which was treated with prednisolone from Day 39 to Day 60 when the event of headache resolved. The headache was assessed as severe in intensity and related to study medication. The subject was withdrawn from the trial on Day 47.</p><p>A 74-year-old White male with a history of obesity, nephrolithiasis, tobacco usage (7.5 pack years), and prostatic hyperplasia experience hematuria on Day 155 and 256 and was diagnosed with serious adverse event of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder stage 0 after 4 doses for tildrakizumab 100 mg. On Day 271, the subject was hospitalized for diagnostic transurethral surgical procedure. The tumor identified in the bladder was resected and diagnosed as non-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma (G2 high grade pTa). The subject was withdrawn from the trial. The neoplasm resolved with the diagnostic procedure. The neoplasm was assessed as severe in intensity and related to study medication.</p><p>A 74-year-old White female with a history of diabetes experienced a serious, drug-related adverse event of herpes zoster after 2 doses of tildrakizumab 200 mg. On Day 107, the subject was hospitalized with erythema, blistering, pain and pruritus in the distribution of the right trigeminal nerve. There was periorbital erythema which involved the conjunctiva. The subject was diagnosed with herpes zoster V1 + V2 and treated with acyclovir, eye drops and pain medication. The event appeared to be resolved on Day 118 but on Day 134, the signs and symptoms resumed. On Day 224, the subject experienced another event of herpes zoster. The initial event of herpes zoster was assessed as moderate in intensity and related to study medication.

The subject continued to experience severe nausea, vomiting, dehydration and headache and presented to the ER on the following 2 days. On the third day when the subject returned to the ER, he was admitted for observation, IV fluids, antiemetic and pain medication. The subject denied fever, chills, sore throat, weakness, numbness or tingling. Assessments included a normal white cell count, normal liver function tests (except for a slightly elevated bilirubin), and negative head CT. The adverse event resolved on the fourth day and the subject was discharged with the diagnosis of gastroenteritis. The adverse event was assessed as severe and not likely to be related to the study product.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment Emergent Adverse Events and Adverse Reactions</head><p>In the placebo controlled safety pool (Week 0-16 of Trial P003, Week 0-12 of Trials P010 and P011), treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) occurred in 48.2% of subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 mg, 47.9% of subjects treated with tildrakizumab 200 mg, and 53.5% of subjects in the placebo group. The most common TEAE were in the system/organ class (SOC) of infections and infestations and included upper respiratory infections (URI) and gastroenteritis. For Trial P003, only safety data from subjects treated with tildrakizumab100 mg or 200 mg are included here. Because AEs of URI, injection site reactions (ISR), and abdominal pain were reported under multiple preferred terms, we pooled these AEs to better evaluate their overall frequency of occurrence (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 39</ref> below).</p><p>The AE category of upper respiratory infections (URI) is comprised of pooled preferred terms nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, viral upper respiratory tract infection, and pharyngitis. The URIs were the most commonly reported AE, occurring in &gt;10% frequency in all treatment groups. Although URIs are common illnesses, the difference in frequency of URIs between subjects treated with tildrakizumab and placebo was greater than 1%. URI occurred in 13.9% of subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 mg, 12.7% of subjects treated with tildrakizumab 200 mg, and 11.5% of subjects in the placebo group.</p><p>The AE category of injection Site Reactions (ISR) is comprised of the following pooled preferred terms: injection site urticaria, pruritus, pain, reaction, erythema, inflammation, edema, swelling, bruising, hematoma, and hemorrhage. A total of 93 events of ISR were reported by 53/1413 (3.8%) subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 or 200 mg and 8/357 (2.2%) of subjects treated with placebo. The breakdown of AE by dose is as follows. A total of 24/705 (3.4%) subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 mg reported 44 AE, and 29/708 (4.1%) subjects treated with tildrakizumab 200 mg reported 49 AE of ISR. For subjects treated with tildrakizumab, subject race was White in 51/53 (96.2%), Asian in 1/53 (1.9%), and missing in 1/53 (1.9%); 35/53 (66.0%) subjects were male and 18/53 (34.0%) were female. Although the mean duration of ISR was 9.3 days (range 1-605 days), the duration was 2 days or fewer in 69/93 (74.2%) events. The reported severity of ISR was mild in 88/93 (94.6%) and moderate in 5/93 (5.4%) of events. Investigators considered the relationship of ISR to treatment to be related in 76/93 (81.7%) and not related in 17/93 (18.3%) events. No abnormal laboratory studies or vital signs correlated temporally with ISR. All ISR events resolved. None of the ISR events resulted in interruption or discontinuation of treatment.</p><p>A total of 24 AE of fatigue were reported by 24/1413 (1.7%) subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 or 200 mg and 6/357 (1.7%) of subjects treated with placebo. The breakdown of AE by dose is as follows. A total of 17/705 (2.4%) subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 mg reported 17 AE, and 7/708 (1.0%) subjects treated with tildrakizumab 200 mg reported 7 AE of fatigue. For subjects treated with tildrakizumab, subject race was White in 24/24 (100%); 12/24 (50%) subjects were male and 12/24 (50%) were female. Although the mean duration of resolved fatigue events was 77.4 days (range 1-614 days), the duration of fatigue was 8 days or fewer in 10/22 (45.5%) events. The reported severity of fatigue was mild in 20/24 (83.3%) and moderate in 4/24 (16.7%) of events. The relationship of fatigue to treatment was judged by investigators to be not related in 12/24 (50%) and related in 12/24 (50%) events. Associated conditions reported as AE included nasopharyngitis in 3/24 (12.5%). One subject (a 48-year-old male, Subject #3222-010_011600003) had sinus bradycardia from Screening through the end of the study, and reported AE of fatigue from Day 43 until the end of the study. No abnormalities in laboratory studies or vital signs occurred concomitantly with AE of fatigue. Another subject (a 40-year-old female, Subject #3222-011_492300006) reported fatigue with concomitant "pressure" in her back, chest, and throat of Day 1 of the study. A total of 22/24 (91.7%) of the fatigue events resolved; 2/24 (9.3%) were not resolved. None of the fatigue events resulted in interruption or discontinuation of treatment. Although the difference in frequency of fatigue between subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 mg and placebo is small, investigators judged half of the AE of fatigue to be related to treatment with tildrakizumab. Therefore, we recommend fatigue to be included as an Adverse Reaction (AR) in product labeling.</p><p>A total of 30 AE of diarrhea were reported by 23/1413 (1.6%) subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 or 200 mg and 5/357 (1.4%) of subjects treated with placebo. The breakdown of AE by dose is as follows. A total of 13/705 (1.8%) subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 mg reported 16 AE, and 10/708 (1.2%) subjects treated with tildrakizumab 200 mg reported 14 AE of diarrhea. For subjects treated with tildrakizumab, subject race was White in 23/23 (100%); 16/23 (69.6%) subjects were male and 7/23 (30.4%) were female. Although the mean duration was 26.2 days (range 1-523 days), the duration of diarrhea was 6 days or fewer in 22/30 (73.3%) events. The reported severity of diarrhea was mild in 21/30 (70%) and moderate in 9/30 (30%) events. Investigators considered the relationship of diarrhea to treatment to be related in 16/30 (53.3%) and not related in 14/30 (46.7%) events. Associated conditions reported as AE included upper abdominal pain with 2/30 (6.7%) events; abdominal pain with dyspepsia and gastroesophageal reflux disease with 1/30 (3.3%) events, and tonsillitis, fever, nausea, nasopharyngitis, chills, vomiting, and headache each occurring with 1/30 (3.3%) events of diarrhea. Laboratory studies were normal in 17/23 (73.9%) subjects; 6/23 (26.1%) subjects had elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT) or bilirubin. The liver enzyme/bilirubin elevations also occurred at other timepoints in the trial which did not correlate temporally with AE of diarrhea. Additionally, the presence or absence of fever was not recorded for any subject with diarrhea. All the diarrhea events resolved. None of the diarrhea events resulted in interruption or discontinuation of treatment. Although the difference in frequency of diarrhea between subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 mg and placebo is small, investigators judged over half of the AE of diarrhea to be related to treatment with tildrakizumab. Diarrhea of severe intensity was also reported as an AE in the tildrakizumab 200 mg dose group in Phase 1 Study P06306. Furthermore, the applicant included diarrhea as an AR in their proposed labeling. Therefore, we recommend diarrhea to be included as an Adverse Reaction (AR) in product labeling.</p><p>A total of 23 AE of back pain were reported by 21/1413 (1.5%) subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 or 200 mg and 4/357 (1.1%) of subjects treated with placebo. The breakdown of AE by dose is as follows. A total of 9/705 (1.3%) subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 mg reported 10 AE of back pain, and 12/708 (1.7%) subjects treated with tildrakizumab 200 mg reported 13 AE of back pain. For subjects treated with tildrakizumab, subject race was White in 19/21 (90.5%), and Asian in 2/21 (9.5%); 16/21 (76.2%) subjects were male and 5/21 (23.8%) were female. The mean duration of back pain AE was 22.3 days (range 1-104 days). The mean duration of back pain AE was longer for subjects treated with tildrakizumab 200 mg (37.2 days, range 1-104 days) than for subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 mg (15.9 days, range 2-59 days). The reported severity of back pain was mild in 13/23 (56.5%) and moderate in 10/23 (43.5%) of events. Investigators considered the relationship of back pain to treatment to be not related in 22/23 (95.7%) and related in 1/23 (4.3%) event. Associated conditions reported as AE included 1/21 (4.8%) subject with abdominal pain and hematuria, 1 with pyrexia, 1 with arthralgia, and 1 with headache. A total of 22/23 (95.7%) of the back pain events resolved; 1/23 (5.9%) was resolved with sequelae. None of the back pain events resulted in interruption or discontinuation of treatment. Although the difference in frequency of back pain between subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 mg and placebo is small, both the frequency of subjects reporting AE and the exposure-adjusted AE of back pain were greater in subjects treated with tildrakizumab 200 mg. This indicates that the AE of back pain was dose-dependent. In addition, the mean duration of back pain was longer in subjects treated with tildrakizumab 200 mg.</p><p>Therefore, we recommend back pain to be included as an Adverse Reaction (AR) in product labeling.</p><p>The AE category of abdominal pain is comprised of the following pooled preferred terms: abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain upper, and abdominal pain lower. A total of 17 events of abdominal pain were reported by 16/1413 (1.1%) subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 or 200 mg and 2/357 (0.6%) of subjects treated with placebo. The breakdown of AE by dose is as follows. A total of 9/705 (1.3%) subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 mg reported 9 AE, and 7/708 (1.0%) subjects treated with tildrakizumab 200 mg reported 8 AE of abdominal pain. For subjects treated with tildrakizumab, subject race was White in 13/16 (81.3%), Asian in 1/16 (6.3%), Hawaiian/Pacific Islander in 1/16 (6.3%), and multiracial in 1/16 (6.3%); 7/16 (43.8%) subjects were male and 9/16 (56.2%) were female. No past medical history of gastrointestinal (GI) disease was present in 12/16 (75%), while 4/16 (25%) subjects reported a history of GI disease. Of the 4 subjects with a history of GI disease, one had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, one had "inflammatory bowel syndrome" (coded by investigators under preferred term inflammatory bowel disease), one had hemorrhoids, and one had dyspepsia, constipation, and rectal bleeding. Although the mean duration was 13 days (range 1-83 days), the duration of abdominal pain was 6 days or fewer in 11/17 (64.7%) subjects. The reported severity of abdominal pain was mild in 15/17 (88.2%) and moderate in 2/17 (11.8%) of events. Investigators considered the relationship of abdominal pain to treatment to be not related in 10/17 (58.8%) and related in 7/17 (41.2%) events. Associated conditions reported as AE occurring concomitantly with abdominal pain included diarrhea with 3/17 (17.6%) events, decreased appetite and nasopharyngitis, each with 2/17 (11.8%) events; back pain and hematuria, vomiting, sinusitis and oropharyngeal pain, and nausea each with 1/17 (5.9%) events. No abnormal laboratory studies or vital signs correlated temporally with AE of abdominal pain. A total of 16/17 (94.1%) abdominal pain events resolved, and 1/17 (5.9%) Reference ID: 4233639</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">(b) (4) (b) (4)</formula><p>was not resolved. None of the abdominal pain events resulted in interruption or discontinuation of treatment. Although the difference in frequency of abdominal pain between subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 mg and placebo is small, investigators judged almost half of the AE of abdominal pain to be related to treatment with tildrakizumab. Furthermore, abdominal pain was reported as an AE in 13% of subjects treated with tildrakizumab in Phase 1 Study P05839, and abdominal pain was reported as an adverse reaction in Phase 1 Study P06306. Therefore, we recommend abdominal pain to be included as an Adverse Reaction (AR) in product labeling.</p><p>A total of 21 AE of gastroenteritis (from the SOC of Infections and Infestations) were reported by 21/1413 (1.5%) subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 or 200 mg and 4/357 (1.1%) of subjects treated with placebo. The breakdown of AE by dose is as follows. A total of 8/705 (1.1%) subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 mg reported 8 AE, and 13/708 (1.8%) subjects treated with tildrakizumab 200 mg reported 13 AE of gastroenteritis. For subjects treated with tildrakizumab, subject race was White in 18/21 (85.7%), Asian in 2/21 (9.5%), and multiracial in 1/21 (4.8%); 14/21 (66.7%) subjects were male and 7/21 (33.3%) were female. No past medical history of gastrointestinal (GI) disease was present in 14/21 (66.7%), while 7/21 (33.3%) subjects reported a history of GI disease. Of the 7 subjects with a history of GI disease, four had a history remarkable only for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), one had a history of hemorrhoids, one had a history of constipation, and one had a history of GERD, Crohn's disease, and nausea. Although the mean duration was 5.1 days (range 1-21 days), the duration of gastroenteritis was 3 days or fewer in 10/21 (47.6%) subjects. The reported severity of gastroenteritis was mild in 9/21 (42.9%) and moderate in 12/21 (57.1%) of subjects. Investigators considered the relationship of gastroenteritis to treatment to be not related in 19/21 (90.5%) and related in 2/21 (9.5%). Associated conditions reported as AE occurring concomitantly with gastroenteritis include 1/21 (4.8%) subject with anxiety, 1/21 (4.8%) subject with nasopharyngitis, and 1/21 (4.8%) subject with AE of headache, vomiting, herpes zoster, and sunburn. Laboratory studies were normal in 20/21 (95.2%) subjects; 1/21 (4.8%) subject had elevated GGT. The GGT elevation was less than twice the upper limit of normal, and also occurred at other timepoints in the trial which did not correlate temporally with AE of gastroenteritis. Additionally, the presence or absence of fever was not recorded for any subject with gastroenteritis. All the gastroenteritis events resolved. None of the gastroenteritis events resulted in interruption or discontinuation of treatment. Because the 200 mg dose of tildrakizumab will not be included in product labeling, and the frequency of gastroenteritis was the same in the tildrakizumab 100 mg and the placebo groups, gastroenteritis will not be included as an AR in product labeling.</p><p>A total of 19 AE of nausea were reported by 18/1413 (1.3%) subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 or 200 mg and 3/357 (0.8%) of subjects treated with placebo. The breakdown of AE by dose is as follows. A total of 7/705 (1.0%) subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 mg reported 7 AE, and 11/708 (1.6%) subjects treated with tildrakizumab 200 mg reported 12 AE of nausea. For subjects treated with tildrakizumab, subject race was White in 16/18 (88.9%), Asian in 1/18 (5.6%), and mixed race in 1/18 (5.6%); 9/18 (50%) subjects were male and 9/18 (50%) were female. Although the mean duration of resolved nausea events was 11.3 days (range 1-170 days), the duration of nausea was 3 days or fewer in 16/19 (84.2%) events. The reported severity of nausea was mild in 17/19 (89.5%) and moderate in 2/19 (10.5%) of events. Investigators considered the relationship of nausea to treatment to be not related in 13/19 (68.4%) and related in 6/19 (31.6%) events. Associated conditions reported as AE included dizziness in 4/18 (22.2%, including one subject who sustained a concussion and fracture of the nose), headache in 2/18 (11.1%), and abdominal pain, renal colic, vomiting, fatigue, rash, and dry mouth; each occurring in 1/18 (5.6%) subject. Laboratory studies were normal in 12/18 (66.7%) subjects; 6/18 (33.3%) subjects had elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT) or BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation -BLA 761067 ILUMYA (tildrakizumab) injection, for subcutaneous use 128 bilirubin. The liver enzyme/bilirubin elevations also occurred at other timepoints in the trial which did not correlate temporally with AE of nausea. Additionally, the presence or absence of fever was not recorded for any subject with nausea. A total of 18/19 (94.7%) of the nausea events resolved, and 1/19 (5.3%) was not resolved. None of the nausea events resulted in interruption or discontinuation of treatment. Although the difference in frequency of nausea between subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 mg and placebo is small, both the frequency of subjects reporting AE and the exposure-adjusted AE of nausea were greater in subjects treated with tildrakizumab 200 mg. This indicates that the AE of nausea was dose-dependent. In addition, in Phase 1 Study P05839, nausea was reported as an AE in 8% of subjects treated with tildrakizumab; nausea was reported as an AR also.</p><p>. Therefore, we recommend nausea to be included as an Adverse Reaction (AR) in product labeling.</p><p>To evaluate the potential relationship between treatment with tildrakizumab and common gastrointestinal AE, we pooled AE of gastroenteritis (GE) with AE of symptoms commonly associated with GE (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea). These are displayed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 38</ref> below. After pooling, the frequency of GE related events was corrected for duplicates (i.e. subjects reporting two different GE related AE [e.g. vomiting and diarrhea] were only counted once). No subject reported more than two different GE related AE during the Placebocontrolled period. A total of 36/705 (5.1%) of subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 mg and 41/708 (5.8%) of subjects treated with tildrakizumab 200 mg reported GE related TEAE, compared to 14/357 (3.9%) of subjects in the placebo group. It should be noted that approximately 13% of subjects who received tildrakizumab (100/200 mg) reported more than one GE related AE; in contrast, no subjects in the placebo group reported more than one GE related AE during the Placebo-controlled period. It should also be noted that in cryosections of normal human tissues, tildraklizumab staining was observed in cytoplasm and/or cytoplasmic granules of intrinsic and/or vascular smooth muscle in colon, stomach, liver, and pancreas; and of epithelium of esophagus (glands, submucosa), small intestine (mucosa), stomach (mucosa, mucus neck cells), pancreas (acini), and salivary glands (acini). (Tildrakizumab staining of human tissue is discussed in more detail in Section 5.5.5 of this review.) These data further support inclusion of these events in the Adverse Reactions section of product labeling. A total of 17 AE of dizziness were reported by 15/1413 (1.1%) subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 or 200 mg and 0/357 of subjects treated with placebo. The breakdown of AE by dose is as follows. A total of 5/705 (0.7%) subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 mg reported 5 AE, and 10/708 (1.4%) subjects treated with tildrakizumab 200 mg reported 12 AE of dizziness. For subjects treated with tildrakizumab, subject race was White in 9/15 (60%), African American in 2/15 (13.3%), Asian in 1/15 (6.7%), and mixed race in 1/15 (6.7%); 10/15 (66.7%) subjects were male and 5/15 (33.3%) were female. Although the mean duration of resolved dizziness events was 9.9 days (range 1-57 days), the duration of dizziness was 3 days or fewer in 12/17 (70.6%) events. The reported severity of dizziness was mild in 15/17 (88.2%) and moderate in 2/17 (11.8%) of events. Investigators considered the relationship of dizziness to treatment to be not related in 13/17 (76.5%) and related in 4/17 (23.5%) events. Associated conditions reported as AE included nausea in 3/15 (20%, including one subject who sustained a concussion and fracture of the nose), and fatigue, tinnitus, and diarrhea; each occurring in 1/18 (5.6%) subjects. No abnormalities in laboratory studies or vital signs occurred concomitantly with AE of dizziness. A total of 16/17 (94.1%) of the dizziness events resolved; 1/17 (5.9%) was not resolved. None of the dizziness events resulted in interruption or discontinuation of treatment.</p><p>Through the Base Period (Week 52 of Trials P003 and P011, and Week 64 of Trial P010), no new adverse reactions were identified with tildrakizumab use and the frequency of the adverse reactions was similar to that observed during the placebo-controlled period.</p><p>After review of the safety database, we identified the TEAE occurring in greater than 1% of subjects treated with tildrakizumab and more frequently than in the placebo group during the placebo controlled safety period in Trials P003, P010 and P011. AE of injection site reactions, back pain, gastroenteritis, nausea, and dizziness occurred more frequently in subjects treated with tildrakizumab 200 mg than tildrakizumab 100 mg. <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 39</ref> displays the TEAE, along with the terms pooled for each AE, where applicable.</p><p>Data regarding the tildrakizumab 200 mg dose (refer to Section 6.3.2.2 of this review) and etanercept (refer to Section 7.2.5 of this review) will not be included in approved product labeling. <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">Table 40</ref> displays adverse reactions recommended to be included in section 6 of product labeling.  We compared exposure-adjusted abnormal laboratory values reported as adverse events during the Placebo-controlled Period and the Base Period.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electrocardiograms (ECGs)</head><p>The applicant summarized changes from baseline in electrocardiogram (ECG) findings for the Phase 2/3 Base Period Safety Pool. Due to re-randomizations in different parts of the trial, these summaries were restricted to the 4 continuous exposure arms. Because the 3 trials had different visit schedules, for the purpose of comparison of results across time, only the trial visits common across the Phase 2 and 3 trials were summarized. Common time points for measurement of ECG parameters were Week 0, 4, 12, 28, and 52 (Trial P003 and P011) or 64 (P010). In Trial P003, P010, and P011, the applicant reported that no clinically relevant changes from baseline in ECG parameters.</p><p>The evaluation of safety included ECGs in Phase 1 Trials P05382 in subjects with psoriasis; and trials P05661, P05776, and P06306 in healthy subjects. An integrated analysis of ECG data from these Phase 1 trials revealed no evidence of QTc prolongation.</p><p>Per the consult review by Dr. Christine Garnett, the QT Interdisciplinary Review Team (QT-IRT) concluded that, "Based on analysis of the ISS data sets tildrakizumab does not appear to prolong QTc, PR or QRS."</p><p>Evaluation of the effect of tildrakizumab on the QT interval will be discussed in the next subsection of this review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>QT</head><p>The ICH E14 guideline regarding the clinical evaluation of QT/QTc interval prolongation and proarrhythmic potential for nonantiarrhythmic drugs does not specifically address QT assessments for biologic agents. Recent publications, however, indicate a consensus that, because of their large size and high target specificity, mAbs such as tildrakizumab have a very low likelihood for ion channel interactions and therefore thorough QT/QTc studies are not generally needed.</p><p>Although a thorough QT study was not performed for tildrakizumab, the applicant nonetheless explored a relationship between tildrakizumab concentrations and QTc during the development program. The QT Interdisciplinary Review Team (QT-IRT) reviewed data including pre-and posttreatment ECG parameters submitted by the applicant and a revised ECG outlier analysis. Per the QT-IRT consult review by Dr. Christine Garnett, "Based on analysis of the ISS data sets tildrakizumab does not appear to prolong QTc, PR or QRS."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunogenicity</head><p>Because therapeutic proteins have the potential to elicit an immune response, the applicant used validated assays to assess the immunogenicity of tildrakizumab in human serum in 8 trials in the development program (P05661, P05776, P06306, P05382, P009, P010, P011, P05495</p><p>[P003]). Because the applicant used different assays for the immunogenicity assessment in different phases of the development program, the analysis of the impact of antibody production on safety was conducted with data from pooled Phase 3 trials only.</p><p>After up to 64 weeks of treatment, the incidence of treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (TE-ADA) to tildrakizumab in the pooled Phase 3 trials P010 and P011 was 6.8% (25/369) for subjects receiving 100 mg and 8.8% (29/329) for subjects receiving 200 mg of tildrakizumab. Among the subjects with TE-ADA, the incidence of neutralizing antibodies was 40.0% (10/25) for subjects receiving 100 mg and 37.9% (11/29) for subjects receiving 200 mg. Although the numbers of subjects with TE-POS NAb-POS was limited (21 subjects), some adverse events were observed with greater frequency in the TE-POS NAb-POS group (increased injection site reactions and hypersensitivity reactions). Refer to the assessment of immunogenicity by Dr. Jie Wang in Section 6.2.1.4 and the Pharmacology Appendix of this review for a discussion of the immunogenicity findings and incidence rates.</p><p>The following information from the Phase 3 trials is recommended to be included in Section 6.2 of labeling regarding 100 mg dose of tildrakizumab:</p><p>"Up to Week 64, approximately 6 % of subjects treated with ILUMYA developed antibodies to tildrakizumab. Of the subjects who developed antibodies to tildrakizumab, approximately 40% had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies to tildrakizumab were associated with reduced drug concentrations and reduced efficacy. Subjects who developed antibodies to tildrakizumab were more likely to experience hypersensitivity or injection-site reaction compared to subjects who were antibody negative."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rebound</head><p>The applicant evaluated rebound of psoriasis during Part 3 of Trial 010 following withdrawal of tildrakizumab treatment among re-randomized tildrakizumab responders. Rebound of disease was defined as worsening of psoriasis over Baseline PASI score (PASI &gt;125%), or new pustular, erythrodermic, or more inflammatory psoriasis occurring within 2 months of stopping therapy. No subjects in either treatment group (100 mg placebo or 200 mg placebo), experienced rebound of disease during Part 3 (Weeks 32 to 64).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Submission-Specific Safety Issues</head><p>The applicant analyzed the safety parameters using a tiered approach with pre-specified analyses associated with each tier. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Tier 1 adverse events (AEs) represented "adverse events of special interest" which were related to the proposed tildrakizumab mechanism of action (immunomodulation via cytokine blockade), class effects associated with other anti-cytokine antibody therapies and the specific risks and co-morbidities observed in the target population.</p><p>Adverse events identified as Tier 1 were as follows:</p><p>Serious infections (defined as any infection meeting the regulatory definition of an SAE, or any infection requiring IV antibiotics regardless of whether it was reported as an SAE, as per the regulatory definition) Malignancies (excluding carcinoma in situ of the cervix) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Severe Infections</head><p>During the Placebo-controlled period, the incidence of severe infections was the same in the tildrakizumab 200 mg group and the placebo group (0.3/100 subject-years) and was less in the tildrakizumab 100 mg group (0.1/100 subject-years). During the base period, there were more severe infections among subjects receiving tildrakizumab 200 mg (14 subjects or 1.61/100 subject-years) than receiving tildrakizumab 100 mg (11 subjects or 1.10/100 subject-years) or placebo (2 subjects or 0.91/100 subject-years). However, among subjects with continuous exposure to tildrakizumab 100 mg or 200 mg, the incidence of severe infections was comparable (0.8 subject years). Severe infections reported during the Base period by more than 1 subject included appendicitis, cellulitis, diverticulitis, epiglottitis, gastroenteritis, herpes zoster, sinusitis, and wound infection. Other severe infections reported by a single subject include tuberculosis, erysipelas, pneumonia, sepsis, septic shock, pyelonephritis, soft tissue infection, and urosepsis. There was a higher percentage of subjects with infections/infestations among partial responders in Part 3 who started with 100 mg and received 200 mg compared to those who continued to receive 100 mg. In the Extension period, the incidence of severe infections was comparable (1.3%) among subjects receiving tildrakizumab 100 mg and 200 mg.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selected Narratives of Drug-Related Infections</head><p>Tildrakizumab 200 mg A 53-year-old Asian male with a medical history of tobacco usage (40 pack years) who received tildrakizumab 200 mg experienced a drug-related adverse event of epiglottitis. On Day 1, the subject was randomized to tildrakizumab 200 mg. Approximately 49 days after the last dose of tildrakizumab (Day 79), he was diagnosed with epiglottitis and hospitalized. After treatment with antibiotics and dexamethasone, the swelling improved. The subject was withdrawn from the trial. The event resolved on Day 323.</p><p>Two subjects (41-year-old White male and 63-year-old black male) with a history of smoking who received tildrakizumab 200 mg experienced drug-related adverse events of cellulitis. Both subjects received the diagnosis of cellulitis (sacrum and right face, respectively) on approximately Day 450 and were hospitalized. The events resolved with antibiotics and both subjects continued tildrakizumab and completed the base period.</p><p>A 74-year-old White female ) with a history of diabetes who received tildrakizumab 200 mg had a serious, drug-related adverse event of herpes zoster, which led to discontinuation from the trial. On Day 107 the subject was hospitalized with erythema, blistering, pain and pruritus localized to area innervated by the right trigeminus nerve (V1 and V2). Her last dose of tildrakizumab was on Day 28. She improved after treatment with acyclovir and gabapentin and was discharged from the hospital on Day 118. On Day 134, the signs and symptoms of herpes zoster recurred.</p><p>A 58-year-old White male with a history of obesity and tobacco usage (28 pack years) who was receiving tildrakizumab 200 mg, experienced a severe, drug-related event of wound infection. On Day 76, the subject experienced infection of incised wound on his left thenar eminence and was hospitalized for hand surgery. The subject was treated with clindamycin and was discharged from the hospital on Day 83. On day 96, the subject resumed the study medication. </p></div>

Prior to randomization, the subject was evaluated for chronic cough with a transbronchial needle biopsy of the left upper lobe. Results showed non-necrotizing granulomas that were negative for fungal organisms and acid fast bacilli. A Mantoux tuberculin skin test conducted at screening was negative. On an unknown date the subject experienced worsening back pain. The evaluation included a bone biopsy which was positive for acid fast bacilli at T8. The subject was diagnosed with active tuberculosis of the spine on Day 178. On Day 191, a CT scan showed a left upper lobe mass and multiple destructive lesions in the right scapula, bilateral ribs, and the vertebral bodies. His last dose of tildrakizumab prior to the AE was on Day 118.The only risk factor that was reported by the subject was occasional travel to Asia for business. The subject completed his last study visit on Day 156 and was discontinued from the trial on Day 202. On Day 570 the event was considered resolved after treatment with ethambutol, isoniazid, rifampin, pyridoxine, pyrazinamide, and moxifloxacin. The event was assessed as related to tildrakizumab.</p><p>Ten events of herpes zoster occurred in the Base period and 5 events in the extension period with exposure to tildrakizumab doses ranging from 25 mg to 200 mg (total doses of 150-1600 mg of tildrakizumab) or etanercept (2 subjects). There was no clear evidence of a dose response. The mean age of subjects who developed herpes zoster was 53 years (range 25-74 years). Most AEs were moderate in severity, occurred late in the course of treatment and resolved without sequelae. Age was the only risk factor identified in most subjects. A 74-yearold female was hospitalized for herpes zoster and withdrawn from the trial. For the remainder of the subjects who developed herpes zoster, the AE did not result in a change in the dose of the study drug or discontinuation from the trial.</p><p>There were no reports of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or a significant imbalance in candidal or herpes simplex infections.</p><p>The following language is recommended to be included in Section 5.3 of product labeling: "In clinical trials, of 55 subjects with latent TB who were concurrently treated with ILUMYA and appropriate TB prophylaxis, no subjects developed active TB (during the mean followup of 56.5 weeks)."</p></div>

One subject had a history of hyperlipidemia ; the other subject had no relevant risk factors but assessment of causality was confounded by previous use of cyclosporine and apremilast for the treatment of plaque psoriasis. Per applicant, the other malignancies which were assessed as related to tildrakizumab were transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder in a 74-year-old White male with a history of prostatic hypertrophy and previous use of cyclosporine, methotrexate and monoethyl/diethyl fumarate for the treatment of plaque psoriasis (after 4 doses of tildrakizumab 100 mg) and thyroid cancer in a 35-year-old White female with a history of nodular goiter receiving methimazole which was an incidental finding after surgical removal of the thyroid gland (after 6 doses of tildrakizumab 100 mg).</p><p>The only solid tumor reported by more than one subject (aged 39 years and 50 years) in the etanercept group was breast cancer. The events were assessed as moderate or severe and related to the study product. However, the younger subject had an undisclosed history of breast cancer and was withdrawn from the trial. This subject also received 1 dose of tildrakizumab 200 mg. The event was assessed as unlikely to be related to tildrakizumab. The second subject had no risk factors for breast cancer (no long-term use of hormone replacement therapy and no personal or family history of breast cancer). Assessment of causality was confounded by previous use of monoethyl/diethyl fumarate and an investigational janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of plaque psoriasis.</p><p>There were 3 subjects who received tildrakizumab 100 mg and developed malignant melanoma. A 28 year-old male without documented risk factors developed malignant melanoma on Day 135 after 3 doses of tildrakizumab 100 mg. The subject was withdrawn from the trial. The event was assessed as severe (lymph nodes positive for melanoma) and related to the study product. A 56 year-old male with a history of a dysplastic nevus developed a malignant melanoma in situ within a dysplastic nevus on Day 343 after 5 doses of tildrakizumab 100 mg. The event of melanoma did not result in interruption or discontinuation of treatment. The event was assessed as moderate and not related. In addition, a 24 year-old male with a history of many nevi and use of tanning beds experienced 2 events of malignant melanoma in situ (Day 197 and Day 208) after 2 doses of 100 mg and 1 dose of 25 mg of tildrakizumab. The subject was withdrawn from the trial. The events were assessed as moderate and not related to the study product.</p><p>During the Base period, 15 subjects who received one of the proposed doses of tildrakizumab (9 subjects receiving 100 mg and 6 subjects receiving 200 mg) developed basal cell carcinomas (BCCs).

The reported severity of basal cell carcinoma was mild in 4 subjects, moderate in 9 subjects and severe in 2 subjects. The majority were White males ranging in age from 50 to 72 years old. Four of 13 subjects (31%) had a history of BCC or actinic keratosis (AK) or a family history of skin cancer. Two subjects (15%) had a document history of using photosensitizing medications (acitretin and furosemide) and no subjects had a documented history of phototherapy. Four subjects (31%) developed BCCs and squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) during treatment with tildrakizumab 100 mg. Two subjects (15%) who developed BCCs received etanercept for 28 weeks and then tildrakizumab 200 mg.

During the base period of the pooled safety analysis set (P003, P010, P011), there was 1 suicide attempt and 2 events of suicidal ideation in one subject during a single hospitalization. During the extension Phase, there were 2 completed suicides and 1 event of suicidal ideation. In addition, there was one suicide attempt during the Phase 1 Trial P007. These events are briefly summarized below.</p><p>A 43-year-old Asian male subject enrolled in Trial P010 with a history of schizophrenia which was treated with anti-psychotic medications and benzodiazepines attempted suicide by cutting his abdominal wall on Day 12 after 1 dose of tildrakizumab 200 mg.</p><p>A 35-year-old multi-racial female with history of a suicide attempt, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, and insomnia reported suicidal ideation while hospitalized for management for worsening depression and bipolar disorder on Day 278 after 4 doses of 100 mg tildrakizumab. Her psychotropic medications had been interrupted for a span of 2 months prior to the event.</p><p>A 45-year-old White male with history of facial nerve pain and concomitant treatment with pregabalin and methylphenidate (MPH) and mixed amphetamine salts died on Day 1306 by jumping off a roof after receiving tildrakizumab 200 mg in the base period (6 doses) and tildrakizumab 100 mg (10 doses) in the extension period.

He had no history of depression or suicidal ideation but experienced significant financial and psychosocial stressors related to unemployment and compulsive gambling.) The subject was discontinued from the trial.</p><p>In addition, there were deaths which were difficult to define as SIB events due to insufficient information. The cause of death for one subject with a history of depression and suicidal ideation was reported as a toxic reaction between fluoxetine and cyclobenzaprine. There were 2 other deaths related to alcohol abuse. Refer to Section 7.3.4 of this review for brief narratives.</p><p>Jean Kim MD, MA, Division of Psychiatry Products (DPP), provided WHO based causality assessments of the SIB events and suspicious deaths summarized above (Review dated 10/19/2017). She concluded that only the suicide attempt by Subject was possibly related to tildrakizumab due to the temporal association with drug administration.</p><p>The blinded, external Clinical Adjudication Committee (CAC) at Columbia University reviewed data which was submitted with the original BLA from the 9 trials in the tildrakizumab clinical development program (Safety Update Report dated 10/2/2017; SD 18). The CAC identified 3 cases in the base period of the Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials: 1 suicide attempt and 2 events of suicidal ideation in one subject during a single hospitalization. The exposure adjusted rates for tildrakizumab in the base period were compared with results of the DEPI-I analysis 28 of pooled Phase 2/3 data for biologics (excluding brodalumab), the exposure-adjusted rates were 0 vs. 14.5 per 100,000 PY for completed suicides; 28.5 vs. 50.7 per 100,000 PY for suicide attempts; and 28.5 vs. 25.4 per 100,000 PY for ideation. The CAC concluded that "the results are considered generally comparable with the low rates observed in the development programs for other biologics." There were 3 additional SIB events after the C-CASA analysis period (2 completed suicides and 1 suicidal ideation). All three events were assessed as unrelated to tildrakizumab by the adjudication committee and did not change the safety conclusion.</p><p>Dr. Kim stated that the rates of psychiatric AEs were low in the tildrakizumab treatment groups in the Phase 2 and 3 trials. The crude rates for the placebo controlled period were: 1.6% (tildrakizumab 100 mg), 2.3% (tildrakizumab 200 mg) and 0.84% (placebo). She indicated that these differences were not nominally statistically significant. The 2 completed suicides which occurred during the extension trials (Safety Update Report dated 10/2/2017; SD 18) occurred in the context of pre-existing psychiatric disease and were not likely to be related to tildrakizumab. In addition, adverse events of depression, anxiety and insomnia, the most common psychotic adverse events, were not likely to be related to tildrakizumab.</p><p>Dr. Kim did not recommend specific psychiatric warning language in the tildrakizumab labeling. Dr. Kim concluded that "there is insufficient evidence of increased risk of SI/B or other psychiatric issues thus far with tildrakizumab, in terms of direct drug-related effect, based on the current clinical trial data available. There is also no preliminary research thus far showing any clear association with IL-23 and psychiatric sequelae." See review by Dr. Kim dated 10/19/2017.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Analyses by Demographic Subgroups</head><p>The review team conducted multiple analyses to evaluate the safety profile of tildrakizumab in different populations. The results indicated that there were no substantial differences in the risk of adverse reactions in demographic subgroups. However, because the trials were not powered for these analyses, the data must be interpreted with caution. A slightly greater proportion of females who received tildrakizumab reported adverse reactions of injection site reaction, fatigue, abdominal pain, diarrhea and nausea than males. Approximately 90% of subjects enrolled in the pooled Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials were adults 64 years of age; therefore, because of the limited number of subjects age &gt;65 years, it would be difficult to detect any differences in safety compared with younger subjects. The data for safety by race is difficult to interpret due to the relatively small sample sizes of the non-White subgroups (White; 80%; Asian 14%;others races 3% each). The safety findings across the weight subgroups ( 90 kg and &gt; 90 kg) were similar although a greater percentage of subjects in the &gt;90 kg subgroup who received tildrakizumab experienced injection site reactions. Refer to Appendix 13.3 for the results of the safety analyses by demographic subgroup.</p></div>

The most frequent AEs in the trial were headache, upper respiratory tract infection and injection site hematoma reported by 14 (24%), 11 (19%) and 9 (15%) subjects respectively. There was no clear relationship between dose and incidence or severity of AE's. ARs were reported by 24 (41%) subjects in the study: 10 (53%) Caucasian subjects, 5 (42%) Chinese subjects and 9 (41%) Japanese (Part 1) subjects. The most common ARs in the trial were injection site hematoma, injection site pain and injection site erythema reported by 9 (15%), 6 (10%) and 5 (8%) subjects respectively. Most AEs were mild in intensity. Nineteen (32%) subjects reported adverse events of moderate intensity. Three of the 19 AEs were assessed as possibly related to treatment: abdominal pain (Japanese subject: 50 mg dose group), disturbance in attention and lethargy (Caucasian subject: 200 mg dose group), Three (16%) Caucasian subjects reported AEs of severe intensity: diarrhea, vomiting and headache (200 mg dose group), depression (50 mg dose group), appendicitis (50 mg dose group).After a single dose 400mg, one 24-year-old subject withdrew from the trial and was hospitalized due to suicidal ideation on Day 63 due to gambling debts and unemployment. There were no other adverse events of special interest. This was a randomized, fixed-sequence, 2-period, parallel group, multi-center, open-label, multiple-dose trial of SC tildrakizumab 100 mg administered via prefilled syringe (PFS) vs PFS housed in an autoinjector in 20 subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis age 18-65 years. This trial evaluated the effect of tildrakizumab on CYP metabolism (CYP probe substrates: caffeine, warfarin, vitamin K, omeprazole, dextromethorphan, and midazolam), the PK and relative bioavailability of tildrakizumab when administered via the PFS compared with PFS in an AI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Results</head><p>There were no deaths; 1 subject experienced an SAE resulting in discontinuation from the trial on Day 56 (infected dermal cyst assessed as related to tildrakizumab). The SAE was considered moderate in intensity and resolved after incision, drainage and antibiotics. There were no adverse events of special interest.</p><p>Overall, 14 of the 20 randomized subjects (70.0%) reported a total of 30 AEs, 9 of which assessed as related to tildrakizumab. The most common AE was hyperglycemia which was reported by 6 subjects (30.0%), none of which were assessed related to treatment. Three (3) subjects (15.0%) reported alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase.

The most common reasons were subject decision, adverse event and lost to followup. Five subjects withdrew due to pregnancy.</p><p>The long-term safety extension phases of the 2 Phase 3 trials provided approximately 11 months of additional safety data. Safety data from the Base period (64 weeks from P010 and 52 weeks from P011) was recoded from MedDRA Version 19.1 to MedDRA Version 20.0 to allow a comparison with this long-term safety data.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (SIB)</head><p>In the tildrakizumab development program, subjects were not excluded from enrollment based on a history of psychopathology. In response to the Agency concern regarding the relationship between immunomodulatory mechanisms of action of biologics and neuropsychiatric events, the applicant conducted a retrospective identification and adjudication of potential occurrences of suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB), using the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA) methodology. A blinded, external Clinical Adjudication Committee (CAC) at reviewed the data across the development program through June 2016. During the C-CASA analysis period, there were 3 adjudicated SIB events: 1 suicide attempt and 2 events of suicidal ideation in 1 subject (considered 1 event of suicidal ideation). Per CAC, the results of the C-CASA analysis do not support a safety signal for SIB in association with exposure to tildrakizumab. However, after the C-CASA analysis period, there were 3 reports of subjects with SIB events: 2 completed suicides and a subject reporting suicidal ideation. The assessment of causality is confounded in both cases. CAC indicated that these cases did not change their conclusions. See review by Jean Kim MD, Medical Officer from the Division of Psychiatry Products (DPP) (dated 10/19/2017) and section 7.3.5 Adverse Events of Special Interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deaths</head><p>There were 6 deaths among subjects enrolled in the Phase 3 Extension periods. Refer to Section 7.3.4 for a tabulation and discussion of the fatal adverse events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Serious Adverse Events</head><p>In the SUR extension period, the overall rate of SAEs was 11.3% (65 subjects) in the 100 mg group and 10.4% (61 subjects) in the 200 mg group. Among these SAEs, 1.7% (10 subjects) experienced SAEs which were assessed as related to tildrakizumab in the 100 mg group and 1.0% (6 subjects) experienced SAEs which were assessed as related to tildrakizumab in the 200 mg group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tier 1 Adverse Events</head><p>In the SUR extension period, the overall rate of Tier 1 AEs after adjudication (severe Infections, malignancies, melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, confirmed extended MACE, injection site reactions and drug-related hypersensitivity reactions) was greater in the 200 mg group (7.5%, 46 subjects) than the 100 mg group (6.9%, 43 subjects). The adverse events which appeared to show a dose response were injection site reactions (1.6%,10 subjects receiving 100 mg and 2.1%, 13 subjects receiving 200 mg), confirmed extended MACE (1.1%, 7 subjects receiving 100 mg and 1.6%, 10 receiving 200 mg) and melanoma (0%, 0 subjects receiving 100 mg and 0.2%, 1 receiving 200 mg) and non-melanoma skin cancer (0.2%, 1 subjects receiving 100 mg and 0.6%, 4 subjects receiving 200 mg).Note that not all non-melanoma skin cancers are included as Tier 1 events.</p><p>Reference ID: 4233639</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">(b) (4)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Infections</head><p>The overall incidence of severe infections (serious infections plus those requiring IV antibiotics) from the SUR was 2.7 % (17 subjects) in the tildrakizumab 100 mg group and 1.9 % (12) in the tildrakizumab 200 mg group. The types of severe infections reported in the long-term safety extension were similar to those observed in the Base period: sinusitis, pneumonia, cellulitis, gastroenteritis, urinary tract infection, and diverticulitis. In addition, a 68 -year-old Asian male receiving tildrakizumab 200 mg in the Extension period for approximately 22 months with normal liver function tests at baseline presented with nausea, abdominal pain and elevated liver function tests (total bilirubin 3.2 mg/dL, AST was 276 U/L, ALT 755 U/L, gamma GT 234 U/L, and ALP 410 U/L). Testing for Hepatitis E was positive. The source of the infection was consumption of wild boar meat. The study medication was withdrawn and the subject was discontinued from the trial.</p><p>Opportunistic Infections There were no new cases of tuberculosis or opportunistic infections (e.g. deep fungal or viral such as PML) reported in the Phase 3 Extension period. However, the SUR included 7 additional adverse events of herpes zoster (3 events associated with tildrakizumab 100 mg and 4 events associated with tildrakizumab 200 mg) and 1 event of ophthalmic herpes zoster associated with tildrakizumab 200 mg. In the pooled Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials and the extension periods, there were a total of 15 cases of herpes zoster (7 events associated with tildrakizumab 100 mg and 8 events associated with tildrakizumab 200 mg.) A total of 5/15 of these cases was assessed as related to the study product (3 events associated with tildrakizumab 100 mg and 2 events associated with tildrakizumab 200 mg.) See Section 7.3.5 [Opportunistic infections (OIs)] of this review for a discussion of the herpes zoster cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Malignancy</head><p>Greater numbers of neoplasms were identified in the SUR extension periods of the two Phase 3 trials than in the Base period of the pooled Phase 2/3 trials. Investigators reported equal numbers of solid tumors/hematologic malignancies in each dose group (10 or 1.6%). Small imbalances in non-melanoma/melanoma skin cancers were observed. The most common solid tumor was breast cancer but no malignancy was reported in greater than 0.5% of subjects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Injection site reactions</head><p>Because subjects in the 200 mg group receive twice the number of injections as subjects in the 100 mg group, an imbalance in injection site reactions is expected in the 200 mg group compared to the 100 mg group. Injection site reactions in the 100 mg tildrakizumab group included: injection site bruising, injection site pain, and injection site pruritus. Injection site reactions in the 200 mg tildrakizumab group included injection site bruising, injection site discomfort, injection site laceration, injection site pain and injection site swelling. A greater number of subjects in the 200 mg experienced pain/discomfort associated with administration of the study product in the 200 mg group (4 subjects) than the 100 mg group (1 subject.)</p></div>

The event was assessed as mild and did not result in interruption in treatment. A 62-year-old Asian male receiving tildrakizumab experienced urticaria on Day 1030 which resolved with treatment on Day 185. The event was assessed as mild and did not result in interruption in treatment. A 58-year-old White male with a history of drug hypersensitivity, experienced 2 adverse events of urticaria on Day 45 and Day 1192. On Day 45 (16 days after his last dose of placebo) he experienced urticaria with swelling of the tongue and left side of the throat. The event was assessed as a food allergy which resolved in 2 days with treatment with diphenhydramine 50 mg PO BID. On Day 1192, the subject experienced urticaria occurring 71 day after his last dose of tildrakizumab 100. The subject received diphenhydramine and prednisone and the event resolved by Day 1200. Both events were assessed a moderate and did not result in interruption in treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MACE</head><p>In the SUR extension period, total of 15 subjects (1.2%) had MACE events and 17 subjects (1.4%) had extended MACE events. One subject with a confirmed MACE event had a fatal outcome. See Section 7.3.4 and Section 7.4.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discontinuations Due to Adverse Effects</head><p>In the 100 mg tildrakizumab group, new AEs leading to discontinuation of trial medication during the SUR period included diverticulitis, aspartate aminotransferase increased, psoriatic arthropathy (2 subjects), clear cell renal cell carcinoma, invasive lobular breast carcinoma, metastatic carcinoma of the bladder, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and ovarian cancer. In the tildrakizumab 200-mg group, AEs leading to discontinuation of trial medication included hyperglycemia, breast cancer metastatic, papillary thyroid cancer, prostate cancer, coronary artery disease, tachycardia, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, bronchitis, Hepatitis E, transient ischemic attack, asphyxia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and psoriasis.</p><p>The SOC which accounted for the greatest number of discontinuations was the Neoplasms, benign, malignant and unspecified SOC (1.2% in the 100 mg group and 0.7% in the 200 mg group.) In addition, all the drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation in the 100 mg tildrakizumab group were in the Neoplasms SOC (diffuse B cell lymphoma, metastatic carcinoma of the bladder and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.) The single drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation in the 200 mg tildrakizumab group was in the Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders SOC (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/bronchitis.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Adverse Events</head><p>In the SUR period, a greater percentage of subjects in the tildrakizumab 200 mg group (3.6%) reported levels of aminotransferase ALT or AST 3 x ULN than subjects in the tildrakizumab 100 mg group (1.5%). Shift tables for the extension pool in the SUR showed the greatest upward shifts from normal baseline values in ALT (24-26%), followed by GGT (17-19%) and then AST (11-13%). In all cases, there was a dose response with greater shifts in the liver function tests in tildrakizumab 200 mg group compared to the 100 mg group.</p></div>

Subjects who became pregnant withdrew from treatment and, where feasible, were followed until delivery. Pregnancy outcomes such as spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and congenital anomalies were reported as SAEs. Based on the characteristics of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (large molecular with limited exposure in semen) and data from nonclinical studies with tildrakizumab, the applicant concluded that tildrakizumab does not pose a pregnancy risk for exposed partners. Therefore, the applicant did not document the occurrence of partner pregnancies. Refer to Section 5 for a discussion of the nonclinical findings.</p><p>Among subjects receiving tildrakizumab in the development program through May 27, 2017, there were 14 pregnancies: 2 pregnancies reported in the Phase 1 trials [(P05661 and P05839 (subject with active Crohn's disease)], and 2 pregnancies in in the Phase 2 trial (P05495), and 10 pregnancies in the Phase 3 trials/extension. Pregnancy outcomes included 6 cases of fetal loss (2 spontaneous abortions and 4 elective abortions) and 7 full-term live births, and 1 pending pregnancy outcome. The 7 full-term live births produced healthy infants with no reported congenital anomalies. The 2 spontaneous abortions occurred at 4 and 8 weeks of gestation in smokers who were exposed to tildrakizumab 200 mg. One of the subjects who experienced a spontaneous pregnancy loss had a history of 2 full term live births, a prior ectopic pregnancy and a miscarriage.</p><p>In addition, 2 subjects In Trial P011 receiving etanercept 50 mg became pregnant during the trial [last menstrual period (LMP) on Day 77 and Day 27] and delivered healthy infants without congenital anomalies.</p><p>The information that will be conveyed in labeling (Section 8.1 Pregnancy and Section 8.2 Lactation) regarding the risks of exposure to tildrakizumab during pregnancy and lactation is presented in Section 5.6 of this review. In addition, refer to the review (dated 12/21/2017) by Christos Mastroyannis, M.D., Division of Pediatric and Maternal Health, for recommendations regarding post marketing requirements to evaluate the risks of exposure to tildrakizumab during pregnancy and lactation.</p><p>Because the available data are insufficient to inform tildrakizumab associated risk in pregnant women, we will require that the applicant conduct: 1) a prospective, registry based observational exposure cohort study that compares the maternal, fetal, and infant outcomes of women exposed to tildrakizumab during pregnancy to an unexposed control population, and 2) a retrospective cohort study using claims or electronic medical record data or a case control study to assess adverse pregnancy, neonatal and infant outcomes of women exposed to tildrakizumab during pregnancy compared to an unexposed control population.Refer to Section 12 Postmarketing Requirements and Commitments for further details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Human Carcinogenicity or Tumor Development</head><p>As large proteins, monoclonal antibodies are not expected to gain access to the nucleus and directly interact with DNA to promote carcinogenesis. Tildrakizumab will be catabolized to peptides and constituent amino acids via normal metabolic pathways. However, for any product that produces immunosuppression and which is indicated for chronic administration, there is a theoretical risk of increased malignancy. In patients with psoriasis, this risk may be potentiated by prior exposure to other immunosuppressive agents or other therapies that may enhance tumor development such as phototherapy.</p><p>No animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of Reference ID: 4233639 tildrakizumab. Refer to Section 5.5.3 for a discussion of the carcinogenicity risk from a Pharmacology /Toxicology perspective.</p><p>Data from the nonclinical and clinical development programs do not support the conclusion that chronic administration of tildrakizumab is associated with an increased risk of carcinogenesis. However, the limited duration of observation during the drug development program is unlikely to allow detection of rare events with a long latency periods such as malignancy. Therefore, postmarketing data are needed to evaluate the long-term risk of malignancy in patients with psoriasis receiving tildrakizumab.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pediatrics and Assessment of Effects on Growth</head><p>The applicant has not conducted an evaluation of the safety and efficacy of tildrakizumab in the pediatric population. Because the proposed product is a new active ingredient, approval of tildrakizumab for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy triggers the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA)(21 U.S.C. 355c). Per the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), the applicant submitted an initial Pediatric Study Plan (iPSP) on December 11, 2015. The Agency agreed with the iPSP (Agreement Letter dated 6/9/2016).</p><p>In this submission, the applicant requested a partial waiver for studies in the pediatric population from birth to less than 6 years of age as "Necessary studies are impossible or highly impracticable due to the extremely low prevalence of moderate to severe psoriasis in this population." (Section 505B (a)(4)(B)(i) of the Act). Although the epidemiologic data are limited regarding the pediatric population with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, in general the prevalence of plaque psoriasis increases with age. In addition, the sponsor requested a deferral of studies in the pediatric population from age 6 years to &lt;18 years "until safety and efficacy in the adult indication has been demonstrated in Phase 3 studies" (Section 505B (a)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act).</p><p>In the discussion with PeRC (12/20/2017) regarding the evaluation of tildrakizumab in the pediatric population, the Division conveyed their agreement with the proposed pediatric development program in the Agreed iPSP and the proposed timeline. PeRC concurred with the Division. Refer to Section 12 for the pediatric study requirement for tildrakizumab under PREA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overdose, Drug Abuse Potential, Withdrawal, and Rebound</head><p>Overdose Overdose of the study product was defined as any dose higher than the dose specified in the individual trial protocol. During the Base period of the pooled Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials, there were 28 incidents of accidental overdose in 27 subjects. Among the 27 subjects with an incident of overdose, 5 subjects were randomized to tildrakizumab 100 mg, 13 subjects randomized to tildrakizumab 200 mg, 4 subjects randomized to placebo, and 5 subjects randomized to etanercept 50 mg. Most overdoses were mild in intensity (5 assessed as moderate) and did not result in adverse events. All overdoses resolved without sequelae.</p><p>No subject received a single dose of tildrakizumab greater than 200 mg.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Concerns Identified Through Postmarket Experience</head><p>Tildrakizumab is not marketed in any jurisdiction. Therefore, postmarketing safety data are not available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Expectations on Safety in the Postmarket Setting</head><p>The comprehensive analysis of the tildrakizumab safety data identified no safety signals. There are no safety concerns that are expected to change the favorable risk/benefit assessment or lead to increased risk with administration of tildrakizumab in the postmarket setting. However, additional data are needed to characterize the safety profile of the proposed product in special populations (pregnant and lactating females and the pediatric population age 6 years) and assess the risk of adverse events associated with long latency periods (malignancy) assess the risk of adverse events associated with long latency periods (malignancy). Refer to Section 12 of this review for the postmarketing requirements and commitments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Integrated Assessment of Safety</head><p>The safety profile for tildrakizumab was adequately characterized during the drug development program. The primary safety database consisted of subjects from the Phase 2 Trial P003 and Phase 3 Trials P010 and P011, and included 1083 subjects treated with tildrakizumab at the proposed dose of 100 mg SC. Of these 1083 subjects, 672 subjects were exposed for at least 12 months, 587 for 18 months, and 469 for 24 months.</p><p>Although there were no events of anaphylaxis, infrequent events of angioedema occurred in subjects treated with tildrakizumab. Information regarding hypersensitivity reactions will be conveyed in Section 4 (Contraindications) and Section 5.1 (Warnings and Precautions) in product labeling.</p><p>Treatment with tildrakizumab did not appear to increase the risk of mortality. There were no deaths reported in the 6 Phase 1 trials in subjects receiving tildrakizumab. During the Base period of the pooled Phase 2/3 trials, there were five deaths among subjects who received 100 mg tildrakizumab (unknown cause, alcoholic cardiomyopathy and steatohepatitis), and one death in a subject who received tildrakizumab 200 mg (aneurysm). Through May 27, 2017 (cutoff date for Safety Update Report), there were 6 additional deaths during the ongoing Phase 3 extension trials. None of the deaths occurring during the Base or Extension periods were assessed as causally related to the study product. Deaths are described in more detail in sections 7.3.4 and 7.3.8 of this review. Treatment with tildrakizumab was not associated with an increased incidence of treatment-related adverse reactions in the categories of suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).</p><p>During the Placebo-controlled period of the pooled Phase 2/3 trials, SAEs occurred in 1.4% of subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 mg, 2.3% of subjects treated with tildrakizumab 200 mg, 1.7% of subjects treated with placebo, and 2.2% of subjects treated with etanercept. Exposure adjusted rates of SAEs during the Base period were 5.81 per 100 subj years (yrs) in the tildrakizumab 100 mg group, 7.21 per 100 subj yrs in the tildrakizumab 200 mg group, 6.4 per 100 subj yrs placebo group and 13.4 per 100 subj yrs in the etanercept group.</p><p>During the Placebo-controlled period, the most common adverse reactions (AR) in subjects treated with tildrakizumab 100 mg were upper respiratory infections (13.9%), injection site reactions (3.4%), fatigue (2.4%), diarrhea (1.8%), back pain (1.3%), abdominal pain (1.3%), and nausea (1.0%). The frequency of AR was similar across all age and demographic groups. These are discussed in more detail in section 7.3.4 of this review. These AR are recommended to be included in Section 6 (Adverse Reactions) of tildrakizumab labeling.</p><p>Because of the mechanism of action of tildrakizumab, malignancy is a potential risk. A comparison of the number of malignancies (other than cervical cancers in situ or NMSC) from Phase 2/3 trials (P003, P010 and P011) in the tildrakizumab groups with data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute (2010-2014)* adjusted for age, sex, and race) indicated that the rate of these events in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis treated with tildrakizumab for up to 64 weeks was no higher than that expected for the general US population. However, because the risk of malignancy is biologically plausible and may exhibit a long-latency effect after initial exposure, more long-term data are needed to characterize the risk of malignancy.</p><p>Consultants from the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology (OSE) evaluated the sufficiency of the Active Risk and identification Analysis system (ARIA) to address the long-term risk of malignancy. ARIA is considered to be sufficient to assess the short-term risk for lymphoma, because lymphomas are reasonably well-validated in claims data, short-term risk is of interest, and the other domains (population, exposure, covariates, and analytic tools) were determined to be sufficient. However, ARIA is determined to be insufficient to assess the long-term risk for malignancy (i.e., all types), due to limited long-term follow-up, poor validation of certain malignancy types, and incomplete capture of potentially critical confounders. A long-term observational study would be a more appropriate post-marketing study design to better assess malignancy risk among tildrakizumab users; this study will be required post-approval.</p><p>Among subjects receiving tildrakizumab in the development program through May 27, 2017, there were 14 pregnancies: 2 pregnancies reported in the Phase 1 trials [(P05661 and P05839 (subject with active Crohn's disease)], and 2 pregnancies in in the Phase 2 trial (P003), and 10 pregnancies in the Phase 3 trials/extension. Pregnancy outcomes included 6 cases of fetal loss (2 spontaneous abortions and 4 elective abortions) and 7 full-term live births, and 1 pending pregnancy outcome. The effect of tildrakizumab on human reproduction and pregnancy is discussed in further detail in section 7.3.8 of this review. Because the available data are insufficient to inform tildrakizumab-associated risk in pregnant women, we will require postapproval prospective and retrospective studies assessing maternal, fetal and neonatal BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation -BLA 761067 ILUMYA (tildrakizumab) injection, for subcutaneous use 157 outcomes of women exposed to tildrakizumab during pregnancy compared to an unexposed control population. Refer to Section 12 Postmarketing Requirements and Commitments for further details.</p><p>The safety data currently available demonstrate that tildrakizumab is safe for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Postmarketing risk management will include professional labeling (including a Medication Guide), prescription status and routine pharmacovigilance. In addition, the ARIA system will be used to assess the risk of lymphoma over the short term. The long-term risk of malignancy will be assessed by a long-term observational study. The maternal, fetal, and infant outcomes of women exposed to tildrakizumab during pregnancy will be evaluated by a registry based observational exposure cohort study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary and Conclusions</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Issues</head><p>There were no major statistical issues affecting overall conclusions. The treatment effects for tildrakizumab were large and consistent across trials and endpoints. There were no substantial differences in efficacy among subgroups. The amount of missing data was relatively small (&lt; 6%) at Week 12 (i.e., the primary efficacy timepoint). For the handling of missing data, the statistical reviewer conducted an additional sensitivity analysis under the worst case scenario (i.e., missing data for tildrakizumab was imputed as non-responders and missing data for placebo was imputed as responders). In this extreme case, tildrakizumab remained statistically superior to placebo (p-values &lt; 0.001) for both co-primary efficacy endpoints in both pivotal trials (Trials P010 and P011).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4.2.">Conclusions and Recommendations</head><p>To establish the effectiveness of tildrakizumab, the applicant submitted data from two randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, pivotal Phase 3 trials (Trial P010 and Trial P011). The trials enrolled subjects 18 years of age and older who had plaque psoriasis with PASI score 12, Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score of 3 ("moderate") and a minimum body surface area (BSA) of involvement of 10%. The co-primary efficacy endpoints were the proportion of subjects achieving a PGA score of 0 ("cleared") or 1 ("minimal") with at least a 2-point improvement from baseline at Week 12 and the proportion of subjects achieving PASI 75 at Week 12. In both trials, tildrakizumab was statistically superior to placebo (p-values &lt; 0.001) for both co-primary efficacy endpoints at Week 12. Secondary endpoints for both trials included the proportion of subjects at Week 12 who achieved i) PASI 90 and ii) PASI 100. In both trials, tildrakizumab was statistically superior to placebo at Weeks 12 for both PASI 90 and PASI 100 (see Section 7.2.).</p><p>In To support the safety of tildrakizumab, the applicant pooled data from the Phase 3 trials with data from the proposed doses used in the Phase 2 Trial P05495 (P003), a 5-arm, dose rangefinding trial comparing 4 doses of tildrakizumab (5 mg, 25 mg,100 mg, 200 mg) with placebo. The applicant conducted a comprehensive assessment of the safety of tildrakizumab in the target population. The size of the safety database and the safety evaluations were adequate to identify local and systemic treatment-emergent adverse reactions.</p><p>Safety and efficacy data submitted by the applicant support approval of this BLA for tildrakizumab for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Drug substance (DS)</head><p>Tildrakizumab DS is expressed by Chinse Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line. There had been two tildrakizumab DS manufacturing processes (Process 1 and Process 2) throughout different clinical development stages. Process 1 was the initial tildrakizumab DS manufacturing process which was used to supply Phase 1/2 clinical trials. Process 2 was used to supply Phase 3 clinical trials and is the commercial DS manufacturing process. Manufacturing changes from Process 1 to Process 2 included a manufacturing scale change in order to meet increased supply demands during clinical development. The applicant conducted analytical comparability evaluations to support manufacturing changes of the DS used in clinical trials (see Product Quality review).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Drug products</head><p>Three different tildrakizumab drug products including lyophilized powder (LYO), 1.0 mL PFS, and 1.0 mL autoinjector (AI) have been used across the clinical trials <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">(Table 57</ref>). The two Phase 3 trials (P010 and P011) used the 1.0 mL PFS presentation which is also the to-be-marketed product proposed for registration in the BLA. The 1.0 mL AI presentation was only used in Study P009. Study P009 explored the relative BA between the PFS and AI presentations in a limited number of subjects with psoriasis. The applicant did not propose to register the AI presentation in the BLA.</p><p>Because the to-be-marketed formulation/presentation was used in Phase 3 trials, there is no need to bridge the to-be-marketed drug product to the clinical trial drug product. The applicant did not conduct dedicated clinical trials comparing PK between LYO used in Phase 1/2 clinical trials and PFS used in Phase 3 trials. The Applicant's exploratory population PK analysis indicated that LYO had approximately 5% lower bioavailability than PFS. The applicant developed and validated an electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based bridging immunoassay for measurement of tildrakizumab concentrations in human serum. The ECL assay used biotinylated IL-23 as capture agent and SULFO-TAG TM -labelled IL-23 as detection agent. In brief, biotinylated hIL-23, SULFO-TAG™-labeled hIL-23, were incubated with standards, QCs, and test samples and subsequently transferred to a streptavidin-coated Meso Scale Discovery ® plate. After incubation and washing, the ECL response from the bound SULFO-TAG™-labeled IL-23 was measured. The design of the assay using IL-23 as both capture and detection agent indicate that the ECL assay measures free drug concentrations. The validation parameters and performance of the ECL assay are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_19">Table 58</ref>. 13.5.1.2 Immunogenicity assays: bioanalytical methods for testing antidrug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing ADA</p><p>The applicant used electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based bridging immunoassays for assessment of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in tildrakizumab clinical trials. In brief, immunogenicity samples were diluted and incubated with biotinylated tildrakizumab (capture reagent) and SULFO-TAG TM -labeled tildrakizumab (detection reagent), and aliquots of the mixture were then pipetted onto streptavidin-coated Meso Scale Discovery ® plate. After washing and removal of unbound molecules, the ECL response from the bound SULFO-TAG TM -labeled tildrakizumab was detected.</p><p>Confirmed ADA positive samples were tested for neutralizing ADA (NAb). The NAb assay was a competitive ligand binding assay using biotinylated human IL-23 as capture reagent and SULFO-TAG TM -labeled human IL-23 as detection reagent. There were three generations of ADA and NAb immunoassays for immunogenicity assessment during the clinical development program. The three generations used the same ECL bridging design but differed in assay reagents (e.g., positive antibody controls) and assay characterization. <ref type="table" target="#tab_21">Table 59</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_64">Table 60</ref> provide the sensitivity and drug tolerance level of the ADA and NAb immunogenicity assays.

The initial assessment of the PK data does not indicate that drug interference would be a major issue for the ADA assay to detect ADA &gt;500 ng/mL because the mean±SD steady state serum tildrakizumab levels appear to be generally below the drug tolerance level of of the ADA assay. In contrast, the detection of NAb could be interfered with the presence of tildrakizumab in serum because the mean±SD steady state serum tildrakizumab concentrations were above the drug tolerance level of of the NAb assay. The initial assessment indicates that drug interference to the NAb assay presents a review issue for the Clinical Pharmacology and OBP review teams.</p></div>

The two extension phase suicides (and those in other psoriasis drug trials) point to this issue of baseline psychiatric risk, even apart from drug-related concerns. Although psychiatric safety monitoring has limitations and will not detect or prevent many psychiatric AEs or even most suicides, it is still a reasonable, cost-efficient, and relatively simple way to potentially address some events as they develop and trigger additional psychiatric attention as warranted. I strongly recommend that in future protocols for patients with psoriasis, or those who at least have a psychiatric history (including psychotropic medication use), prospective psychiatric safety monitoring be performed during clinical trials, including the extension phase, at each visit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. Background</head><p>Tildrakizumab is a novel high affinity humanized immunoglobulin G1/kappa antibody that specifically binds to the IL-23p19 subunit and blocks the interaction of human IL-23 with the IL-23 receptor. Tildrakizumab, in a 100 mg/mL solution, is administered as a subcutaneous injection via 1 mL single-dose prefilled glass syringe for the treatment of adults with moderateto-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.</p><p>Other psoriasis systemic therapies have targeted receptors such as IL-12, IL-23, IL-17, and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α. Some of these receptors have been associated with downstream psychiatric effects and are theorized to modulate neurotransmission.</p><p>IL-23 is a cytokine, produced mainly by activated myeloid cells, signaled by a heterodimeric IL-23 receptor complex combining an IL-23 receptor and IL-12Rβ1. IL-23 is known to drive autoimmune reactions in mouse models and human diseases via activation of a subset of T cells (Th17). Tildrakizumab is postulated to improve psoriasis via selective IL-23 blockade, and may leave IL-12 activity largely unaffected.</p><p>Increasing evidence suggests that cytokines are key mediators in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (possibly via hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis effects) and other psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia as well. Research studies have also noted altered cytokine levels (particularly IL-6 elevations in one review 1 and IL-2 and IL-4 and Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-β in another meta-analysis 2 ) in the cerebrospinal fluid of suicide attempters and completers compared to non-suicidal subjects. Psoriasis patients are also wellknown to have higher rates of depression, although it is unclear if the rates are mainly due to a primary immune-mediated cause, the high psychosocial burden of the illness, or a combination of both factors contributing to that increased risk. Adverse psychiatric effects with other IL inhibitors and anti-TNF-α agents used to treat psoriasis remain an area of concern. These agents include brodalumab (IL-17A inhibitor), infliximab (TNF-α inhibitor) and apremilast (PDE-4 inhibitor, which has downstream effects on cytokine blockade including IL-23 and IL-12), which have raised questions of potential disinhibition, anxiety, mood changes and/or lability, or suicidality. (Complicating matters is that some anti-psoriatic drugs like etanercept and adalimumab that are TNF-α blockers may also have antidepressant activity.) A literature review shows no known clear associations between IL-23 and psychiatric symptoms, although some researchers postulate that IL-23 has such effects and shows altered levels in schizophrenia 3 . One recent study showed no changes in IL-23 plasma levels after antidepressant treatment in patients with MDD 4 , but another showed possible increased serum IL-23 levels in patients with schizophrenia who were on depot antipsychotic medication versus healthy controls 5 . The clinical implications of these studies remain unclear. As noted above, one Phase 2 (P003, also referred to as P05495) and two Phase 3 clinical trials (P010 and P011) were performed with tildrakizumab. A total of 1994 subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were exposed to tildrakizumab during these Phase 2/3 trials in all phases (1413 during the placebo-controlled phase). The two Phase 3 trials used tildrakizumab doses of 100 mg and 200 mg and had a placebo-controlled phase only up until Week 12, after which subjects were re-randomized and continued dosing until Week 28. (Study P011 also had an active comparator arm using etanercept.) The Phase 2 trial had four different dose arms (5 mg, 25 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg) and a placebo arm until Week 16 (before dose adjustment and continued dosing until Week 52). For adverse event analysis, these trials were pooled during The Sponsor used MedDRA version 19.1 to code AE terms to preferred terms in the Phase 2 and 3 studies. I reviewed all the ADAE.xpt datasets for coding accuracy between AETERM and AEDECOD and found them satisfactory from a psychiatric AE perspective. I also reviewed subjects under the Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural Complications SOC under AEBODSYS, and no obvious miscodings of hidden psychiatric events were evident; they were all likely accidental/non-psychiatric in nature based on the limited information provided, except for the events that were coded already as psychiatric.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. Review of Clinical Data</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Selection of Relevant Clinical Trials</head><p>Psychiatric AE terms were found under AEBODSYS category for Psychiatric Disorder SOC. Under AEDECOD (preferred terms) they were as follows:</p><p>P003-insomnia, adjustment disorder with depressed mood, stress, nervousness, mood swings, depression P010-insomnia, anxiety, depression, irritability, agitation, mood swings, libido decreased, panic attack, suicide attempt, adjustment disorder P011-depression, major depression, insomnia, emotional disorder, anxiety, irritability, sleep disorder There were also numerous AEs coded under fatigue or tiredness, but I decided not to include them as psychiatric events since it would be difficult to distinguish their etiology from both the underlying medical condition of psoriasis and possible systemic drug effects versus any depressive etiology. Fatigue/tiredness AEs did not occur on drug at rates higher than placebo. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>i. Psychiatric AE Analysis</head><p>From my own JMP-based dataset review of ADAE.xpt from the Sponsor-provided pooled dataset, I found the following numbers of psychiatric SOC AEs: For placebo comparison, I determined the following: Dropout rates were fairly low and the treatment periods were similar (12 weeks for Phase 3, 16 weeks for the smaller Phase 2); therefore, the crude rates are expected to be reasonably reliable for comparing the treatment groups, and exposure-adjusted reporting rates are not presented, although the placebo-controlled period for P003 was 4 weeks longer than the others.  3 (0.4%) 1 (0.1%) 2 (2%) 6 (0.4%) 1 (0.3%) ALL Sleep (Insomnia) 3 (1%) 4 (0.6%) 7 (1%) 0 11 (0.7%) 2 (0.6%) ALL Psychiatric AEs** 5 (1.6%) 13 (1.8%) 15 (2.1%) 4 (4%) 32 (2.1%) 3 (0.8%) *Zero psychiatric AEs in Tildrakizumab 5 mg arm (N=42) of Study P003. **Three subjects had two psychiatric AEs during the placebo-controlled phase, one from each study. One was on placebo (P010), one was on 100 mg (P011), and one was on 200 mg (P003). Those duplicate subjects were removed from the totals in this row but not in the individual subcategory AE counts above. There were no nominally significant differences between tildrakizumab versus placebo for the above psychiatric AEs or subcategories per Fisher's exact test, even if via crude rates psychiatric AEs occurred at a higher rate on drug (2%) versus placebo (1%). However, power is limited by sample size, and exposure durations varied slightly with the Phase 2 versus Phase 3 trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ii. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (SI/B)</head><p>No SI/B-related deaths were reported in any of these three studies during the base study period. There were two suicides as per the October 3, 2017 Safety Update Report that occurred during the extension phase (one subject originally from P010 and one from P011).</p><p>There was also one subject in P010 who died reportedly from a toxic reaction between fluoxetine and cyclobenzaprine (although it is unclear how long the subject had been on those medications, or if elevated doses were taken-the autopsy report did note "prescription drug abuse") during the extension phase. The subject had a past history of depression and suicidal ideation. (There were also two deaths secondary to alcohol abuserelated medical sequelae during the Phase 2 and 3 trials, one of whom was adjudicated as "unknown cause" during C-CASA analysis.)</p><p>There was one suicide attempt during the placebo-controlled phase in Study P010, and two suicidal ideation events during the extension phase in Study P011. (There was also one suicidal ideation event in Phase 1 Study 007.) All of these events occurred on tildrakizumab.</p><p>Reference ID: 4169815</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">(b) (6) 8</formula><p>The differences between drug and placebo for the 12 to 16 week phase for SI/B events are not nominally statistically significant.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>iii. Case Summaries</head><p>Brief case summaries and WHO based causality assessments of the five SI/B events and two suspicious deaths from the tildrakizumab Phase 2 and 3 studies (and one SI/B event from Phase 1) were as follows: Unlikely, due to temporality, also had previous psychiatric history and medications (and facial nerve pain which has known suicide risk)</p><p>*Recoded after C-CASA analysis as SI event based on SAE report, originally coded as "depression" and "bipolar disorder" AEs only. **Recoded after C-CASA analysis as death of unknown cause ***Occurred since initial submission, during extension phase</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>iv. Anxiety and Insomnia</head><p>Reference ID: 4169815 (b) <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref> No clear associations are evident between tildrakizumab and anxiety and insomnia AEs when looking at the placebo-controlled AE data. There is no clear evidence of activation-related phenomena with this drug based on reported AEs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>v. Concomitant Medications</head><p>Subjects in each treatment arm were taking similar percentages of at least one concomitant psychotropic medication (slightly less in the etanercept group). This seems to indicate similar rates of baseline psychiatric morbidity between treatment groups. 23 subjects with psychiatric AEs (out of 38 total, 61%) were taking concomitant psychotropic medications at some point during the study (17 during screening, or 45%): 6 (2 of them during screening) from Study P003, 11 (7 during screening) from P010, and 6 (4 during screening) from P011. All but one (on etanercept who was on it during screening) were on study drug as well. This data indicates that the population on study drug developing psychiatric AEs might have had more pre-existing psychiatric morbidity than those developing psychiatric AEs who were not on study drug.</p><p>Treatment groups also were taking similar amounts of concomitant steroid medications (which have the potential to adversely affect mood, sleep, and anxiety). Thus, it does not seem likely that steroid medications confounded the comparison of psychiatric event rates. Of note, my AE results were slightly different than the Sponsor who noted the following Psychiatric AEs in the pooled placebo-controlled dataset in their Integrated Summary of Safety: Placebo: 3 (0.8%) Mine was 3. Tildrakizumab 100 mg: 13 (1.8%) Mine was 13. Tildrakizumab 200 mg: 14 (2.0%) Mine was 15. (I had one additional agitation AE that the Sponsor omitted.) Tildrakizumab 100+200: 27 (1.9%) Mine was 28. Etanercept: 5 (1.6%) Mine was 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Scale Data</head><p>The quality-of-life scales used are not designed for the assessment of primary psychiatric symptomatology. No other psychiatric scales were used in these studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. Other Consults/History</head><p>Tildrakizumab (an IL-23 p19 subunit inhibitor) is one of a few approved and/or studied medications that also act on IL-23, such as guselkumab (a monoclonal antibody to the p19 subunit to IL-23, FDA-approved in July 2017), ustekinumab (a monoclonal antibody to the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, FDA-approved in September 2009) and No clear SI/B or depression or anxiety signals were noted during the trials for these medications thus far.</p><p>Guselkumab had one completed suicide occur during the extension phase which was not felt to be related to the study medication, as per our division's prior consult review by John Umhau MD on 4/10/2017. No suicide attempts and one suicidal ideation AE on guselkumab during the placebo-controlled phase were noted in the trials. Both subjects with SI/B events had prior histories of depression. Retrospective C-CASA adjudication only noted an incidence rate of 0.10 per 100 subject-years for SI/B events for subjects on guselkumab. (Similar rates were found with secukinumab 0.06/100 and ixekizumab 0.14/100.) Overall psychiatric AEs on guselkumab also did not occur at a higher rate than placebo.</p><p>Other cytokine receptor inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of psoriasis, with concerns about effects on psychiatric symptoms and SI/B; in particular, brodalumab, which is an IL-17a receptor antagonist, received a boxed warning due to six suicides that occurred during its clinical trial program. Apremilast is a PDE-4 inhibitor that has some downstream effects on IL-23 and had some possible associations with depression and anxiety (leading to inclusion in the label). However, overall, the current literature on IL-23 and association with any psychiatric effects remains extremely limited and unremarkable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. Conclusions and Recommendations</head><p>Overall, the rates of psychiatric AEs were low in the tildrakizumab treatment group in the Phase 2 and 3 studies reviewed above. The low rates might, in part, be due to lack of formal psychiatric symptom monitoring in these trials; however, this interpretation can be counterbalanced by the lack of any psychiatric exclusion criteria for these studies (aside from substance abuse exclusion in one trial) and baseline elevated rates of depression and suicide risk in subjects with psoriasis. There was a slightly higher crude rate incidence of psychiatric AEs in the drug treatment group versus placebo (2% versus 1%) in the placebo-controlled phases of the Phase 2 and 3 trials, but these differences were not nominally statistically significant. SI/B events were extremely rare before C-CASA adjudication; only one confirmed suicide attempt occurred during the Phase 2 and 3 trials, in a subject with high psychiatric comorbidity (diagnosis of schizophrenia and on antipsychotic medication), although the timing of the incident (11 days after first dose) does not completely rule out a possible drug association.</p><p>Retrospective C-CASA adjudication only uncovered one additional suicidal ideation event (associated with a depression and bipolar AE previously reported) during the extension period and added one death of unknown cause (unlikely to be due to study medication, with concomitant alcohol abuse) which occurred in the placebo-controlled period.</p><p>During the update period up until 10/3/17, one additional suicidal ideation event and two suicides occurred during the extension studies. None of these new events appear to be associated with the study drug, and they all occurred in the context of pre-existing psychiatric morbidity.</p><p>For depression, anxiety, and insomnia events in these studies, drug causality seemed unlikely.</p><p>Other IL inhibitors have had potential psychiatric and CNS effects, and a class association cannot be completely ruled out at this time, although no clear signals are noted thus far and postmarketing data evaluation is ongoing.</p><p>My recommendations are as follows:</p><p>1. Given the two suicides recently reported in the extension safety update, and other ones that have occurred in clinical trial programs in patients with psoriasis, if not already implemented, I strongly recommend that DDDP ask Sponsors that in future protocols for all patients with psoriasis, or at the very least those who have a reported psychiatric history (including medications) before or during the trial, prospective psychiatric safety monitoring during clinical trials, including the extension phase, occur at each visit. This monitoring should include suicidal ideation and behavior monitoring that maps to C-CASA categories (such as the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) or Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale (S-STS)), and at least one psychiatric symptom monitoring scale such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (which screens for a wide range of psychiatric conditions) and/or a depression scale such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) or Physician Depression Questionnaire (PDQ). Anxiety or insomnia scales can also be considered as well. (The HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) has been used in some psoriasis trials.)</p><p>This psychiatric safety monitoring remains prudent given the baseline increased SI/B and psychiatric risk with subjects with psoriasis, plus the added risk of unknown potential immune modulator drug effects on psychiatric symptoms. All screening tools for suicidality and depression remain limited in terms of ability to predict or prevent SI/B events. Evidence on screening-related outcomes also remains inconclusive and contradictory, although of interest, the Canadian Dermatology-Rheumatology Comorbidity Initiative came to a consensus recommendation of depression screening for patients with psoriasis in the clinical setting. 6</p><p>Overall, this safety monitoring is a relatively simple and efficient method to potentially proactively intervene with at least some psychiatric concerns as they arise, and to provide better care and protection for clinical subjects in a population known to be at increased risk of psychiatric events. The data collected is also potentially helpful in terms of determining any existing direct drug-related effects or other causes or trends associated with SI/B or depression in this population.</p><p>2. Informed Consent documents should also advise subjects to contact the investigator if they experience new or worsening depression or suicidal ideation, because the intervals between visits can be very wide in some extension studies.</p><p>3. I do not recommend exclusion of subjects with psoriasis with a psychiatric history and/or medications from future trials, as it is important for them to be studied, in part because they represent a significant portion of real-world patients with psoriasis. For those subjects with a history of suicidality, the reviewer(s) and Sponsor(s) should usually consider that exclusion determination on a case-by-case risk-benefit basis for each protocol. As a general rule, those with recent suicidal behavior (i.e., attempts) within the past month and/or active SI/B on screening should be excluded and referred as needed to appropriate psychiatric intervention.</p><p>4. I do not recommend specific psychiatric warning language in the tildrakizumab label at this time, as there is insufficient evidence of increased risk of SI/B or other psychiatric issues thus far with tildrakizumab, in terms of direct drug-related effect, based on the current clinical trial data available. There is also no preliminary research thus far showing any clear association with IL-23 and psychiatric sequelae.</p><p>- <ref type="figure">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</ref> </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>-response for safety by concentration quartiles by Week 12 of Phase 3 trails (P010 and P011) ........................................................................................................... 71 Table 15: Effect of body weight on mean±SD serum tildrakizumab concentrations in Phase 3 trials .............................................................................................................................. 72 Table 16: Effect of body weight on clinical responses at Week 12 in Phase 3 trials ...... 73 Table 17: Model simulated Week 12 PASI response by body weight categories: 100 mg versus 200 mg ............................................................................................................................ 73</figDesc></figure>

Missing data was imputed using non-responder imputation (NRI). Subjects with missing baseline value were also imputed using NRI.(2) Comparison against placebo. P-value based on a CMH test stratified by baseline weight ( 90 kg / &gt;90 kg) and prior exposure to biologic therapy for psoriasis (Yes/No).Trial P011 included etanercept as an active comparator. In Trial P011, all subjects randomized to etanercept in the U.S. sites received U.S. licensed Enbrel (etanercept). Subjects randomized to etanercept at all other sites received EU approved etanercept. Because the applicant did not establish an adequate scientific bridge between U.S. licensed Enbrel and EU approved etanercept, these products are considered distinct products for the purpose of this review.</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">Tildrakizumab</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>200 mg</cell><cell>100 mg</cell><cell>Placebo</cell><cell>200 mg</cell><cell>100 mg</cell><cell>Placebo</cell></row><row><cell>Endpoint</cell><cell>(N=308)</cell><cell>(N=309)</cell><cell>(N=154)</cell><cell>(N=314)</cell><cell>(N=307)</cell><cell>(N=156)</cell></row><row><cell>PASI 90 (1)</cell><cell>109 (35%)</cell><cell>107 (35%)</cell><cell>4 (3%)</cell><cell>115 (37%)</cell><cell>119 (39%)</cell><cell>2 (1%)</cell></row><row><cell>P-value (2)</cell><cell>&lt;0.001</cell><cell>&lt;0.001</cell><cell>--</cell><cell>&lt;0.001</cell><cell>&lt;0.001</cell><cell>--</cell></row><row><cell>PASI 100 (1)</cell><cell>43 (14%)</cell><cell>43 (14%)</cell><cell>2 (1%)</cell><cell>37 (12%)</cell><cell>38 (12%)</cell><cell>0</cell></row><row><cell>P-value (2)</cell><cell>&lt;0.001</cell><cell>&lt;0.001</cell><cell>--</cell><cell>&lt;0.001</cell><cell>&lt;0.001</cell><cell>--</cell></row><row><cell cols="4">Source: Statistical Reviewer's Analysis (same as Applicant's Analysis)</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>(1)</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives:</head><p>The primary objectives of the E-R and longitudinal PK-PD model analyses were to: Quantify E-R for Week 12 PASI endpoints Understand the impact of key subject characteristics, especially weight, on the E-R relationship Compare projected PASI endpoints for 100 and 200 mg fixed-dose regimens relative to alternate weight-based regimens Characterize the longitudinal population PK-PD of PASI reduction for SC tildrakizumab in subjects with psoriasis Project the PASI response (PASI 75, PASI 90 and PASI 100 responders) over time for proposed tildrakizumab regimens in the induction and maintenance phases</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data:</head><p>Subjects from one Phase 2 trial (P05495) and two Phase 3 trials (P010 and P011) were included in the E-R and PK-PD modeling analyses. All subjects treated with tildrakizumab or placebo with valid post-treatment PASI results were included in the E-R analysis. Subjects treated with etanercept in Trial P011 were excluded in the modeling analysis. The average concentration from Week 1 to Week 12 was calculated using the individual PK parameters obtained from the final population pharmacokinetic (POP PK) model. Week 12 PASI 75, PASI 90 and PASI 100 response were imputed, if necessary, using last-observation-carried forward (LOCF).</p><p>The longitudinal PK-PD model analysis included the same subjects used in the E-R analyses. Time-course PASI results were collected up to Week 72. Time-matched tildrakizumab concentration were calculated using the individual PK parameters and the actual administered dose.</p><p>The baseline of the dataset for the PK-PD and E-R analysis is summarized in <ref type="table">Table 80</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 23: Longitudinal PK-PD Model Schematic Diagram</head><p>The mathematical description of the model is given as:</p><p>Where i denotes subject and P max is the maximum placebo response. The plaque formation rate is represented by the zero-order constant for production of the response (kin). PASI is the fraction of baseline, which ranges from 0 to 1. The plaque degradation rate is represented by the first-order rate constant for loss of the response (kout). The variables PTR1, PTR2, and PTR3 reference three sequential PASI transit compartments, each with transit rate constant (ktr). The drug effect is a standard Emax model, where Cpij is the predicted time course from the POP PK model using posthoc parameters. The placebo effect is a sudden increase in healing, which persists throughout the trial. The residual error model was additive in the logittransformed PASI reduction.</p></div>

Covariates found to be significant in the E-R analysis were also tested in the PK-PD analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simulations</head><p>Simulations were used to characterize PASI response based on population parameters from the PK-PD/E-R models, including sampled covariates from the Phase 2 and 3 subject populations.
