CSL830 will be marketed as a single-use vial available in two sizes: 2000 International Units (IU) with 4mL water for injection and 3000 International Units (IU) with 6 mL water for injection each containing 500 IU/ml C1-esterase inhibitor after reconstitution.</p><p>Four clinical study reports (CSR) are included in the submission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3001</head><p>Study 3001 was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, incomplete-crossover safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic (PK) study for routine prophylaxis to prevent hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks in adolescent and adult subjects 1 with HAE type I or II. A placebo solution consisting of reconstituted human albumin solution with CSL830 excipients was used to match the protein-based C1-INH solution. The primary endpoint was time-normalized number of HAE attacks, identical to the indication granted for IV C1-INH (Berinert). Secondary efficacy endpoints included the percentage of responders and time-normalized number of uses of rescue medication 2 . <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> summarizes dosing of investigational product and placebo during the two treatment periods, Treatment Period 1 (TP1)and Treatment Period 2 (TP2).

Study duration for individual subjects was up to 45 weeks. To maintain the study blind, subjects randomized to receive 40 IU/kg (0.08 mL/kg) CSL830 in one treatment period were administered placebo at the higher volume (0.12 mL/kg) in the other treatment period. Similarly, subjects randomized to receive 60 IU/kg (0.12 mL/kg) CSL830 in one treatment period were administered placebo at the lower volume (0.08 mL/kg) in the other treatment period. Treatment allocation was in a 1:1:1:1 sequence.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3002</head><p>Study 3002 is an ongoing phase 3, open-label, randomized, long-term safety study in subjects with HAE. Primary endpoints include AEs leading to premature study discontinuation, TEEs, anaphylaxis, HAE attacks resulting in hospitalization, local injection site AEs, related SAEs (SAR), and anti-C1-INH antibodies. Time-normalized number of HAE attacks is an exploratory efficacy endpoint. Upon completion, this study will provide 2-year safety and tolerability data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2001</head><p>Study 2001 was a phase 2, multicenter, open-label, crossover, dose-ranging PK, pharmacodynamic (PD), safety and tolerability study using 3 dosing regimens (1500 IU, 3000 IU and 6000 IU twice per week for 4 weeks) in subjects with HAE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1001</head><p>Study 1001 was a phase 1, single center, randomized, double blind, double-dummy crossover, dose-ranging PK, PD and safety study that compared a single IV dose of 1500 IU CSL830 with a single IV dose of 1500 IU Berinert in healthy volunteers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EFFICACY Study 3001</head><p>Twice per week SC doses of 40 IU/kg and 60 IU/kg CSL830 significantly reduced mean time-normalized number of HAE attacks from 0.12 to 0.04 attacks/day (3.61 to 1.19 attacks/month) using 40 IU/kg compared with high-volume placebo (p &lt; 0.001) and from 0.13 to 0.02 attacks/day (4.03 to 0.52 attacks/month) using 60 IU/kg compared with lowvolume placebo (p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Secondary endpoint outcomes were supportive.</p><p>• Three subjects in Study 3001 experienced 4 unrelated SAEs: a TEE (pulmonary embolism) in one placebo subject, angioedema and syncope in another placebo subject, and urosepsis in a 40 IU/kg CSL830 subject. No cases of anaphylaxis were reported.</p><p>Nine subjects in Study 3002 experienced 11 unrelated SAEs: 5 SAEs (bronchitis, contusion, dehydration, hypokalemia and lymphoma) in four 40 IU/kg subjects and 6 SAEs (myocardial infarction, diplopia, cholelithiasis, pneumonia, chest pain and dizziness) in five 60 IU/kg subjects.</p><p>Two subjects in Study 2001 experienced 2 unrelated SAEs: syncope (before initiation of CSL830) and hypovolemic shock.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse Reactions (AR) 3</head><p>The most frequent safety events reported in &gt;4% of CSL subjects were injection site reaction <ref type="bibr">(27/86 or 31.4% vs. 21/86 or 24.4%,</ref><ref type="bibr">CSL830 vs. placebo,</ref><ref type="bibr">respectively)</ref>, nasopharyngitis (9/86 or 10.5% vs. 6/86 or 7.0%), hypersensitivity (5/86 or 5.8% vs. 1/86 or 1.2%) and dizziness (4/86 or 4.7% vs. 1/86 or 1.2%).</p><p>More CSL830 subjects in Study 3001 experienced systemic AEs than injection site ARs.</p><p>• Systemic AEs were experienced by 55.8% vs. 55.8% of subjects, CSL830 vs. placebo, respectively; the incidence was higher in 60 IU/kg CSL830 subjects than in 40 IU/kg CSL830 subjects (58.1% and 53.5%, respectively). Most cases were mild (44.2% vs. 41.9%, 60 IU/kg vs. 40 IU/kg, respectively), with fewer subjects experiencing moderate <ref type="bibr">(27.9% vs. 20</ref>.9%) intensity ARs and far fewer experiencing severe (4.7% vs. 4.7%) intensity ARs.</p><p>• Local ARs were experienced by 31.4% vs. 24.4% of subjects, CSL830 vs. placebo, respectively). The most common reactions were pain and erythema, with a higher incidence reported in the 60 IU/kg cohort than in the 40 IU/kg cohort (34.9% vs. 27.9%). These events typically occurred within 24 hours after injection and resolved within 24 hours after onset. Most cases were of mild (34.9% vs. 25.6%) or moderate (11.6% vs. 4.7%) intensity and none was graded as severe or resulted in discontinuation of product administration.</p><p>Three cases of rash were reported in 3 subjects (40 IU/kg, 60 IU/kg and placebo), 9 cases of urticaria in 2 subjects (60 IU/kg, 40 IU/kg), and 2 cases of conjunctivitis (40 IU/kg).</p><p>No case of transmission of viral infections (i.e., HIV, HBV, or HCV) was reported.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ASSESSMENT</head><p>Twice per week SC administration of 40 IU/kg or 60 IU/kg CSL830 is safe and effective for routine prophylaxis to prevent HAE attacks in adolescent and adult patients. SC administration offers a convenient option for patients who wish to avoid intravenous injections. Of the 2 doses evaluated in phase 3 studies, 60 IU/kg has the best benefit / risk profile, providing better efficacy and more favorable outcomes than the 40 IU/kg dose, with no evidence of dose-dependent safety concerns.</p></div>

Clinical and Regulatory Background</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Disease or Health-Related Condition(s) Studied</head><p>HAE is characterized clinically by unpredictable and recurrent attacks of edema affecting the SC tissues of the face, trunk, or limbs, or the submucosal tissues of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary tracts. Attacks can be painful, disfiguring, and disabling. Laryngeal attacks are the most serious concern in HAE and can be fatal.</p><p>HAE is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a gene mutation on chromosome 11 that affects the production of C1-INH protein. There are two main types of HAE. HAE type I (approximately 85% of patients) is characterized by low concentrations of functional C1-INH protein. HAE type II (approximately 15% of patients) is characterized by "normal" concentrations of functionally deficient C1-INH protein.</p><p>C1-INH is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) that regulates activation of the complement, contact (kallikrein/kinin) 4 and coagulation systems by binding to and inactivating target serine proteases. Dysregulation of these systems because of C1-INH deficiency results in the uncontrolled production of vasoactive peptides (e.g., bradykinin) that promote inflammation through increased vascular permeability and excessive fluid accumulation in body tissues.</p><p>The diagnosis of HAE is confirmed by low complement component 4 (C4) antigen and absent or greatly reduced C1-INH antigen (protein) or C1-INH functional activity. C4 is a component of the classical complement pathway that is digested by active complement component 1 (C1) when C1 is not inhibited by C1-INH. Typical C1-INH functional activity in untreated HAE patients is between 5% and 30% of normal. Enhanced activation of the complement system has been observed with C1-INH functional activity of &lt; 38% of normal, suggesting a minimum threshold of C1-INH function to protect against HAE symptoms.</p><p>HAE is estimated to affect approximately 1 in 50,000 individuals, with no ethnic predominance, suggesting that more than 6000 individuals are affected in the U.S.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Currently Available, Pharmacologically Unrelated Treatment(s)/Intervention(s) for the Proposed Indication(s)</head><p>Therapeutic approaches to HAE include • Acute or "on-demand" treatment administered after an HAE attack begins • Long-term prophylaxis to prevent or minimize attacks • Short-term prophylaxis to prevent attacks caused by known triggers such as medical, dental, or surgical procedures Unrelated products approved for treatment of HAE attacks include • SC: Kalbitor (kallikrein inhibitor)</p><p>• SC: Firazyr (bradykinin receptor antagonist) Unrelated products approved for prophylaxis of HAE attacks include • PO: danazol, stanozolol (attenuated androgens)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Safety and Efficacy of Pharmacologically Related Products</head><p>CINRYZE is a human plasma-derived C1-inhibitor indicated for routine intravenous prophylaxis of adult and adolescent patients with HAE. The safety and efficacy of CINRYZE prophylaxis therapy to reduce the incidence, severity, and duration of HAE attacks was demonstrated in a single randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter cross-over study of 24 subjects. The only serious adverse reaction observed was cerebrovascular accident. The most common adverse reactions observed (≥8% of subjects) were headache, nausea, rash, and vomiting.</p><p>RUCONEST is a C1 esterase inhibitor [recombinant] indicated for intravenous treatment of acute attacks in adult and adolescent patients with HAE. The efficacy of RUCONEST was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study, supported by two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies. Adverse reactions (≥ 2% of subjects) reported in clinical trials were headache, nausea, and diarrhea.</p><p>Berinert (plasma-derived C1-inhibitor) was approved in 2009 for intravenous treatment of HAE attacks. In clinical trials, the most serious adverse reaction associated with its use was an increase in the severity of pain associated with HAE; the most common adverse reactions (&gt;4% of subjects) were nausea, dysgeusia (distorted sense of taste), abdominal pain and vomiting (Berinert Prescribing Information).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.1">Mechanism of Action</head><p>C1-INH is a normal constituent of human plasma that inhibits the complement, contact (kallikrein/kinin) and coagulation systems. Suppression of contact system activation by C1-INH and inactivation of plasma kallikrein and factor XIIa is thought to modulate vascular permeability by preventing generation of bradykinin. 4 Since HAE patients have absent or low levels of functional C1-INH, administration of HAEGARDA is designed to replace the missing or malfunctioning C1-INH protein.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.2">Human Pharmacodynamics (PD)</head><p>In untreated patients, insufficient levels of functional C1-INH lead to increased activation of C1, which results in decreased levels of complement component 4 (C4). The administration of HAEGARDA increases plasma levels of C1-INH in a dose-dependent manner and subsequently increases plasma concentrations of C4. The C4 plasma concentrations after S.C. administration of 60 IU/kg HAEGARDA were in the normal range (16 to 38 mg/dL).</p></div>

In both TP 1 and TP 2, subjects received CSL830 or placebo (a reconstituted human albumin-based solution with CSL830 excipients) as a single SC injection (preferably in the abdomen) twice per week for 16 weeks. Two doses of CSL830 were evaluated: 40 IU/kg (0.08 mL/kg) and 60 IU/kg (0.12 mL/kg). Subjects randomized to receive 40 IU/kg CSL830 in one TP received high-volume placebo (0.12 mL/kg) in the other treatment period. Alternatively, subjects randomized to receive 60 IU/kg CSL830 in one treatment period received low-volume placebo (0.08 mL/kg) in the other treatment period. Investigators, study center staff, and subjects were blinded to subject treatment allocation and the order of active treatment and placebo within sequences. Electronic diaries were used to capture "real time" subject recorded data, including the daily recording of HAE symptoms (e.g., anatomic location and severity), the use of rescue medication, details of the administration of investigational product, and the occurrence of injection site reactions. Subjects rated the severity of their HAE symptoms using the following definitions:</p><p>• Mild: A symptom that does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living • Moderate: A symptom that interferes with usual activities of daily living • Severe: A symptom that interrupts usual activities of daily living HAE attacks were reported by investigators. At each study visit, the investigator was to review the subject electronic diary, relevant interim medical history, including hospital / medical records, and any other information provided by the subject. Using medical judgment, and in consideration of the HAE attack reporting guidelines, the investigator reported the start / stop dates, all involved anatomic locations, and the maximum symptom severity of HAE attacks on the HAE Attacks electronic case report form. Each HAE attack was to be preceded by and followed by an attack-free day.</p><p>6.1.8 Endpoints and Criteria for Study Success 1. Primary endpoint: time-normalized number of HAE attacks. 2. Secondary endpoints a. Percentage of "responders" defined as a ≥ 50% relative reduction in the time-normalized number of HAE attacks during infusion of CSL830 compared with placebo (within individual subjects). "Success" was defined as a responder rate of &gt; 33% (lower 95% confidence interval). b. Time-normalized number of uses of rescue medication. c. Adverse events (AEs) that began within 24 hours after the administration of investigational product. d. AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), systemic AEs, suspected adverse drug reactions, thromboembolic events (TEEs), anaphylaxis events, sepsis and / or bacteremia events, increased risk scores for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, inhibitory anti C1-INH antibodies, or clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory assessments. e. Injection-site AEs: pain, swelling, bruising, itching, or erythema at the investigational product injection site.</p></div>

The percentage reduction (%) in time-normalized number of HAE attacks per subject was calculated as: 100 x [1 -(the time-normalized number of HAE attacks when treated with CSL830) / (the time-normalized number of HAE attacks when treated with placebo)] a) <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 5</ref> shows that 68/90 (82.9%) of subjects in the CSL830 treatment cohort experienced a ≥50% reduction in number of HAE attacks compared with placebo. a Percentages are based on the number of subjects (N) included in the analysis. Subjects whose time-normalized number of HAE attacks could not be calculated in 1 or both treatment periods were excluded from the analysis. Subjects with 0 attacks on high-volume placebo (N=4) were classified as nonresponders because a percentage reduction could not be calculated for these subjects. b The difference between CSL830 doses is assessed using Wilson asymptotic confidence limits for the difference in percentages. Adapted from  <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">Table 6</ref> shows that 74.4% and 50.0% of subjects experienced a ≥70% and ≥90% reduction in HAE attacks, respectively. Subgroup results for time-normalized number of HAE attacks were similar to the overall analysis results (i.e., rate of attack was lower on CSL830 than placebo, and 60 IU/kg exerted a stronger treatment effect than 40 IU/kg CSL830). Subgroup results for the percentage of responders were similar to the overall analysis results (i.e., the proportion of responders was higher using 60 IU/kg than 40 IU/kg CSL830. Meaningful assessment by race was precluded because the majority of subjects were White (84/90, 93.3%).

Prior to her participation in the study, IV C1-INH (Berinert) was administered for acute treatment of HAE attacks. No medical / surgical history for the preceding 6 month before screening was reported. Relevant medical history was remarkable for a reported but probably untested childhood allergy to penicillin. In adulthood, there was a history of an allergy to local anesthetics used in a dental procedure that was associated with facial, tongue, and upper airway edema. Skin prick testing, performed in 1999 was positive to local anesthetics. The subject was not reported to have a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, eczema, or urticaria. There were no recent changes in laundry soap, bathing soap, sunscreen, or lotions.</p><p>On 18 August 2014, she was randomized to receive 60 IU/kg CSL830 subcutaneously twice weekly over a 4 week period. Following randomization, the subject experienced no additional HAE attacks through 24 September 2014. With the fifth administration of 60 IU/kg CSL830, the first urticarial reaction was reported (mild severity). The following 3 administrations were followed by urticarial reactions at additional locations (arms, legs, abdomen) with increasing intensity (severe) and itching. These symptoms developed the day after each 60 IU/kg CSL830 injection and lasted approximately 1 to less than 3 days. These were isolated symptoms without accompanying gastrointestinal distress or respiratory distress / wheezing. The subject did not have any injection site reaction.</p><p>The investigator reported that these AEs were probably related to 60 IU/kg CSL830, and the subject's participation was discontinued. The investigator's assessment was based on the facts that symptoms occurred after 60 IU/kg CSL830 administration and increased in severity with subsequent dosing. Following the discontinuation of 60 IU/kg CSL830 (last administered on 11 September 2014), the subject experienced 2 additional episodes of Urticaria (on 17 September 2014 and on 22 September 2014). The additional AEs were reported as related and had an outcome of resolved. The End of Study Visit was on 29 September 2014 (TP1 / Day 42).

Median increases were similar on 60 IU/kg and 40 IU/kg. • Prothrombin fragment 1 and 2 concentrations above the normal range were reported at Baseline, with values as high as (the upper limit of quantification of the assay). However, during treatment with CSL830, the (b) (4) prothrombin fragment 1 and 2 concentrations decreased (i.e., moved towards normal), and the decreases were greater on 60 IU/kg than on 40 IU/kg. This decrease was not observed during treatment with placebo. • D-dimer concentrations above the normal range were reported at Baseline in subjects during Study 3001 and 3002. During treatment with CSL830, D-dimer concentrations decreased. In contrast, D-dimer concentrations similar to values reported at Baseline were seen during treatment with placebo. In Study 2001, concentrations of D-dimer above the normal range were reported at baseline. Mean (SD) changes in D-dimer from Screening to the Exit Visit ranged from -0.464 (1.742) mg FEU/L (fibrinogen equivalent units; normal: &lt;0.5 ug/mL FEU) to 0.929 (7.466) mg FEU/L across the 3 CSL830 dosing regimens, respectively. A few outliers skewed mean levels, so some summary results are above the reference range. A higher proportion of subjects treated with the CSL 1500 IU (20 IU/kg) dosing regimen (16.7% [2 / 12]) experienced shifts from normal to high Ddimer values from Screening to the Exit Visit compared to the 3000 IU (40 IU/kg) and 6000 IU (80 IU/kg) dosing regimens (8.3% [1 / 12] each). • Plasmin-α2-antiplasmin (PAP) levels were only measured in Study 3001, and were elevated at Baseline.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.1">Risk-Benefit Considerations</head><p>HAE is a serious and at times, life-threatening condition that can occur without warning. Failure to rapidly and effectively treat laryngeal involvement, in particular, can result in asphyxiation. Effective prophylaxis is preferable to on-demand treatment but long-term therapy is limited to Cinryze, a plasma-derived C1-inhibitor administered intravenously. Even though HAEGARDA also is plasma-derived, subcutaneous administration offers an attractive alternative to patients who dislike the inconvenience of intravenous Cinryze. Patients should be made aware that HAEGARDA can be associated with the class effects as other C1-INH products.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Condition</head><p>• HAE is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition that can occur without warning.</p><p>• HAE prophylaxis reduces the incidence of attacks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Benefit</head><p>• HAEGARDA prophylaxis therapy reduces the risk of attacks in adolescent and adult patients.</p><p>• Twice-weekly prophylaxis therapy is effective in patients who prefer the subcutaneous route of administration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risk</head><p>• Class effects include hypersensitivity reactions, thromboembolic events and transmission of infectious agents (HAEGARDA is plasma-derived). Injection site reactions (pain and erythema), hypersensitivity, nasopharyngitis and dizziness were the most frequent safety events reported with use of HAEGARDA.</p><p>• HAEGARDA prophylaxis is associated with local injection site reactions in approximately 30% of subjects. Other reactions occur less frequently. Adverse reactions are dose-related.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risk Management</head><p>• Patients should be made aware of potential signs/symptoms of serious adverse reactions such as hypersensitivity, thrombosis and transmission of infectious agents, as well as local injection site reactions.</p><p>• Monitor for signs of hypersensitivity, thrombosis, infections local injection site reactions. </p></div>

Both study populations consisted of male or female subjects with a biochemically confirmed diagnosis of HAE type I or II. The minimum age criterion was 12 years in Study 3001 and 6 years in Study 3002. • The majority of subjects in both studies had HAE type I • Subjects in both studies must have experienced ≥ 4 HAE attacks over a consecutive 2-month period within the 3 months before the Screening Visit. In Study 3001, subjects also must have experienced ≥ 1 HAE attack during the first 2 weeks of the Run-in Period or ≥ 2 HAE attacks during any consecutive 4-week period of the Run-in Period to be eligible for randomization. • In Study 3001, the most commonly reported medical history events were in the system organ classes of Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders (31.1% of all subjects), Nervous System Disorders (30.0%), and Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (26.7%). In Study 3002, the most commonly reported medical history events were in the system organ classes of Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders (28.6% of all subjects), Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (25.4%), and General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (24.6%). 6.4.12.6 7.

Cumulatively, subjects who participated in both studies were exposed to CSL830 for up to 74 weeks. The interim, exploratory efficacy results of open-label Study 3002 support the efficacy of SC CSL830 for routine prophylaxis to prevent HAE attacks, and demonstrate that the effect is maintained over time periods of up to 1 year.No association was identified between treatment with CSL830 and detection of noninhibitory anti-CI-INH antibodies, and no inhibitory anti-CI-INH antibodies were detected.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Subgroup analyses of the exploratory efficacy endpoint in Study 3002 were not performed. • Efficacy results from the double-blind, placebo-controlled Study 3001 support the efficacy of SC CSL830 for routine prophylaxis to prevent HAE attacks in adolescent and adult patients. • In pivotal Study 3001, a dose-response was observed across efficacy endpoints, with 60 IU/kg consistently showing better efficacy than 40 IU/kg. Since laryngeal HAE attacks are serious and life-threating, the 60 IU/kg twice weekly dosing regimen as proposed in the draft Prescribing Information is the dose that should be approved. • Interim results from Study 3002 demonstrate that the effect of CSL830 is maintained over time periods of up to 1 year. 8.

However, in countries where Berinert is licensed, Berinert was offered and provided as needed to subjects who elected to use C1-INH as rescue medication for the acute treatment of HAE attacks. The use of IV Berinert as a rescue medication for the acute treatment of HAE attacks was permitted at any time during the Run-in Period, TP1, and TP2. Subjects were also permitted to use other plasma-derived or recombinant C1-INH, icatibant (a bradykinin antagonist), ecallantide (a kallikrein inhibitor), and fresh frozen plasma as rescue medications.(b) (4) (b) (4) Clinical Reviewer: Laurence Landow STN: 125606/0</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3">For the purposes of this review, the difference between an adverse event (AE) vs. adverse reaction (AR) is based on the hierarchy presented in FDA's "Guidance: Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies", in which an AR is defined as an "untoward medical occurrence associated with use of a drug" (=AE) where there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. Nonserious AEs that lacked sufficient information in the application to make a causality determination were classified as ARs.</note>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment</head><p>Local injection site ARs occurred in more CSL830 subjects (48.0%) than placebo (24.4%) subjects, especially injection site pain where the rate was almost twice that of placebo subjects (20.3% vs. 10.5%). Most likely due to random variation, the rate of local injection site ARs was slightly higher in the 40 IU/kg cohort than either the 60 IU/kg (38.8%) or placebo (24.4%) cohorts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.4.8">Adverse Events of Special Interest</head><p>Two TEEs were observed in the pooled phase 3 studies: a pulmonary embolism in Study 3001and an acute myocardial infarction in Study 3002. At the time of reporting, the investigator was blinded and assessed the pulmonary embolism as related to investigational product (i.e., placebo). No other SAEs, including the event of myocardial infarction, were ultimately reported as related to CSL830.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NARRATIVES</head><p>• Subject , a 50-year-old female, experienced an SAE of pulmonary embolism during treatment with high-volume placebo in TP1 of Study 3001. The subject was not exposed to CSL830 during the study, and was using Berinert and Firazyr to treat emerging HAE attacks. The event was severe, led to study discontinuation, and had an outcome of recovered / resolved. The subject had a family history of TEEs (father, brother, and sister experiencing TEEs at a similar age). The subject had a history of heavy smoking and was symptomatic before the first administration of the investigational product in Study 3001.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Subject</head><p>, a 47-year-old female, experienced an SAE of myocardial infarction during treatment with 60 IU/kg CSL830. At the time of the interim data cut-off for Study 3002, the SAE was reported by the investigator as related to CSL830. However, after the interim data cut-off, the investigator's revised assessment was received that it was not related to CSL830. The cardiologist's evaluation concluded that the cause was likely due to a "spontaneous plaque rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque with associated mild clot formation, rather</p><p>Clinical Reviewer: Laurence Landow STN: 125606/0</p><p>Page 89 than a spontaneous coronary thrombosis". The subject was overweight, was a heavy smoker (&gt; 20 cigarettes / day for years), and had hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. The event led to study discontinuation. The event was graded as severe. The outcome of the event was recovered / resolved.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.5.3">Product-Demographic Interactions</head><p>In general, there was no pattern in any of the age subgroups that indicated a relevant effect of age on the frequency or rate of AEs. An analysis of AEs by sex was not performed because there is no clinical rationale to expect that there should be a difference in the safety profile of CSL830. An analysis of AEs by race was not performed because most subjects (&gt; 90% in any treatment) in the CSL830 clinical program were White.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.5.4">Product-Disease Interactions</head><p>In the pooled population, 60 / 152 subjects overall had a cumulative study duration of &gt; 1 year, whereas most subjects had a cumulative study duration of ≤ 1 year (92 / 152 subjects). The type, frequency, and rate of AEs reported in the SOCs were generally similar in both subgroups; in the SOCs with differences between the subgroups, no meaningful clinical differences were observed 8.5.5 Product-Product Interactions Very few subjects used oral prophylaxis for the treatment of HAE attacks, and thus comparison in these subgroups is difficult.</p></div>
