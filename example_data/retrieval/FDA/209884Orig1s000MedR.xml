<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Product Introduction</head><p>Siponimod (BAF312) is an oral sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator that binds to the S1P1 and S1P5 subtypes of the five known S1P receptors. The S1P receptors are ubiquitous in the body and have protean biologic functions, as per <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref>. Presumably, modulating S1P1 to limit the egress of lymphocytes from secondary lymphoid tissue at least partially explains the efficacy of this class of medications in preventing relapses in patients with relapsing MS. Siponimod is purportedly more selective than the currently approved S1P receptor modulator for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (fingolimod), which interacts with S1P1, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5; therefore, siponimod may hypothetically mitigate some of the safety concerns with fingolimod, some of which are presumed to be at least partially modulated by S1P3 <ref type="bibr">(Horga and Montalban, 2008)</ref>.  <ref type="bibr">Horga and Montalban (2008)</ref>. 1 S1P1 is expressed on atrial myocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Camm et al 2014)</ref>. Siponimod is presented as sipominod fumaric acid <ref type="bibr">(co-crystal)</ref>. The molecular formula of the free form is C29H35F3N2O3, with a molecular mass of 516.61 g/mol. The molecular formula of the drug substance is C4H4O4 29H35F3N2O3 with a molecular mass of 1149.2 g/mol. The drug substance is achiral. Siponimod shows no significant light absorption in the sunlight range between 290 and 700 nm and therefore has no phototoxic potential. The CAS No. for siponimod fumaric acid is 1234627-85-0 and the CAS name is 1- phenyl] methoxy]imino] ethyl]-2-ethylphenyl]methyl]-3-azetidinecarboxylic acid (2E)-2-butenedioate (2:1).</p><p>Siponimod is provided as 0.25 mg and 2 mg film-coated tablets for oral use. Each film coated tablet contains 0.25 mg or 2 mg siponimod, equivalent to 0.2 mg or 2.22 mg as siponimod fumaric acid co-crystal, respectively. Siponimod film-coated tablets contain the following inactive ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone, glyceryl behenate, lactose monohydrate, colloidal silicon dioxide with a film coating containing lecithin (soy), iron oxides (red and black iron oxides for the 0.25mg strength and red and yellow iron oxides for the 2 mg strength), polyvinyl alcohol, talc, titanium dioxide, xanthan gum.</p><p>The placebo tablets used in the studies described in this NDA have the same composition and configuration as the 0.25 mg and 2 mg drug products but do not contain siponimod.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions on the Substantial Evidence of Effectiveness</head><p>A single randomized, placebo-controlled trial (CBAF312A2304) performed in subjects deemed to have secondary progression multiple sclerosis (SPMS) meets its prespecified primary endpoint, time to 3-month confirmed disability progression (CDP) on the EDSS, and thus is a positive study. Despite that, it is very concerning that this study failed to meet its first "key" secondary endpoint, time to 3-month confirmed 20% worsening on the Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25FW), since the median EDSS of the population was 6.0, a value at which ambulatory dysfunction is the primary determinant of the EDSS. This reviewer also has concerns about the conduct of the study because attestations that subjects had SPMS were not collected, adjudication of subjects not having clinical documentation of EDSS progression in the prior two years did not consistently occur before randomization, and a "dual database access issue" may have resulted in the unblinding of 101 subjects and affected the outcome of the trial. Although CBAF312A2304 met its primary endpoint, the treatment effect was relatively modest (relative risk reduction of 21.2%, p=0.013), and the statistical strength of the effect is arguably insufficient for a single trial to support an indication of SPMS, especially given the aforementioned concerns.</p><p>Further analysis suggests that siponimod's treatment effect on 3-month CDP is driven by the subsets of subjects who experienced relapses in the 2 years prior to randomization, demonstrated gadolinium-enhancing lesions on a baseline MRI, or had an overall disease duration of less than 10 years. This suggests that siponimod has a greater treatment effect on Reference ID: 4409592</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(b) (4) (b)<label>(4)</label></formula><p>(b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(4)</ref> Clinical Review David E.

Although this raises questions about the interpretability of subsequent endpoints, siponimod achieves large effect sizes with very low nominal p-values on multiple MRI metrics. Annualized relapse rate (ARR) is a "non-key" secondary endpoint and is not included in the hierarchical analysis of CBAF312A2304. Despite that and the observation that only a small percentage (13.1%) of subjects in CBAF312A2304 experienced confirmed MS relapses, the ARR result is nominally highly statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001), supporting a potential role of siponimod in relapsing MS, especially given its robust effect on MRI outcomes. CBAF312A2201 is a Phase 2, two-tiered, six-armed, dose-finding study in subjects with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) that utilizes dose-response on an MRI metric, combined unique active lesions (CUAL), as its primary endpoint. Although CBAF312A2201 was not powered to show an effect on ARR, it narrowly achieves a nominally statistically significant treatment effect on relapses (p=0.0408) at the 2 mg dose; however, the 0.5 and 10 mg arms of this study do not achieve nominal statistical significance. The results of CBAF312A2201 may also support role for siponimod in relapsing MS.</p><p>This reviewer has concerns about whether this circuitous route (including relaxing a hierarchical analysis, relying on secondary endpoints from a large SPMS trial and a small dose-finding study in RRMS, and minimizing concerns regarding the conduct of the Phase 3 study) provides substantial evidence of effectiveness to support approval of siponimod with an indication of relapsing forms of MS for siponimod. It is reassuring that many drugs that have a modulatory or suppressive effect on the immune system have been shown to have a benefit in relapsing MS, including a related S1P receptor modulator (fingolimod) that is approved for relapsing forms of MS. Considering this more global view of MS therapeutics convinces this reviewer that there is just enough evidence to be considered substantial and to support siponimod's approval with an indication of relapsing forms of MS.</p><p>The pathophysiology of MS consists of a clear inflammatory component (i.e., disease relapses and new MRI lesions) and another component that is termed "degenerative" (i.e., disease progression) but is poorly understood. Overall, it appears that MS becomes less "inflammatory" and more "degenerative" over time; however, both processes can contribute to increasing disability. Worsening disability from "inflammatory" disease is due to incomplete recovery from inflammatory events; conversely, disability progression from "degenerative" disease is insidious but of unclear etiology. With current metrics, distinguishing disability progression due to "degeneration" from disability worsening from "inflammation" is very</p><p>The pathophysiology of progressive MS is not understood but appears to differ from the inflammatory aspect of the disease that is prominent in relapsing MS. Despite this, many of the trials for progressive MS have utilized agents that have shown efficacy in relapsing MS, but unfortunately, most of these trials failed to achieve their primary endpoint. Although some have attributed these failures to inadequate outcomes measures (EDSS) or study duration, this reviewer agrees that the issues with trials for progressive MS also involve a difference in disease pathology and the difficulty in disentangling worsening disability from relapses from disease progression.</p><p>Because there is not a biomarker for SPMS and because MS represents a continuum in which 2 processes, "inflammation" Approximately 85% of people diagnosed with MS initially have relapsing remitting MS (RRMS), which is an active inflammatory process characterized by relapses and the development of new MRI lesions, some of which lead to worsening disability.</p><p>Over time, many people with RRMS will exhibit a slow progression of disability that appears independent of inflammatory disease, heralding a transition to secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Although it is less common than in RRMS, active inflammatory disease can occur in SPMS (relapsing SPMS) but eventually relapses become rare as the disease transitions to non-relapsing SPMS. In relapsing SPMS, it is hard to disentangle worsening disability due to relapses from disability progression due to the "degenerative" process in SPMS.</p><p>and "degeneration," occur simultaneously, it is very difficult to adequately define a population of SPMS, especially relapsing SPMS, for a clinical trial. Issues to consider when attempting to do so include specifying the amount of time without relapses before the study, the period of time over which disability must increase during the study, and an algorithm to accurately disentangle disability worsening due to relapses from disability progression due to "degeneration." Other issues to consider when designing SPMS trials include the effect of previously (or currently) used MS drugs, the sensitivity of the disability scale to change at the level of disability of the population, and the necessary duration of the trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current Treatment Options</head><p>There are over a dozen agents approved for relapsing forms of MS. Data for these agents strongly suggest that they reduce both relapse rates and MRI activity; however, the efficacy of some of these agents in reducing disability progression at 12 or 24 weeks is questionable given less robust results and conflicting results among trials.</p><p>There are multiple agents approved to reduce the "inflammatory" component of the disease (relapses, new MRI lesions), but the development of an agent to alter the slow progression that occurs independent of inflammatory events ("progressive disease") remains a significant area of unmet need.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit</head><p>In CBAF312A2304, siponimod achieved an absolute risk reduction in 3-month CDP of almost 5.5% over placebo, giving a number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one 3-month CDP event over 18 months of approximately <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">19</ref>. This treatment effect was driven by siponimod's effect on a subset of patients with relapses and inflammatory disease. It is not clear that the CBAF312A2304 population had SPMS, because investigator attestations of SPMS were not collected, adjudication of 2-year disability progression was not consistently performed before randomization, and the Kaplan-Meier analyses suggest that almost 70% of subjects would not accrue 6-month confirmed disability progression in 3 years. In addition to reducing new MRI activity, siponimod has a positive treatment effect on ARR: in CBAF312A2304, Regardless of whether the subject population actually had SPMS, CBAF312A2304 does not support a benefit of siponimod in a population with predominantly progressive disease, e.g., non-relapsing SPMS, because siponimod's treatment effect on 3-month confirmed disability progression appears to be much greater for reducing worsening disability (from relapses and new MRI lesions) than for reducing disability progression (independent of inflammatory activity).</p><p>Siponimod's effect on relapses and MRI metrics suggest that it may offer a benefit to people with relapsing MS, although it should be noted that only 13.1% of subjects in CBAF312A2304 experienced a relapse, that only the 2mg arm of CBAF312A2201 achieved nominal statistical significance on its ARR endpoint, that ARR was a secondary endpoint in both trials, and that MRI is not a measure of how a subject </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Condition</head><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) that likely occurs when a genetically susceptible individual is exposed to an environmental trigger. MS is one of the most common causes of non-traumatic neurologic disability in young adults, and recent estimates suggest that almost one million people in the Unites States have this disease; therefore, the economic impact of MS (estimated at $10 billion annually in the US in 2013) is huge <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Reich et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">, Wallin et al., 2019</ref>. The International MS Genetics Consortium (IMSGC) has identified over 200 genetic loci that contribute to the risk of developing MS, and most of these genes are associated with the function of the immune system. The environmental triggers for MS are less well defined, although vitamin D deficiency and later exposure to the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) are considered to be risk factors for MS. The pathophysiology of MS includes a well-described inflammatory (or immune-mediated) component, which seems predominant earlier in the disease, and what is termed a "degenerative" component, which is less well understood but is felt to predominate later in the disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Compston and Coles, 2008)</ref>. The currently recognized clinical phenotypes of the disease include relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS); the modifier "active" can be used to indicate relapses or MRI activity, and the modifier "progression" can be used to indicate disability progression not attributable to relapses. Conversely, the term "worsening" should be reserved for disability progression attributable to relapses .</p><p>About 85% of people who develop MS begin with RRMS, with an average age of diagnosis of approximately 30 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Weinshenker et al., 1989)</ref>. RRMS is characterized by recurrent inflammatory episodes, termed "relapses," in which auto-reactive lymphocytes marginate across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and enter the CNS, leading to acute injury to myelin, oligodendrocytes, and axons, and potentially causing new or worsening neurologic deficits. Potential targets of acute inflammatory injury include the subcortical white matter, brainstem, optic nerve, and spinal cord; however, recent data suggests that the grey matter and neurons can also be a target of this inflammatory attack and that these cortical lesions may correlate better with disability <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Compston and Coles, 2008)</ref>. The diagnostic criteria for RRMS require clinical or imaging evidence of dissemination of clinical events "in time and space," meaning that a patient must experience at least two clinically or radiologically distinct episodes to be diagnosed with RRMS . Although early relapses may be followed by complete recovery, over time, relapses are associated with an accumulation of residual deficits and increasing disability <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Confavreux et al., 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Weinshenker et al., 1989</ref>). <ref type="bibr">Reference ID: 4409592</ref> Clinical Review David E.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>for all NDAs and BLAs</head><p>Over time (on average, ~15 years after the diagnosis of RRMS), a slow, insidious progression of disability--that appears to be independent of the occurrence of relapses--is seen in many patients with RRMS <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Weinshenker et al., 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Confavreux et al., 2000</ref>. This phase of the disease is termed SPMS, and the progression of disability in this phase is felt to be driven by the poorly understood "degenerative" aspect of the disease. Given the nature of this progression, a diagnosis of SPMS is made retrospectively. Hypotheses regarding the pathophysiology of this "degenerative process" in SPMS include a bioenergetic deficit from mitochondrial dysfunction, compartmentalized inflammation behind an intact blood-brain barrier, increased free radicals, or simply "neurodegeneration." Relapses and new MRI lesions can still occur in SPMS but are less frequent, especially later in this phase of the disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Correale et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>About 15% of people with MS have PPMS, in which patients accumulate disability from the onset of the disease, typically with few if any relapses <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Weinshenker et al., 1989)</ref>. Like SPMS, it is also felt to be driven by more of a "degenerative process"; interestingly, the typical age of onset (mid-40's) of SPMS and PPMS is similar <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Mahad et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Antel et al., 2012</ref>. "Progressive Relapsing" MS (PRMS) refers to PPMS with occasional relapses, although this phenotype was removed from the most current phenotypic classification of MS and is now referred to as PPMS "with activity" .</p><p>Two meta-analyses of clinical trials in relapsing MS <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Sormani et al, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sormani and Bruzzi, 2013)</ref> suggest that the development of new MRI lesions may be a surrogate for relapses, so siponimod's robust effect on disease activity on MRI supports the effect of siponimod in reducing relapses. A similar meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Sormani et al, 2010)</ref> suggests that the correlation between new MRI activity and disability worsening on EDSS was significantly weaker, perhaps explaining the discordant results in the trials of siponimod (and several other RMS therapies including fingolimod) between disability metrics and inflammatory activity, as measured by MRI activity and relapses. It is well established that there is not a good correlation between the burden of MRI disease and current disability, a phenomenon referred to as the "clinicoradiological paradox" <ref type="bibr">(Barkhof 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is not a biomarker for SPMS. Further, the transition from a primarily inflammatory disease (RRMS) to a predominantly "degenerative" disease (SPMS) likely occurs over a long period of time, during which both processes likely make a significant contribution to the pathophysiology of the disease in parallel <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Katz-Sand et al, 2014)</ref>. Recognition of this is illustrated by the use of terms such as "relapsing SPMS," "non-relapsing SPMS," and "transitional MS," and with the addition of the "with activity" and "with progression" modifiers to the updated description of the MS phenotypes . During the transitional stage of the disease, having an effect on either the inflammatory or the "degenerative" phase of the disease is likely to slow the progression of disability from the disease (See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1)</ref>.  Although it remains unclear whether SPMS is an evolutionary outcome of the chronic inflammation caused by relapsing MS or is a separate pathological neurodegenerative process <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Scott, 2017)</ref>, effective prevention of relapses does not translate into prevention of disability in progressive MS <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(D'Amico et al., 2016)</ref>. Although disability can result from residual deficits following relapses <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Lublin et al., 2003)</ref>, relapses are not the dominant factor resulting in severe and permanent disability in SPMS (Paz <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Soldan et al., 2015)</ref>. Relapses are associated with a mean increase of 0.75 on the EDSS scale; however, in most patients, the disability incurred at the onset of a relapse improves significantly within two to three months <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Lublin et al., 2003)</ref>. Relapse-related EDSS increases that meet generally accepted criteria for confirmed progression of disability for three or six months are typically not sustained when patients are examined one or two years later <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Liu et al., 2000)</ref>; however, clinical trials in MS do not typically follow patients for sufficient duration to note this recovery <ref type="bibr">(Wingerchuk &amp; Weinshenker, 2016)</ref>. It is therefore evident that damage from relapses alone cannot account for the timing and the quantity of permanent disability in SPMS, and that any clinical investigation of disability in SPMS must disentangle ephemeral disability due to relapses from disability due to the progressive disease.</p><p>The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1962 (FD&amp;C) requires that drug manufacturers "demonstrate the effectiveness of their products through the conduct of adequate and wellcontrolled studies" to obtain marketing approval for a drug. Generally, this has been interpreted as a requirement for "at least 2 adequate and well controlled studies," although on occasion, "a single multicenter study of excellent design" that provides "highly reliable and statistically strong evidence of an important clinical benefit" have been accepted, especially after the FD&amp;C was amended by the FDA Modernization Act of 1997. Further, clinical Clinical Review David E. Jones, MD NDA 209884 <ref type="bibr">Mayzent (siponimod)</ref> CDER Clinical Review Template 23 Version date: <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">September 6, 2017</ref> for all NDAs and BLAs endpoints, especially those that measure how a person "feels, functions, or survives," are preferable to surrogate markers of effect, which generally require post-marketing confirmatory studies. For these reasons, FDA gives more weight to relapses and disability progression (as measured by EDSS) endpoints than to MRI measures in MS clinical trials, especially given the relatively weak correlation between MRI and disability and the aforementioned "clinicoradiologic paradox."</p><p>The terms "relapsing MS" (RMS) or "relapsing forms of MS" include individuals with RRMS and relapsing SPMS. There are currently over a dozen approved medications that are indicated for relapsing forms of MS; however, non-relapsing SPMS is a significant unmet need in the therapeutic armamentarium for MS. Distinguishing relapsing from non-relapsing SPMS can be difficult, especially in individuals who are already taking one of the approved medications for RMS because any medication with efficacy in preventing relapses could be contributing real, but unmeasurable, benefit to patients by preventing new relapses and relapse-related disability.</p><p>Therapies approved for RMS with demonstrable reductions in relapse rates have not proven effective for SPMS. There have been randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with interferon beta-1a <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Li et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Andersen et al., 2004)</ref> and natalizumab <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kapoor et al., 2018)</ref> that show no reduction of disability progression in SPMS. A trial of interferon beta-1b by the European Study Group demonstrated a benefit on 3-month confirmed disability progression in SPMS, but the studied population appears to have an earlier, relapsing SPMS or "transitional MS." Conversely, an analogous North American study in an SPMS population did not demonstrate a benefit of interferon beta-1b on 6-month confirmed disability progression, although the population "may have tended toward the less inflammatory" <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Panitch et al., 2004)</ref>. Other clinical trials of plausible therapies for SPMS including pooled immunoglobulins <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hommes et al., 2004)</ref>, a synthetic myelin basic protein sequence called MBP 8298 or dirucotide <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Freedman et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Warren et al., 2006), and</ref><ref type="bibr">-tetrahydrocannabinol (Zajicek et al., 2013)</ref> similarly showed no clinical benefit on disability progression. A clinical trial of mitoxantrone for SPMS demonstrates a significant positive treatment effect on EDSS and ambulation index, although the patient population is also suggestive of relapsing SPMS or "transitional MS" <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hartung et al., 2002)</ref>. The data from this trial served as the basis for the approval of mitoxantrone for the indications of "reducing neurologic disability and/or the frequency of clinical relapses in patients with secondary (chronic) progressive, progressive relapsing, and worsening relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis" in October of 2000.</p><p>Similar to the experience with SPMS, several randomized clinical trials for PPMS showed no overall benefit, including ones with glatiramer acetate <ref type="bibr">(Wolinsky et al., 2007)</ref>, rituximab <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hawker et al., 2009)</ref>, and fingolimod <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Lublin et al., 2016)</ref>. A post-hoc analysis of the glatiramer acetate trial suggests a benefit of this drug in men with PPMS, and a subgroup analysis of the rituximab study suggested efficacy in a younger, more inflammatory population.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Current Treatment Options</head><p>As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 2</ref>, there are over a dozen MS drugs that are approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, an indication that includes relapsing-remitting MS and relapsing SPMS, based on their effects on relapses and supported by their effect on MRI metrics. Many of these MS drugs do not have consistently positive data regarding disability progression; indeed, two of the three Phase 3 RRMS trials of a medication (fingolimod) in the same pharmacologic class as siponimod did not meet their disability endpoint. Although not supported by strong data, many providers will continue using one of these medications after subjects have transitioned from RMS to non-relapsing SPMS; however, the distinction between RMS and non-relapsing SPMS is admittedly very challenging, especially in individuals who are being treated with an MS drug. NOVANTRONE (mitoxantrone) is the only approved therapy indicated for the treatment of SPMS. The major safety concerns with mitoxantrone are cardiotoxicity and secondary leukemia, especially acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The lifetime maximum dose of mitoxantrone is 140mg/m 2 , often limiting the duration of treatment with this medication to less than 3 years. OCREVUS (ocrelizumab), a monoclonal antibody directed against CD20, is the only approved therapy for Primary Progressive MS. Ocrelizumab is also approved for relapsing forms of MS, but there are no data to support its use in non-relapsing SPMS. The most significant safety concerns associated with ocrelizumab are infusion reactions, infections, and a possible increased risk of malignancy, especially breast cancer. Although off-label, some providers use intermittent high dose steroids, often monthly pulses of methylprednisolone, to treat SPMS. Effective treatments for non-relapsing SPMS that reduce long-term disability progression remain areas of significant unmet medical need.

Blinding Study A2304 employed a double-blind design. Subjects, investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, and the sponsor were to remain blinded to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until the database lock for the Core Part of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Sources of Clinical Data and Review Strategy</head><p>To prevent unblinding during the double-blind treatment period, the Sponsor implemented the following procedures: Randomization data were kept strictly confidential until the time of the database lock and were not accessible by anyone else involved in the study with the following exceptions:</p><p>o DMC members, Independent Statisticians, and Independent Programmers o PK analysts had access to the randomization codes associated with patients from whom PK samples were taken but PK results remained confidential until database lock.</p><p>Per the CSR, "The identity of the treatments was concealed by the use of study drugs that were identical in packaging, labeling, schedule of administration, appearance, taste, and odor." EDSS assessments were conducted by independent raters. EDSS assessments occurred per protocol every 3 months and in the case of a suspected MS relapse. The independent rater had access to prior EDSS scores for comparison.</p><p>Two separate databases were set-up for the main clinical data and the first dose administration data because the dose initiation data may provide a viewer with clinical data that could reveal treatment assignment.</p><p>Subjects received the first dose of study treatment under the supervision of an independent First-Dose Administrator who would not reveal the results of the monitoring to the patient or to anyone else associated with the clinical study unless there was medical justification for such notice. Adverse events associated with first dose such as bradycardia and AV block were recorded but not revealed to the study team except when necessary to ensure subject safety.</p><p>There were restrictions on reporting of certain hematology results during blinded treatment because reduced lymphocyte counts were expected, given the mechanism of action for siponimod. Specifically, after the baseline visit, only the absolute counts for eosinophils, basophils and monocytes were communicated to sites by the central laboratory. The absolute total white blood cell, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were measured at each visit by the central laboratory (and were blinded from the sponsor and the investigator) and were only communicated to the site in case of a notable abnormality that could have required a dose change.</p><p>Unblinding was permitted in the case of patient emergencies and at the conclusion of the Core Part of the study.</p><p>Reviewer comment: The planned procedures to maintain blinding seem reasonable and appropriate, especially the utilization of First Dose Administrators and a separate First o Attestation by the investigator in a written statement that the disease had entered the progressive stage (according to the study definition) at least 6 months prior to enrollment Disability status at Screening with an EDSS score of 3.0 to 6.5 (inclusive) Should documented EDSS scores not be available, a written summary of the clinical evidence of disability progression in the previous 2 years, and retrospective assessment of EDSS score from data up to 2 years prior to screening had to be submitted for central review.</p><p>Note: A central review of the available clinical evidence of disability progression was required for patients without documented pre-trial EDSS assessments. This was completed by submitting a disability progression form for central adjudication. The central adjudication was led by Clinical Review David E.

The clinical distinction between RRMS and SPMS is difficult, especially because relapses can occur in SPMS, worsening of disability can occur in RRMS; furthermore, there is an unknown period of time (estimated to be 2.9 years by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Katz-Sand et al., 2014)</ref> in which the disease transitions from RRMS to SPMS. The distinction between RRMS and SPMS may be even more difficult in potential subjects who are taking a medication for MS.</p><p>To distinguish siponimod's effect on disability progression from its effect on disability worsening attributable to relapses (and to have a better chance of selecting a population of non-relapsing SPMS), it would have been ideal to stipulate a lack of evidence of relapses for 36 months, although at least <ref type="bibr">12 (or preferably 24)</ref> months may be more realistic from a clinical trial design point of view It is recognized that there is not an accepted period of time without relapses that defines non-relapsing SPMS, even in patients who are not taking an approved therapy for relapsing <ref type="bibr">MS.</ref> In clinical practice, the criterion for SPMS is often "in the eye of the beholder." In Study A2304, this clinical judgment was represented partially by the inclusion criterion stipulating the necessity of written attestation by the investigator that the subject had entered the "progressive phase" of the disease, as defined by at least 6 months of a progressive disability increase. With that said, OSI's inspections could not locate these attestations at several sites. On <ref type="bibr">January 18, 2019</ref>, the sponsor noted in a response to an Information Request that "a specific attestation form for inclusion criterion 4 was not implemented for collection centrally as part of the study protocol," but "believes that the standard documentation practice for this and other eligibility criteria were appropriate." Because of the clinical judgement required to make a diagnosis of SPMS, the fact that these attestations were not collected and thus were not available for review erodes confidence in the claim that the subjects in the study population actually had SPMS, especially as the Kaplan-Meier analyses suggests that over 70% of subjects (even those randomized to placebo) would not experience  in the study.</p><p>Subjects also needed to have clinical documentation of EDSS progression in the 2 years prior to the study, although this also was not collected. If this clinical documentation did not exist in the medical record, a written summary of the evidence supporting disability progression over the prior 2 years was to be submitted to for adjudication; however, OSI found that some of these summaries were not submitted for <ref type="bibr">Reference ID: 4409592 (b)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(4)</ref> (b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(4)</ref> (b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(4)</ref> Clinical Review David E.

For more information on the safety of siponimod, refer to the safety review by Dr. Paul Lee.</p><p>The short "washout" for many of the preceding MS drugs (that reduce relapses and new MRI lesions) may mask ongoing inflammatory disease activity and lead to misclassification of late RRMS subjects as having non-relapsing SPMS, thus potentially enriching the study population with subjects with late RRMS and relapsing SPMS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rationale for dose selection</head><p>The siponimod 2 mg dose used in CBAF312A2304 was chosen based on the results of CBAF312A2201, a Phase 2 dose-finding study of siponimod in subjects with RRMS that investigated the safety and efficacy of doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg. The primary outcome measure of CBAF312A2201 was the dose-response relationship among five doses of BAF312 and placebo during 3 months of treatment in patients with RRMS, as measured by the number of combined unique active [MRI] lesions (CUAL). To analyze dose-response, the investigators used the multiple comparison procedures with modeling (MCP-mod) statistical technique. Treatment with siponimod 10 mg reduced CUAL by over 80% compared with placebo. The 2 mg dose of siponimod had a similar response on this MRI endpoint, whereas the 0.5 mg dose level showed less evidence of efficacy (reduction of approximately 50% CUAL vs. placebo). Lymphoid sequestration of lymphocytes with siponimod followed a similar dose-response curve. The annualized relapse rate (ARR) was nominally significantly lower with siponimod 2 mg vs. placebo: 0.20 vs. 0.58 (p=0.044). For 0.5 mg, there was no apparent treatment effect on relapses (ARR 0.61), nor was there greater efficacy on relapses seen at the 10 mg dose (ARR 0.30); hence, 2 mg appears to be the optimal treatment dose for the CBAF312A2304 study.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The choice of selecting the 2 mg dose for CBAF312A2304 seems reasonable. It is notable that the 2 mg dose of siponimod in CBAF312A2201 had a statistically significant effect on relapses but the 0.5 and 10 mg doses did not; however, the relevance of these observations may be low as the study arms were not powered to demonstrate an effect on relapses. As described above, to preserve blinding of treatment status, the initial dose of study treatment was administered by an independent First Dose Administrator. The First Dose Administrator monitored cardiovascular and pulmonary status and would not divulge findings to patients, the study staff, or the sponsor unless there was a significant medical need to do so.</p><p>The dose titration that was introduced in CBAF312A2201 due to the occurrence of bradyarrhythmic events was also used in CBAF312A2304 because this initial-dose titration scheme appeared to reduce the frequency of symptomatic bradyarrhythmic events and asymptomatic atrioventicular-blocks in CBAF312A2201. Patients started treatment in the Core Part with a 6-day titration regimen of siponimod or matching placebo by the schedule outlined in the <ref type="table" target="#tab_19">Table 5</ref> below. Missing a dose of study medication during the titration or missing four or more days of study medication after the titration necessitated a re-titration. Based on prior experience with siponimod (and other S1P agents), higher grade lymphopenia was expected to occur in &lt;10% of patients at the 2 mg/day dose. To potentially reduce the need for treatment interruptions, which would have had a negative impact on the treatment effect, the protocol allowed subjects with lymphocyte counts &lt;0.2 x10 9 /L at 2 consecutive visits on the 2 mg/day dose level to switch to 1 mg/day, albeit in a blinded fashion.</p><p>Siponimod (0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg) and dose-matched placebo were provided as film-coated tablets that were identical in appearance. Study drug for titration was packaged in blister cards that were dispensed for initial titration and re-titration. Study drug to be used for maintenance dosing was supplied in bottles containing fifty-five tablets (1 mg, 2 mg, or placebo). Reviewer Comment: Even though siponimod is deemed to selectively modulate S1P-1 and S1P-5, some subjects developed bradyarrhythmias after starting siponimod, thereby necessitating a 6-day dose titration and initial cardiac monitoring, particularly in at risk subjects. Presumably, this suggests that the modulation of S1P-1 plays more of a role in cardiac dysrhythmias than initially thought and may make the initiation of siponimod somewhat more cumbersome than fingolimod, a non-selective S1P agent.</p><p>The attempt to make the appearance of the siponimod and placebo tablets identical is appreciated, as this was an important step in maintaining the integrity of study blinding.</p></div>

ECM also included mobile cardiac telemetry (or a Holter monitor) until study day #7, on which an EKG was done 3 and 6 hours after that day's dose of study medication. ECM was initially performed in all subjects; however, amendment 1 altered the protocol so ECM was only necessary in subjects who met certain criteria (Expanded Cardiac Monitoring group).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary Efficacy Endpoint</head><p>The primary endpoint of this study was the time to 3-month confirmed disability progression (CDP) as measured by the EDSS in subjects with SPMS. The study defined 3-month disability progression as a 1.0-point increase in EDSS from baseline for subjects with an EDSS between 3.0 and 5.0 (or 0.5-point increase for subjects with an EDSS of 5.5 -6.5) that persisted until a scheduled visit 3 months after the initial disability progression (DP). Although disability progression could begin with a relapse, the confirmatory 3-month EDSS could not be done during an MS relapse; however, one could question how long a relapse lasts and whether recovery from some relapses can take over 3 months.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: This is a time to event analysis.

Its value is the average of two 25-foot walk trials (timed in seconds), and a difference of 20% or more is deemed to be clinically significant. The T25FW was assessed every 3 months in the core part of this study.</p><p>The second "key" secondary endpoint in the prespecified hierarchical analysis is change from baseline in T2 lesion volume.

These scans included T1-weighted images (with and without gadolinium) and T2-weighted proton density and FLAIR sequences. A local neuro-radiologist reviewed the study for pathology that was not related to MS. A blinded centralized reading center assessed the quality of the scans and analyzed the MRI per prespecified protocols.

Study subjects were instructed to notify the treating neurologist of new symptoms potentially meeting this definition and to be evaluated and treated, ideally within 7 days of the onset of these symptoms. If this assessment suggested that the symptoms may represent a relapse, a blinded EDSS was performed by the evaluating neurologist to confirm the relapse. Relapse confirmation required an increase of at least 0.5 points from the previous (nonrelapse) EDSS or an increase of 1 point on two (or 2 points on one) EDSS functional system(s), excluding changes in the bowel/bladder and cerebral functional systems. ARR was calculated for each subject as the number of relapses X 365.25 (days/year) ÷ time on study (days).</p><p>Reviewer Comment: These additional secondary endpoints seem reasonable. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Endpoints</head><p>CBAF312A2304 is a time to event trial. It utilizes a hierarchical analysis for its primary and two secondary endpoints that were classified as "key."</p><p>The primary endpoint is the time to 3-month confirmed disability progression (CDP), expressed as a hazard ratio and analyzed by a Cox proportional hazards model with treatment, country, baseline EDSS, and SPMS subgroup (subjects with or without superimposed relapses) as covariates. Kaplan-Meier curves and log rank tests were also performed. Data were not imputed for subjects who discontinued the study after a disability event but before 3-month confirmation of that event, although a sensitivity analysis was performed in which it was assumed that these subjects would have had 3-month CDP. Subjects who did not experience a 3-month CDP event during the study were censored on the date of the last EDSS assessment.</p><p>The first "key" secondary endpoint was time to 20% worsening on the Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25FW) test. Analysis of this "key" secondary endpoint also utilized a Cox proportional hazards model with treatment, country, baseline EDSS, and SPMS subgroup as covariates.</p><p>The second "key" secondary endpoint was an MRI endpoint, namely the change in T2 lesion volume from baseline. Analysis of this "key" secondary endpoint used a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with visit as a categorical variable and an unstructured covariance matrix.</p><p>Other secondary endpoints were assessed with an alpha = 0.05 significance level. There was no correction for multiplicity for these "non-key" secondary endpoints.</p></div>

Assuming a 2-year proportion with disability progression of 0.30 in the placebo group, a 2-year drop-out rate of 20%, and an enrollment rate of 100 patients per month, 1530 patients and an overall study duration of approximately 42 months were required to observe at least 374 patients with disability progression, which would give the required power. In this calculation, exponential distribution assumptions were used for the event and drop-out rates.</p><p>The protocol was amended to update the criterion for stopping the Core Part of the study from 374 patients with 3-month CDP had been observed (original plan) to approximately 3 years after randomization of the first patient and at least 374 events observed. At approximately 3 years, it was expected that more than 374 patients with 3-month CDP had been observed. This was expected to compensate for the slight power loss due to the alpha adjustment for the interim analysis and a power of at least 90% was expected at the end of the Core Part."</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Compliance with Good Clinical Practices</head><p>In Section 5.2 ("Ethical conduct of the study"), the sponsor states "this clinical study was designed, implemented, and reported in accordance with the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, with applicable local regulations (including European Directive 2001/20/EC, US Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, and Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare), and with the ethical principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki." The study protocol and the 4 amendments were to be approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) at each site before study initiation. An informed consent document (ICD) was to be completed for each subject before that subject engaged in any study procedures. Subject reconsent was required for subjects who experienced 6-month disability progression, a severe relapse, or 2 confirmed MS relapses. Consents were also required from subjects entering the extension study, participating in the pharmacogenetic component, or agreeing to a sub-study.</p><p>The CSR also states, "audits were conducted to assess GCP compliance with global and local regulatory requirements, protocols and internal SOPs <ref type="bibr">[Standard Operating Procedures]</ref>, and are performed according to written QA [Quality Assurance] SOPs."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Financial Disclosure</head><p>Module 1, Section 1.3.4 of the NDA includes information regarding financial certification and disclosure. This section includes Form FDA 3454 indicating there were no financial arrangements with the clinical investigators whereby the value of compensation to the investigator could be affected by the outcome of the study as defined in 21 CFR54.2(a). A list of investigators with any financial interest in the outcome of the study is included in this section of the NDA: almost all disclosures were "significant payments of other sorts," although one investigator disclosed that his wife is an employee of Novartis and holds stock options below $50,000.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient Disposition</head><p>First consisted of all randomized subjects who received one or more doses of the study medication. Five subjects were randomized to siponimod but not treated, and one subject did not provide informed consent; therefore, the ITT population or Full Analysis Set (FAS) included 1645 subjects. The disposition of subjects is summarized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>. More subjects remained on the study treatment assigned at randomization during the treatment epoch in the siponimod (66.7%) arm compared with the placebo (59.0%) arm. Of those who prematurely discontinued the assigned study treatment, many (32.0% in the siponimod arm, 42.0% in the placebo arm) transitioned to open label siponimod, which was allowed after a subject experienced 6-month CDP. Some of the others who stopped the assigned study treatment (37.2% in the siponimod arm, 25.4% in the placebo arm) continued to be followed in an abbreviated visit schedule, in which they did not take study medication but could take a commercially available MS medication. 10.1% of subjects randomized to siponimod (and 13.4% of those randomized to placebo) discontinued the Treatment Epoch and the study. Reviewer Comment: The percentage of subjects who completed the treatment epoch on the study treatment assigned at randomization seems quite low, although a significant percentage of these subjects transitioned to open-label siponimod or the abbreviated visit schedule, in which they could take another available MS drug. Despite that caveat, the number of subjects who discontinued the study drug assigned at randomization in CBAF312A2304 is higher than that in other MS clinical trials of comparable scope. These low rates of completion on the study treatment assigned at randomization decreases confidence in the study results. In the FREEDOMS trial of fingolimod , 81% of subjects completed the study on active drug (72% on placebo). Similarly, 74% of subjects in the TEMSO study <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(O'Connor et al, 2011)</ref> completed the study on teriflunomide (71% for placebo). In the studies of dimethyl fumarate <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gold et al, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">, Fox et al, 2012</ref>, the completion rates on active drug (69% for DEFINE, 71% for CONFIRM) and placebo (65% for DEFINE, 64% for CONFIRM) were also higher than those in CBAF312A2304 (67% siponimod, 59% placebo).</p><p>All 5 subjects who were randomized but not exposed to study drug were in the siponimod arm.</p><p>The sponsor disposition analysis states that 81.7% of subjects randomized to siponimod (and 77.7% of subjects randomized to placebo) completed the Treatment Epoch, but this seems independent of the therapy subjects were taking when they completed the Treatment Epoch. With the caveat that the reason given for dropping out of a study may be inaccurate, the most common reasons for discontinuing the Treatment Epoch (per the sponsor's definition) were "Subject / Guardian Decision," "Adverse Event," and "Lack of Efficacy." See <ref type="table" target="#tab_33">Table 9</ref>. Reviewer Comment: Analyzing all subjects who discontinued the study treatment assigned at randomization and trying to identify the precise reason for discontinuing this treatment would have been much more beneficial. Although seemingly common practice, inclusion of "Subject / Guardian Decision" in the list of potential reasons to discontinue the Treatment Epoch lessens the utility of this analysis, especially as it was by far the most common reason for not completing this epoch. Further, subject / guardian decisions may be influenced by physician preference, which may be informed by a spectrum of factors ranging from intuition to unblinding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol Violations/Deviations</head><p>There were 1,951 protocol deviations in 1,028 subjects. The "Selection Criteria Not Met" protocol deviation is of special interest. There were 39 codes (DVSPID) used to stratify this type of deviation, although their free text descriptions suggest significant overlap between these codes. Prohibited concomitant medication had its own category and was a subcategory of selection criteria deviations. With these analytic complications, the most common and relevant protocol deviations in regard to subject selection criteria are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 11</ref>.  <ref type="bibr">2-</ref>year disability progression in subjects who did not have clinical documentation of EDSS progression over this time), it is very concerning that the sponsor did not collect (and thus is unable to provide) the notes of attestation supporting SPMS and that some of the adjudications occurred after randomization. These issues raise serious questions about whether the study population in this single trial supporting an indication of SPMS actually had SPMS.</p><p>Because a reduction in heart rate after the first dose of siponimod could negatively affect study blinding, an independent team performed the first dose observations, and the "First Dose" database was separate from the "Main" study database. Before the database lock of the Core Part of the Study, it was learned that study personnel at 48 sites were inadvertently granted access to both databases (dual database access). Affected subjects were assigned a GCP01 ("Not following per protocol blinding procedures but integrity of the study is not compromised (Dual database access") protocol deviation. After initial submission of the NDA, the sponsor learned of more study personnel with dual database access, so an amendment to the NDA was submitted on 7/26/2018. This amendment updated the numbers of dual database access PDs and divided them into GCP01 (dual database access by the primary team) and GCP10 (dual database access by the first dose team). See <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 12</ref>. In addition, the following text was struck out in the CSR amendment: "In the electronic audit trail maintained for these systems there was no evidence of site staff accessing/ modifying the 'incorrect' database." Because of this, an IR was sent to the sponsor inquiring why this text was deleted: the sponsor's response states that inappropriate modifications by "First Dose" users were made to the "Main" database in 11 subjects, 9 of whom were randomized. Users of the "Main" database modified data in the "First Dose" database for 10 patients. This IR also requested a copy of the database audit logs; however, the sponsor stated that an audit log of database access was no longer available but that an audit log for database modifications was available and allowed the inappropriate data modification analysis. An audit trail of the 1082 inappropriate edits (by 5 users) to the "Main" database was provided as an Excel spreadsheet. Further exploration (and OSI's inspection of the sponsor) revealed that eighty-two sites in the CBAF312A2304 study experienced issues with "dual database access" in which 32 users of the Reviewer Comment: This "Dual Database Access" issue is very concerning. Although inappropriate data modifications seem to have made in only a few instances, the possibility that an investigator could access the database to determine treatment assignment raises concerns about the integrity of treatment blinding at the affected sites. The reported lack of a user access audit trail does not allow analysis of the scope of potential unblinding caused by this dual database access issue or provide assurance that this issue did not influence study data or outcomes.</p><p>Although the sponsor provided a sensitivity analysis suggesting that the results of the Timed 25-foot walk were not affected by this dual database access issue, this is not very reassuring, as multiple other clinical considerations besides the T25FW measurement, up to recommending that a subject discontinue the trial, can be influenced by the degradation of the study blind. For the same reason, the analyses (annualized relapse rate, symbol digit modality test, and MRI metrics in the subset of subjects affected by the dual database access issue) included in the "impact analysis" received on 1/15/2019 do not negate the unblinding concerns raised by the dual database access issue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table of Demographic Characteristics</head><p>The treatment groups appear balanced for baseline key demographic characteristics. Approximately 60% of the subjects are women, which is typical for MS (either RRMS or SPMS) trials. Because SPMS is typically thought to occur about 15 years after RRMS is diagnosed, which is commonly around age 30, the population's median age of 49 years is consistent with SPMS, albeit early SPMS because MS only reduces one's lifespan by an average of 7 years compared with the general population . Over 90% of the subjects are Caucasian. Less than 10% of the subjects are from the US. See <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 13</ref>.  Reviewer Comment: The groups appear relatively well matched. The mean number of years since diagnosis <ref type="bibr">(12.9</ref> years in the siponimod arm, 12.1 years in the placebo arm) suggests a population of subjects with late relapsing-remitting or early SPMS. A significant number of subjects in this trial exhibited clinical evidence of an inflammatory phenotype (relapsing disease), because over 1/3 of subjects had a relapse in the two years before the trial, and almost 25% of subjects had a gadolinium-enhancing lesion at baseline. This seems somewhat higher than expected for an SPMS population, because relapses and MRI activity are thought to be less common in this stage of the disease. Further, almost 80% of subjects had been on a previous MS medication, which may alter the degree of observable inflammatory disease in some subjects, depending on the prior MS drug and the time between cessation of that agent and entry into CBAF312A2304. It is reassuring the rates of the use of dalfampridine are balanced in this study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment Adherence</head><p>A response to an IR regarding treatment adherence to the initially assigned study treatment was received from the sponsor on 9/14/18 and included a dataset entitled "ADHQEXP." <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table  16</ref> suggests good adherence to the study treatment. Reviewer Comment: Treatment adherence to the assigned study medication seemed very high, at least until subjects transitioned to another medication. 27 subjects in the siponimod arm (2%) but only 4 in the placebo arm (&lt;1%) had adherence rates less than 90%. This difference may suggest an issue with tolerance to the study medication, but this reviewer defers this discussion to the safety reviewer. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 17</ref> lists the common concomitant medications used by subjects in the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concomitant Medications</head><p>The analysis on the use of concomitant steroids is complicated by the number of steroid formulations and the potential indications for which steroids can be given. Besides the many non-MS indications for steroids, short courses of steroids can be prescribed to treat an MS relapse and pulse steroids can be used to reduce relapse rates and the progression of MS. It was assumed that topical, intraocular, and epidural steroids are unlikely to be used for MS, so these were excluded from the analysis below. Many of the reported uses of steroids in the study seem to be for an MS relapse, a suspected relapse, or a symptom potentially attributable to a relapse; a few steroids courses were seemingly given for a pseudo-relapse, which   <ref type="bibr">MS, including steroids, vitamin D, fampridine, pregabalin, and gabapentin</ref>. The use of steroids was higher in the placebo group, which may suggest that this group had more relapses and inflammatory disease activity than those randomized to siponimod. Presumably, the relatively high use of ciprofloxacin is attributable to urinary tract infections, which are not uncommon in individuals with MS and were common in CBAF312A2304.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rescue Medication Use</head><p>MS relapses are inflammatory events heralded by the onset of new or worsening neurologic symptoms lasting at least 24 hours and occurring in the absence of fever or infection. Because this definition may be considered somewhat subjective, confirmed relapses are defined as relapses that result in a clinically significant change on the EDSS, i.e., an increase of 0.5 points in the overall EDSS, an increase of 1 point in two functional systems of the EDSS, or an increase of 2 points in one EDSS functional system.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The EDSS is highly dependent on ambulation at scores around 6, so it is very conceivable that some bone fide relapses would not be confirmed because of this characteristic of the scale. Corticosteroids were commonly given to treat a confirmed MS relapse in the study, although a few confirmed relapses were not treated with steroids. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 18</ref> shows the number of confirmed relapses that were treated with steroids in this study.  were to open-label siponimod, the biggest concern would be subjects switching from placebo to siponimod, a switch that would not be expected to increase the risk of a Type I error on these non-CDP endpoints.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time to 3-month Confirmed Disability Progression</head><p>Disability progression was measured by Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), a 10point ordinal scale. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 20</ref> contains descriptive statistics performed by this reviewer to show the change in EDSS from baseline to study completion. Reviewer Comment: With the caveat that the EDSS is often criticized for being a nonlinear scale that is relatively insensitive to change between 4 and 7, the mean change in EDSS from baseline to completion of study drug was quite small, even in the placebo arm of the study. Although there are many potential explanations for this observation, one is that not all of the subjects had progressive disease.</p><p>The primary endpoint of CBAF312A2304 is the difference between siponimod and placebo in the time to 3-month confirmed disability progression (CDP).  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_33">Table 9</ref> in Patient Disposition Section above). This is a potential source of bias (because subjects may stop the assigned study drug after experiencing a DP event but before its 3-month confirmation) that might raise questions about the validity of the study results; however, the sponsor performed several sensitivity analyses to address this issue, and all of these achieved statistical significance. (See <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 25</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>of sensitivity analyses.)</head><p>This reviewer's Kaplan-Meier analysis for this endpoint ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref>) shows that siponimod reduces the time to 3-month CDP in the full analysis set (FAS) with a hazard ratio of 0.79, a 95% CI from 0.65-0.95, and a relative risk reduction 21.2% (p=0.013).  that is not much less than 0.05), the relative risk reduction of 21.2% (and absolute difference of 5.5%) in 3-month CDP seems quite modest, especially given the potential for siponimod's relapse rate reduction to impact the 3-month CDP result, the number of individuals who did not remain on the assigned study drug throughout the Core Part of the study, and the potentially unblinding "dual database access" issue. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 22</ref> demonstrates this reviewer's analysis of the influence of specific baseline characteristics on the time to 3-month CPD. The efficacy of siponimod on this study endpoint seems to be greater in women aged 45 years or less and in subjects with a disease duration of 10 years or less. Because most of the subjects were white (95%), were from outside the US (91%), had an EDSS of 4 (90%), and were in the per protocol set, the apparent benefit of these characteristics is likely driven by power.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary endpoint by subgroups</head><p>The differential benefit of siponimod in subjects who had not previously been on an interferon is difficult to explain but may relate to a difference in disease severity (subjects initially started on a "more aggressive" therapy like natalizumab or mitoxantrone) or a shorter disease duration (in which oral medications were a potential alternative to injectable therapies like the interferons). Reviewer Comment: The apparently differential effect of siponimod in delaying 3-month CDP in younger individuals with a shorter disease duration raises the question of whether siponimod's treatment effect is primarily evident in earlier, more inflammatory disease (i.e., relapsing multiple sclerosis), as occurred in prior positive trials in SPMS, including the MIMS study of mitoxantrone <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hartung et al., 2002)</ref> and the European interferon beta-1b study <ref type="bibr">(1998)</ref>. A similar effect on younger subjects with more inflammatory disease was also seen in the subgroup analysis of rituximab in the OLYMPUS trial of PPMS <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hawker et al., 2009)</ref>. The possibility that this effect on disability is driven by siponimod's effectiveness on earlier, more-inflammatory disease (i.e., relapses and new MRI lesions) will be explored in more detail in the following analyses.</p><p>The SPMS phenotype is typically described as a slow, inexorable worsening of disability with fewer (or the absence of) relapses. The more recent description of the SPMS phenotype  uses the modifier "active" to specify the presence (or absence) of concurrent relapses, although the occurrence of these may be influenced by treatment with an MS drug. With this caveat, this reviewer analyzed the time to 3-month CDP in subjects with and without relapses in the 2 years before the study ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>, respectively) because the lack of relapses in the previous 2 years may better identify subjects with less inflammatory disease.     Reviewer Comment: This reviewer's analysis suggests similar findings to those shown in the pre-study relapses section of the forest plot displaying hazard ratios for 3-month CDP by subgroup ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 11</ref>-5 of the sponsor's Clinical Study Report, replicated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 14</ref> below). In this forest plot, the confidence interval (CI) for the hazard ratio of 3-month CDP crosses 1 for the subgroup without relapses in the prior 2 study, but the CI does not cross 1 (i.e., favors siponimod) in the subgroup with relapses in the 2 years before enrolling in the study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3-month CDP in subset of subjects without relapses in the 2 years before the study</head><p>It is recognized that subjects can relapse after going for 2 years without a relapse (particularly subjects who were previously on an MS drug), so the predictive power of pre-study relapses for non-relapsing SPMS is incomplete. That said, this reviewer's analyses shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref> show that the reduction in <ref type="bibr">3-month</ref>  driven more by the subjects who experienced a relapse in the 2 years before the study than those who did not have a relapse in the 2 years before screening, suggesting that siponimod's treatment effect on 3-month CDP in this population is driven in part by its evident treatment effect on the inflammatory component of the disease.</p><p>The initial EDSS worsening could occur in the setting of a relapse but did not have to do so; however, the 3-month confirmation of this disability progression could not occur during an acute MS relapse. Because recovery from relapses may be incomplete, the number of MS subjects who experienced both a relapse and 3-month CDP event during the study is of interest. As shown in the secondary endpoint analysis later in this review (and as demonstrated by the approved S-1-P functional antagonist, fingolimod), siponimod appears quite effective at reducing relapses. Given this, it is unclear whether siponimod's effectiveness on reducing time to 3-month CDP is driven by relapse rate reduction (i.e., inflammatory events) or by altering the pathophysiology of the progressive phase of the disease (which is admittedly less well defined). The literature takes varying stances on the effect of reducing relapses in reducing disability; <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Lublin et al (2003)</ref> suggest that disability persists after almost 40% of relapses, but <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Tremlett et al (2009)</ref> suggest that the impact of relapses may be less in SPMS. Considering a topographical model of MS <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Krieger et al, 2016)</ref>, one might assume that recovery from relapses may depend on the degree of functional reserve (enabling recovery) and the clinical threshold to exhibit signs / symptoms. To clarify the effect of relapse reduction in CBAF312A2304, this reviewer performed time to 3-month CDP analyses in the subset of subjects with and without relapses during the study <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Figure 8</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 9</ref>, respectively).    Reviewer Comment: Although the differences in this reviewer's Kaplan-Meier curves above are visually suggestive of a differential benefit of siponimod on the time to 3month CDP in subjects who experienced relapses during the study, these differences do not meet statistical significance; however, this may relate to insufficient power because only a small minority of subjects experienced a relapse during CBAF312A2304. The graphs also suggest that subjects who experienced relapses during the trial were more likely to have disability progression that those who did not, which is not surprising given data that recovery from relapses is often incomplete <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Lublin et al., 2003)</ref>. It is recognized that analysis of an event (especially one open to interpretation, such as a relapse) occurring after randomization is subject to confounding and is fraught with difficulty. In sum, this analysis does not contribute much to the question of whether siponimod's effect on delaying 3-month CDP relates to its treatment effect on inflammatory disease.</p><p>The development of a gadolinium-enhancing lesion heralds the onset of an inflammatory event (relapse) in MS and represents a break-down of the blood brain barrier, allowing the margination of auto-reactive lymphocytes into the CNS <ref type="bibr">(Lassman, 2008)</ref>. As gadolinium enhancing lesions occur up to 10 times as frequently as relapses, measurement of these lesions is commonly used as a primary endpoint in Phase 2 studies in RMS.

Gadolinium-enhancing lesions are less common in SPMS, although "smoldering plaques" can be seen in SPMS <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Frischer et al, 2015)</ref>. This reviewer's Kaplan-Meier analyses of the time to 3month disability progression in subjects who had or did not have a gadolinium-enhancing lesion at baseline follow ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 10</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 11</ref>, respectively). Of note, data for the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions at baseline was missing for 52 subjects.    Reviewer Comment: The analyses shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 10</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 11</ref> suggest that the reduction in time to 3-month CDP appears to be partially driven by the subpopulation In addition to relapses and enhancing lesions, the development of new new/enlarging T2 lesions also represent sequelae of the inflammatory component of MS. The development of clinically silent lesions may represent relapses occurring in a "non-eloquent" location of the CNS (or those for which the CNS can rapidly compensate for the damage); indeed, a large metaanalysis of randomized clinical trials in MS <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Sormani 2009, Sormani and</ref><ref type="bibr">Bruzzi, 2013)</ref> suggests that new MRI lesions may be a surrogate for relapses with an R(2)=0.71. In addition to relapse rate reduction, S-1-P functional antagonists (including siponimod as discussed in the secondary endpoint analyses below) are effective at reducing new MRI lesions. As most T2 hyperintensities exhibit persistence over time, this reviewer's analyses of the primary endpoint in patients with and without new / enlarging T2 hyperintensities ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 12</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 13</ref>, respectively) may help clarify how much of the effect of 3-month CDP is related to an effect on the inflammatory component of the disease.    Reviewer Comment: The analyses shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 12</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 13</ref> suggest that the reduction in 3-month CDP occurs in more subjects who experienced new / enlarging T2 hyperintensities during the study than those who did not, further suggesting that siponimod's treatment effect may be driven by its reduction in MRI evidence of inflammatory disease. Although these post-hoc analyses consider a post-randomization event, the potential for bias with an imaging outcome is arguably less than that for a   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 14</ref> below is a snapshot of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 11</ref>-5 of the Clinical Study Report (CSR) that contains a forest plot of 3-month CDP hazard ratios for multiple subgroups. This forest plot includes 3 of the 4 subgroups (relapses before the study, relapses during the study, and baseline gadoliniumenhancing lesions) that were analyzed above, and it shows the subgroup results graphically with point estimates and 95% confidence intervals. It also suggests a differential benefit in women with a shorter disease duration, as suggested in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 22</ref> of this review, as well as a differential benefit in subjects with a moderate or severe course of disease and those with rapidly evolving disease. The sponsor's forest plot also shows the confidence interval of the hazard ratio for 3-month CDP crosses '1' for subjects with an EDSS of 6, which is notable because the median EDSS of the CBAF312A2304 population was 6.   Reviewer Comment: Relapsing MS is considered an inflammatory process, and secondary progressive MS is often deemed "degenerative" with the caveat that the pathophysiology of this progressive stage of the disease is less well understood and may be partially explained by a bio-energetic deficit from mitochondrial dysfunction, an inappropriate innate immune response, compartmentalized inflammation behind an intake blood brain barrier, or increased free radicals. A biomarker for SPMS does not exist, and the distinction between relapsing and progressive MS is obscured because inflammatory events (relapses or new MRI lesions) may occur in progressive MS: the 2013 revisions to the progressive MS phenotype allows the "Active" modifier to denote this . This distinction is further complicated in subjects who are currently on an MS medication to reduce inflammatory disease.</p></div>

The populations of the 2 positive SPMS trials (European interferon beta-1b, mitoxantrone) likely had late relapsing MS (or relapsing SPMS); therefore, the demonstrated benefit in these trials may have been driven by their effect on inflammatory disease, especially as the North American trial of interferon beta-1b in SPMS trial did not replicate this effect <ref type="bibr">(Lancet 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Hartung et al 2002</ref><ref type="bibr">, Neurol 2004</ref>. Even if this siponimod study population truly has secondary progressive MS (and is not a population of late relapsing remitting MS, as this reviewer suspects), the above analyses support the hypothesis that the delay in 3month CDP is more clearly related to the anti-inflammatory effect of siponimod (yielding a significant treatment effect on the relapsing or active aspect of the disease) than to an effect on the poorly understood "degenerative" process felt to dominant the pathophysiology of SPMS.</p><p>This reviewer performed a post-hoc time to-event analysis for the primary endpoint in the 955 subjects who did not have a relapse in the 2 years before the trial or during the trial. Although there is not a biomarker for inactive (non-relapsing, non-inflammatory) SPMS, this cohort (some of whom did not have a relapse in almost 5 years) may provide the best insight into whether siponimod's effect on 3-month CDP relates to its activity on relapsing / inflammatory disease or on the progressive / "degenerative" aspect of the disease.   Reviewer Comment: Siponimod does not appear to offer a significant benefit on 3month CDP in the subset of subjects who did not have relapses in the 2 years before the study or during the study. Given this result, and the above analyses suggesting that the effect of siponimod on 3-month CDP is driven by its effect on relapsing (inflammatory) disease, there may be a role for siponimod in individuals with relapses and active inflammation even though siponimod's capability of treating progressive disability in non-relapsing SPMS appears dubious.</p><p>As previously noted, the written attestations that subjects had SPMS defined by a progressive increase in disability (of at least 6 months duration) in the absence of, or independent of, relapses, were not collected. The inclusion criteria also required either clinical documentation of EDSS progression or a written summary of evidence of disability progression in the two years before the study. The clinical documentation was not collected for adjudication, but the written summaries were adjudicated, although not always before randomization. An Information Request was sent to analyze the time to 3-month CDP in subjects with documented EDSS progression and those with adjudicated written summaries. As per <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 16</ref>, the results of this analysis were not statistically significant for those subjects who lacked documentation of EDSS progression but had adjudicated written summaries of disability progression. The response, received on 3/4/2019, also states "Review of the demographic and baseline MS disease characteristics for the two subgroups revealed that patients included in the study based on adjudicated disability progression had longer disease duration, were slightly older, more severely disabled (based on EDSS) and had less inflammatory disease activity (Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline and pre-study relapses) compared to patients with documented EDSS progression, suggesting that this subgroup had more advanced SPMS."</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Quality and Integrity</head><p>Per the BAF312A2304 study protocol (page 62), EDSS assessments were performed by independent EDSS raters who were to "remain blinded to adverse events, concomitant medications, laboratory data, and any other data that have the potential of treatment assignment." In addition to scheduled EDSS assessments, unscheduled assessments were performed in the event of a potential MS relapse. When possible, the same EDSS rater performed subsequent assessments on the same subject, although this rater had access to the results of prior assessments. EDSS raters had to be trained and certified in the administration and scoring of the EDSS by achieving a Level C rating on the Neurostatus eTest. An electronic version of the EDSS could be used, as this tool could cross-check data input and identify inconsistencies; however, reference to this tool was removed in Amendment 4 of the protocol.</p><p>As the primary endpoint is 3-month CDP as measured by the EDSS, the baseline EDSS should occur just before or at randomization. As per <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 24</ref>, the baseline EDSS occurred after randomization in 143 subjects, so most had an EDSS assessment before or at randomization. Reviewer Comment: Most subjects had an EDSS recorded before or at randomization. Forty-two subjects <ref type="bibr">(22 siponimod, 20 placebo)</ref> experienced an onset of disability progression but then dropped out of the study before a 3-month disability event could be confirmed and thus were not included in the primary endpoint (3-month CDP) analysis. Only 5 of these disability onset events were attributed to a relapse. The most common reason (n=27) for these drop-outs was "Subject / Guardian Decision," and only six were for "Adverse Event." In the sponsor's sensitivity analysis #1 (categorizing these drop-outs as having confirmed disability progression on the date of disability onset), siponimod achieves a 24.1% risk reduction in 3month CDP (p=.0028). See <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 25</ref>.</p><p>As CBAF312A2304 is a time to event trial, it was possible for the study to end after some subjects had the onset of disability progression but before that disability progression could be confirmed 3 months later. This occurred in 81 subjects, 57 of whom were in the siponimod arm and 24 in the placebo arm. In the sponsor's sensitivity analysis #6 (subjects with disability onset that could not be confirmed at 3 months due to study completion), siponimod achieves a 23.1% risk reduction in 3-month CDP (p=0.0026). See <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 25</ref>.  n/N': n= number of subjects with events/N'=number of subjects included in the analysis (i.e. with non-missing covariates). Sensitivity analysis #1: subjects who discontinue Treatment Epoch prematurely and have a potential DP event at the end of the Core Part, were considered to have confirmed progression at the start date of this potential DP event. Sensitivity analysis #6: subjects who have a potential DP event at the end of the Core Part were considered to have confirmed progression at the start date of this potential DP event. Sensitivity analysis #7: Same as sensitivity analysis 6, but patients having potential DP with latest EDSS scores during relapse were not considered to have confirmed progression.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: Drop-outs were the subject of an Information Request (IR) sent to the sponsor on 7/19/2018. Even though dropouts after disability onset were more frequent in the placebo arm, sensitivity analysis #1 (which considered subjects who dropped out after a disability progression event to have 3-month CDP) suggests that these drop-outs did not significantly affect the results of this trial. Although the number of siponimod subjects with unconfirmed disability progression at the end of the study is somewhat higher than expected (compared with placebo), sensitivity analysis #6 and 7 suggest that this higher dropout rate for patients with unconfirmed disability progression did not impact the outcome of the trial either. Obviously, one caveat to acceptance of these sensitivity analyses is the potentially unblinding "dual database access issue."</p><p>To ensure accuracy, a possible MS relapse should be confirmed with an unscheduled visit for an EDSS (and laboratory assessment to rule out pseudo-exacerbation in the setting of an infection) soon after the onset of the relapse symptoms, ideally within a week. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 26</ref> below shows the mean times to relapse confirmation. Reviewer Comment: The mean time interval between the onset of relapse symptoms and the confirmatory EDSS is suboptimal, although this is not unusual in other MS clinical trials and may relate to delayed notification of the investigator that the subject was having new symptoms concerning for a relapse or a delayed relapse evaluation after a subject reported these symptoms. The median number of days suggests that half of relapses were confirmed in a reasonable amount of time (&lt;7 days).</p><p>Subjects could also drop out of the study after experiencing a relapse, whether confirmed or unconfirmed. As per the aforementioned 7/19/2018 IR, this occurred 71 times, 43 of which were in the placebo arm and 28 in the siponimod arm. Most of these drop-outs were for "Lack of Efficacy," "Subject / Guardian Decision," or "Progressive Disease."</p><p>Reviewer Comment: Almost 8% of subjects in the placebo arm dropped out of the A2304 study after experiencing a confirmed or unconfirmed relapse, but only about 3% of the siponimod arm did so.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time to 6-month CDP</head><p>Six-month confirmed EDSS progression is often felt to be a more difficult endpoint to meet than 3-month CDP due to the potential confounder of recovery from relapses with shorter term disability endpoints; however, relapse recovery may be more difficult (and slower) for subjects deemed to have SPMS, especially in a population with a median EDSS of 6.0. Despite this, this reviewer's analysis suggests that siponimod reduces the time to 6-month (24-week) confirmed EDSS progression, a secondary endpoint that was not prespecified as "key" or as part of the pre-specified hierarchical analysis. The risk reduction was 26% (p=0.0068). See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 18</ref>.   Reviewer comment: Although siponimod's treatment effect on 6-month CDP was statistically significant, the absolute reduction in 6-month CDP with siponimod was also quite modest at 5.6%. The Kaplan-Meier curve also suggests that over 70% of subjects (even those randomized to placebo) would not experience 6-month CDP after 3-years in the study, suggesting that the study population may not have been a prototypical SPMS population.</p></div>

Reviewer Comment: Similar to the pre-specified analysis of relapses in the 2 years before the study on 3-month CDP, this post-hoc analysis assessing the effect of pre-study relapses on 6-month CDP also suggests that the effect on siponimod on this end-point is driven by its treatment effect on the subset of subjects with continued relapses and inflammation in the 2-years before the study.</p><p>As per this reviewer's Kaplan-Meier graphs below ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 21</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">Figure 22</ref>), the effect on 6month CDP also appears to be driven by the subset of the population who had gadoliniumenhancing lesions at baseline.      suggests that the effect on siponimod on this end-point is driven by its effect on the subset of subjects with more inflammatory disease., i.e., those patients with gadolinium-enhancing lesions on a baseline MRI.</p></div>

This relapse rate reduction is similar to that for the approved S1P-modulator (fingolimod) and suggests that siponimod has treatment effect on relapses, which, as discussed above, appears to drive its effect on disability progression. Similar to my prior comments regarding the T2 lesion volume endpoint, the nominal p-value for this finding is very low (&lt;0.0001) and suggests that the chance of a Type I error is almost nil, even if the first "key" secondary endpoint of the study did not achieve statistical significance.</p><p>Obviously, some relapses were not confirmed by an EDSS worsening. Although some of these may have represented pseudo-relapses in the setting of fever / infection (Uhthoff's phenomenon) or natural fluctuations in symptom severity, some may have been missed inflammatory events, because the EDSS is criticized for being a non-linear scale and relatively insensitive to change in the middle of the overall scale (and the middle of the functional system subscales). <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 34</ref> below explores the incidence of unconfirmed relapses in CBAF312A2304. Reviewer Comment: It is noted that the relapse rates in the placebo-treated arm of CBAF312A2304 are lower than those in many other MS clinical trials, which may indicate a reduction in relapses in subjects later in the disease course and / or with SPMS. Given the rates of non-confirmed relapses, another possibility is the difficulty in confirming relapses: the non-linearity of the EDSS (and functional systems) makes it more difficult to demonstrate progression around an EDSS of 6 (or a functional system score &gt; 2).</p><p>Factoring relapse severity and relapse recovery into the analysis of relapses may offer more insight into the benefit of siponimod over placebo in this trial. Confirmed relapses treated with steroids or requiring hospitalization may suggest increased relapse severity, albeit with the caveat of potential confounders including subject and investigator preference, regional practice trends, and knowledge of treatment assignment due to ineffective blinding. The degree of recovery from a relapse may be confounded by the degree of existing MS pathology and the amount of remaining functional reserve. <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 35</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 36</ref> report this reviewer's descriptive statistics of the subject-calculated ARR in the subset of subjects having a confirmed relapse requiring steroids or hospitalization, respectively.  Reviewer Comment: The above unadjusted analyses are similar to those performed by the sponsor and suggest that siponimod reduces the number of relapses requiring steroids (unadjusted 46.6% ARR reduction) and those requiring hospitalization (60.7% reduction) compared with placebo in this trial. These may suggest that siponimod also reduces relapse severity, although subject / investigator preference and regional practice trends may confound this analysis.  Reviewer Comment: The above analysis replicates that of the sponsor and suggests that siponimod reduces the number of relapses with incomplete recovery compared with placebo in this trial by <ref type="bibr">49.2% (unadjusted ARR)</ref>. This may also suggest a reduction in relapse severity with siponimod, although pre-existing MS pathology and the lack of a functional reserve may confound this analysis. This reduction in relapse severity may further suggest siponimod's effect on the pathophysiology underlying the relapsing aspect of the disease.</p><p>Note that all of the ARR analyses performed above yielded a reduction of over 50%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Enhancing T1 lesions</head><p>Another non-key secondary endpoint of interest in CBAF312A2304 is the number of gadolinium enhancing lesions. Many subjects did not experience an observed enhancing lesion during the trial, probably because of the studied population (SPMS) and the observation that the typical MS lesion enhances with gadolinium for an average of 3 weeks, even without treatment with steroids <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cotton et al, 2003)</ref>. Because CBAF312A2304 is a time to event trial in which subjects were able to transition to open-label siponimod after experiencing 6-month CDP, the number of subjects decreases in the 24-and 36-month analyses below.   Reviewer Comment: The number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions in this reviewer's analysis above is essentially the same as noted in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 14</ref>. <ref type="bibr">2-6.1</ref> in the CSR. Similar to this study's treatment effect on relapses, the reduction in gadolinium-enhancing lesions is notable and, per the sponsor's analyses, is nominally highly statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001) at 12 and 24 months. These analyses show siponimod's efficacy on reducing enhancing (active, inflammatory) lesions on MRI, further supporting this reviewer's hypothesis that siponimod's effect on disability progression is driven by its antiinflammatory effect.</p></div>

FDA stated that the relapsing benefit in A2304 supported by A2201 might support the submission of an NDA for relapsing MS, This reviewer's analysis of 3month CDP in CBAF312A2304 also suggests that siponimod may be effective in relapsing MS, as does its effects on the change in T2 lesion volume, ARR, and T1 enhancing lesions. It would not be surprising for siponimod to have a benefit on relapsing MS, as there are three positive Phase 3 trials supporting the use of another medication with a similar mechanism of action (fingolimod) for this indication.</p><p>The inclusion criteria for a "typical" Phase 3 trial in relapsing MS would select subjects with one relapse in the past year or 2 relapses in the past 2 years. To continue to explore the potential role of siponimod in relapsing disease, this reviewer performed some of the preceding analyses below in the subset of subjects in A2304 who would qualify for a "typical" RRMS trial. See <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 41</ref>. Reviewer Comment: 24% (394) of subjects in A2304 would have qualified for a typical RRMS study given one or more relapses in the past 12 months or more than one relapse in the past 24 months. The following post-hoc analyses in this section of the review will be performed on this subset of CBAF312A2304, which will be denoted as "QualRRMS." It is also recognized that the relatively small size of this cohort may cause the subsequent analyses to have insufficient power for definitive conclusions. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 41</ref> contains descriptive statistics on the confirmed ARR in subjects in the QUALRRMS subset of CBAF312A2304 who would qualify for a typical RRMS study. Reviewer Comment: In this post-hoc analysis, the subset of subjects who would qualify for a "typical" RRMS study exhibited a 55% reduction in unadjusted ARR (p=0.0035). This result aligns well with the results of the ARR analysis in the entire A2304 population as well as the placebo-controlled RMS study described on the labeling of a similar approved S1P receptor modulator (fingolimod) in which a reduction of over 50% in ARR was observed.</p></div>

The difference between siponimod and placebo was 929.4mm 3 at 12 months (p=0.0003), 859.5mm 3 at 24 months (p=0.0051), and 1186.6 mm 3 at 36 months (p=0.0042).

The reduction was not statistically significant at <ref type="bibr">36 months (p=0.19)</ref>; however, the number of patients remaining in this time to event trial at 36 months was quite low.

Reductions in heart rate were common after administration of the first dose of siponimod, so a separate team and database were used to collect safety information related to this first dose administration. Unfortunately, 34 users of the main study database for CBAF312A2304 were inadvertently granted access to the first dose database, a potential source of unblinding for 101 subjects. This reviewer repeated an unadjusted analysis of the primary endpoint for the 1544 subjects whose data was not compromised by this dual database issue -see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 25</ref>.  The sponsor provided a sensitivity analysis suggesting that the results of the Timed 25foot walk were not affected by this dual database access issue and an impact analysis suggesting that the ARR, symbol digit modality test, and MRI metric analyses were also not affected by this dual database access issue. Especially given the potential effect that the "dual database access" issue had on the 3-month CDP primary endpoint, this reviewer does not find these analyses reassuring, because multiple other clinical considerations, up to recommending that a subject discontinue the trial, can be influenced by the degradation of the study blind.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3-month confirmed 20% T25FW worsening in subjects in QUALRRMS</head><p>Time to 3-month CDP in subjects from USA Because the sponsor is seeking approval for marketing in the United States, this reviewer's analysis of the primary endpoint (time to 3-mos CPD) was repeated on the subset of the subjects from the United States.  Reviewer Comment: As above, a post-hoc analysis of the cohort of subjects from the US did not achieve a statistically significant difference on the primary outcome of time to 3month CDP, although the effect size is similar. This lack of statistical significance could relate to power given the relatively low percentage of the study population that was from the US (&lt;10%), or it could relate to the identified regional, ethnic, and genetic differences in the disease. The sponsor provides an analysis suggesting that the lack of efficacy may be driven by the relatively higher number of low-enrolling sites in the US. This reviewer agrees and suspects that with more robust study enrollment (or with postmarketing use of siponimod) in the US, the US experience with siponimod will converge on the results achieved by the European study sites.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment: The inclusion and exclusion criteria seem reasonable and appropriate for a Phase 2 RRMS study. Although the intent of this lengthy list of exclusion criteria is</head><p>probably attributable to an appropriate sense of caution, this list makes it cumbersome for investigators to find eligible subjects to enroll subjects in this study, potentially leading to slowed enrollment and protocol deviations. Even more concerning is that this highly selected population may not represent "real world" individuals with MS and may underestimate the safety of the drug in a "real world" setting unless the label specifies similar restrictions on the use of siponimod. CABF312A2201 was designed to explore the dose-response curves for siponimod. The highest dose of siponimod tested in the study was 10 mg daily, as this showed near-maximal (80%) reduction in lymphocyte counts in the Phase I study. It was predicted that siponimod 0.5mg daily would reduce lymphocytes by less than 50%. The first cohort randomized subjects to 10 mg, 2 mg, or 0.5 mg of siponimod (or placebo). The doses for cohort 2 (siponimod 1.25 mg daily, siponimod 0.25 mg daily, and placebo) were selected based on analysis of the doseresponse data from the first cohort.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First Dose Monitoring</head><p>It is known that administration of the first dose of S1P functional antagonists like siponimod can cause temporary heart rate reductions or bradyarrhythmias, for which subjects were monitored in the study. In cohort 1, vitals were assessed pre-dose and for at least 6 hours after the first dose. Given an observed bradyarrhythmia signal in cohort 1, a 10-day dose titration was used in cohort 2 -vitals were checked before the first dose and for 6 hours after the first, 2 nd , and 7 th dose. EKGs were to be checked before the first dose and 2, 4, and 6 hours after the first dose in cohort 1. Mobile Cardiac Telemetry (MCT) was utilized during the dose titration in subjects in cohort 2.</p><p>To preserve blinding of treatment status, the initial dose of study treatment was administered by an independent First Dose Administrator, who monitored the subjects cardiovascular and pulmonary status after that dose of study medication was given. The First Dose Administrator would not divulge findings to patients, the study staff, or the sponsor unless there was a significant medical need to do so.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concomitant Medication</head><p>The investigator instructed subjects to notify the study site about any new medications taken or prescribed after the subject was enrolled in the study. Recording of all medications and significant non-drug therapies (including physical therapy and blood transfusions) administered after enrollment in the study was required.</p><p>Immunosuppressive medications, immunoglobulins, monoclonal antibodies, beta-interferons, glatiramer acetate, ACTH, oral / inhaled steroids (except for short courses of steroids for an MS relapse), plasma exchange, and medications that impair cardiac conduction were not to be used during the study unless the study drug was permanently discontinued. Live or live attenuated vaccines were not to be used during the study or until 3-months after cessation of the study drug. Medications that induce or inhibit CYP2C9 were not to be co-administered with siponimod. The use of anticholinergics and beta-agonists was allowed for the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia associated with siponimod.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary Efficacy Endpoint</head><p>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the dose response relationship among five doses of BAF312 and placebo during 3 months of treatment in patients with RRMS, as measured by the number of combined unique active [MRI] lesions (CUAL). CUAL requires a prior study for comparison, so techniques need to be followed to ensure image comparability, including similar sequences, slice thickness (without gap), and orientation (subcallosal line). T2 lesions in MS are typically persistent, although detection of small new lesions can be challenging in subjects who have already accrued a high burden of MRI disease. Enhancing lesions in MS typically enhance for 3-6 weeks and are relatively easy to identify, although it is necessary to ensure that the abnormal signal is not representative of a blood vessel or vascular anomaly. Enhancing lesions are typically hypointense on non-contrasted T1 scans. These T1 hypointense lesions ("black holes") can be persistent but are not necessarily so, especially if they appear less hypointense ("greyer"). At 6 months, almost 40% of T1 black holes will remain hypointense, and these persistent black holes are thought to correlate well with the degree of  <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cotton 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">, Sahraian 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">, van Waesberghe 1998</ref>.</p></div>

Reviewer Comment: This analysis duplicates that of the sponsor (CSR <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 11</ref> <ref type="bibr">-6)</ref>. Although this study was not powered to show a treatment effect on relapses, this analysis suggests that siponimod 2 mg may have a treatment effect on reducing relapses, which is not surprising given the expected class effect of S1P receptor modulators (including the approved drug, fingolimod) on relapse rates.</p><p>The sponsor also analyzed relapse rate reductions with a negative binomial regression model adjusted for treatment group, number of relapses in the prior 2 years, with log (time on study in years) as the offset variable.

Reviewer Comment: In this analysis, the 2 mg dose of siponimod showed an effect on reducing relapse rates, albeit with only marginally nominal statistical significance; however, CBAF312A2201 was not powered to show an effect on ARR, especially given the brief duration of treatment, and thus should not be considered an adequate and well-designed study necessary to show substantial evidence of effectiveness.</p></div>

Reviewer Comment: This reviewer performed an analysis of CUAL reduction at 6-months in the first cohort of CBAF312A2201. This analysis is congruent with the dose-response analysis performed above (for the primary endpoint) and suggests that siponimod is effective at reducing CUAL and suggests that the 2 mg proposed marketing dose was appropriate for further study and is likely to be effective in reducing relapse rate.</p><p>The second cohort of 109 subjects was treated for 3-months with either siponimod 1.25mg, siponimod 0.25mg, or placebo (randomized 4:4:1), and monthly MRIs were performed.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment of Efficacy Across Trials</head><p>An integrated assessment of efficacy is limited as the two clinical trials of siponimod in MS utilized different populations (RRMS vs. SPMS) and different primary endpoints (CUAL vs. 3-month CDP).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary Endpoints</head><p>The primary endpoint for the Phase 2 study in RRMS (CBAF312A2201) was a doseresponse reduction in the number of combined unique active lesions (CUAL) on MRI among 5 doses of siponimod and placebo. As shown in Section 6.2, CBAF312A2201 achieves statistical significance on this endpoint.</p><p>The primary endpoint for the Phase 3 study of siponimod 2 mg daily in SPMS (CBAF312A2304) was time to 3-month confirmed disability progression (CDP). Although the effect appears to have been driven by an effect on inflammation and relapses, CBAF312A2304 achieved a statistically significant relative risk reduction of 21% (absolute risk reduction of 5.5%) on time to 3-month CDP (p=0.013), as shown in Section 6.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary and Other Endpoints</head><p>Annualized relapse rate (ARR) is a secondary endpoint of interest in the CBAF312A2201 study. Although the study was not adequately powered to show a difference on ARR, the 2 mg dose did achieve nominal statistical significance in this study (p=0.0408).</p><p>CBAF312A2304 utilized a hierarchical analysis of the primary endpoint (time to 3-month CDP) and two secondary endpoints (time to confirmed 20% worsening on the Timed 25 Foot Walk and change in T2 lesion volume) that were identified as "key." The first "key" secondary endpoint (time to confirmed 20% worsening on T25FW) did not achieve statistical significance (relative risk reduction of 6%, p=0.44). Despite the failure of the first "key" secondary endpoint in the hierarchical analysis to achieve statistical significance, the second "key" endpoint (change in T2 lesion volume) in the hierarchy achieved a robust treatment effect with a nominally highly significant nominal p-value (&lt;0.0001).</p><p>CBAF312A2304 also assessed the effect of siponimod on ARR, a "non-key" secondary endpoint (55% relative risk reduction, nominal p&lt;0.0001); however, the absolute relapse rates were very low (0.07 in the siponimod arm, 0.16 in the placebo arm) in this </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subpopulations</head><p>Sixty percent of the subjects in CBAFA2304 were women. As per the forest plot in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 14</ref>, the confidence interval for the analysis of the primary endpoint (3-month CDP) included '1' for both women and men.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Efficacy Considerations</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Considerations on Benefit in the Postmarket Setting</head><p>In CBAF312A2304, much of the benefit of siponimod was due to its effect on relapses and inflammation, outcomes which research and clinical experience suggest do not provide significant clinical benefits in patients with SPMS who are not experiencing relapses. This reviewer is concerned that many people with non-relapsing SPMS will be treated with siponimod despite a lack of data to support a benefit in this population, leading to their potential exposure to the manifold risks associated with receiving a therapy lacking expectation of efficacy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Relevant Benefits</head><p>This reviewer is not convinced by suggestions that S1P receptor modulators may stimulate oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC), and the sponsor provides no clinical evidence to support that this alleged effect would be significantly different for siponimod than for other S1P modulator therapies <ref type="bibr">(Zhang et al, 2015)</ref>. This reviewer does not foresee any other potentially relevant benefits of siponimod at this time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Integrated Assessment of Effectiveness</head><p>It is difficult to provide an across trial comparison as the two trials supporting the NDA for siponimod utilize different populations, different endpoints, and different study designs. CBAF312A2304 achieves statistical significance on its primary endpoint (time to 3-month CPD based on EDSS) in subjects classified as having SPMS; however, its failure to achieve statistical significance on the first "key" secondary endpoint (time to 3-month confirmed T25FW worsening) may not be congruent with this EDSS finding. Further, some issues with the conduction of the study were identified, including a "dual database access" issue affecting 101 subjects. A sensitivity analysis removing these subjects has a significant impact on the p-value of the 3-month CDP result, weakening it from almost 0.01 to over 0.05. Given these issues, this reviewer is not convinced that the statistical strength of this un-replicated 3-month CDP finding is sufficient to show substantial evidence of effectiveness to support the approval of siponimod with an indication of SPMS.</p><p>It is apparent that much (if not all) of siponimod's apparent treatment effect on increasing disability is derived from its effect on relapses and MRI lesions (i.e., inflammation) in subjects with relapsing SPMS (or late RRMS), raising the question of whether there is sufficient evidence of effectiveness to support an indication of relapsing forms of MS, especially given the support that CBAF312A2201 offers for this indication. This reviewer is bothered by the small number of subjects in CBAF312A2304 who experienced a relapse, the dose-finding design of CBAF312A2201, the marginal nominal significance (p=0.0408) of the single dose arm of CBAF312A2201 to achieve significance on ARR (although admittedly this study was not powered for ARR), and the designation of ARR as secondary in both trials. Despite these concerns, these studies provide evidence to support an indication of relapsing MS. The robust effect on MRI metrics in both trials is also supportive of a relapsing MS indication, although MRI is not a measure of how a person "functions, feels, or survives," and the relevance of MRI metrics is potentially questioned by their relatively poor correlation with clinical disability progression and the "clinico-radiologic paradox." Factoring in the efficacy of other immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive agents (including the approved S1P receptor modulator, fingolimod), this reviewer finds that there is likely substantial evidence of effectiveness to support the approval of siponimod with an indication for relapsing forms of MS.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit-Risk Assessment</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit-Risk Integrated Assessment</head><p>In their NDA for siponimod, the applicant seeks approval for the treatment of patients with secondary progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (SPMS). The safety databases contain patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis and progressive multiple sclerosis, and this review analyzes the collective risks in all patients and when appropriate notes differences in findings between the two multiple sclerosis subtypes. This review evaluates the safety of siponimod. If efficacy is demonstrated and the benefits of siponimod outweigh the risks of multiple sclerosis, then I recommend that approval be accompanied by labeling language including warnings and a medication guide to mitigate the identified risks.</p><p>This document reviews the risk profile of siponimod. Use of siponimod is associated with the known class effects of S1P modulators such as lymphopenia, infections, bradyarrhythmias, macular edema, elevated liver transaminases, hypertension, and decreased pulmonary function tests. Some of these adverse reactions have the potential for more serious outcomes in the post marketing period in which there is less frequent monitoring of patients than in the setting of clinical trials. Warnings in the labeling and in a Medication Guide for patients may mitigate potentially serious outcomes of these adverse reactions. A recommendation regarding approval for an indication can only by made based on a consideration of benefit and of risk. I will provide an assessment of the risks and recommendations for labeling to mitigate the risk if efficacy is demonstrated. If the efficacy reviewer determines the benefits outweigh the risk, then siponimod would be approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risk:</head><p>Siponimod is associated with a risk of infections because of a dose-dependent decrease in serum lymphocytes. Almost 50% of patients in controlled trials experienced infections, and while most were mild, there were cases of sepsis and deaths associated with infections. Opportunistic infections were not identified in association with siponimod in controlled trials, but, based on experience with other S1P modulators, it is expected that postmarketing experience will reveal opportunistic infection risk. Siponimod is associated with induction of bradycardia and can cause more serious atrioventricular block in some patients. Labeling will need to describe the titration scheme that reduces the risk for most patients, symptoms of concern for cardiovascular toxicity for all patients, and additional cardiac monitoring needed in higher risk patients. Siponimod is associated with macular edema and patients should obtain an ophthalmological examination for any visual change. Siponimod is associated with elevated blood pressure and a risk of hypertension; patients should be monitored and treated for hypertension. Siponimod is associated with decreased respiratory function testing and respiratory symptoms. Other S1P modulators have been associated severe exacerbation of multiple sclerosis after discontinuation, and this potential for severe disability after stopping should be included on labeling for all S1P modulator therapies. Siponimod is processed by a specific cytochrome, CYP2C9, and patients with the *3/*3 variant of this enzyme should be contraindicated from taking siponimod because of their relative inability to metabolize it leading to exposures associated with higher risk of AEs. Determination of a patient's CYP2C9 genotype is necessary before starting therapy because maintenance dosing and co-administration of siponimod with inducers/inhibitors of the CYP2C9 pathway will need to be based on patient genotype.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis and Recommendations Regarding Safety:</head><p>The risks associated with siponimod are minor, largely amenable to treatment, or end with discontinuation of the therapy. If the clinical efficacy review recommends approval, the rarity of serious, irreversible, or fatal events would not preclude approval of siponimod. I recommend Warnings and Precautions for infections, macular edema, bradyarrhythmia, liver injury, severe exacerbations after discontinuation, respiratory effects, and hypertension. I recommend describing epilepsy and thromboembolic event frequencies observed in the clinical trials in Section 6 of labeling. I recommend guidance for the initial titration of siponimod to mitigate the risk of cardiac conduction abnormalities and increased cardiac monitoring for patients rated as "higher risk" based on criteria used to stratify cardiac risk in clinical trials. Patients with significant cardiac disease or high degree atrioventricular blocks should not take siponimod because of the cardiac effects. I recommend genotype-based dosing for siponimod and for inhibitors and inducers of the CYP2C9 pathway. I recommend a Medication Guide to describe these risks and symptoms of concern. I recommend enhanced pharmacovigilance in post marketing for events of serious infections including opportunistic infections and for malignancies.</p><p>I recommend postmarketing requirements as follows: a prospective study of respiratory effects of siponimod, a pregnancy registry, a pregnancy outcomes study, a juvenile toxicology study, a pediatric study, and a postmarketing commitment to develop an assay for CYP2C9 genotype specific for siponimod. Sixteen deaths (0.6%, 0.35/100 PY) have occurred in siponimodtreated patients in controlled and open label studies of multiple sclerosis: 2 by myocardial infarctions with one patient having a lengthy smoking history and a family history of myocardial infarction, 1 due to craniocerebral injury after seizures causing traumatic falls, 1 completed suicide with a history of depression and recent antidepressant initiation with acute stress in his professional life, 1 of urosepsis over 50 days from last dose of siponimod and after receiving rituximab, 1 of septic shock in setting of end-stage metastatic cancer, 1 of malignant melanoma with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome 31 days after discontinuation of siponimod, 1 due to lung adenocarcinoma 4 months after discontinuation of siponimod and with a lengthy smoking history, 1 due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 2 due to respiratory compromise in patients with advanced progressive multiple sclerosis 58 and 267 days after last doses of siponimod, 1 of unknown reasons who had conduction block during initial dose titration and provide monitoring recommendations accordingly to mitigate these potential risks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit-Risk Dimensions Dimension Evidence and Uncertainties Conclusions and Reasons</head><p>Siponimod is associated with lymphopenia and a risk of infections, and uncertainty exists in whether the outcomes of infections would be more serious in an unmonitored outpatient setting or in patients with other risks of immunosuppression due to exposure to other multiple sclerosis therapies. Labeling infections as a Warning would highlight the need for awareness of the potential for infections and may mitigate the risk for serious outcomes.</p><p>Based on postmarketing experience with another S1P modulator, siponimod will likely be associated with an increased risk of serious complications associated with prolonged immunosuppression such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Labeling will need to warn of the potential for cryptococcal meningitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and other opportunistic infections. Siponimod appears to be associated with an increased risk of serious vascular events such as stroke and myocardial infarction.</p><p>Siponimod appears to be associated with an increased frequency of falls associated with serious injuries including concussions, bone fractures, and head trauma. These falls may be related to the increased frequency of dizziness reported by patients taking siponimod relative to placebo patients.</p><p>Siponimod maintenance dose requires knowing a patient's genotype of the cytochrome responsible for siponimod processing CYP2C9 with high metabolizer genotypes taking 2 mg daily and low metabolizing genotypes taking 1 mg daily maintenance, respectively. Siponimod is contraindicated for the CYP2C9 *3/*3 genotype.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Siponimod is associated with lymphopenia, hypertension, macular</head><p>Siponimod labeling should reflect Warnings established for other S1P modulators that are expected to occur with siponimod including unexpected neurological effects, severe exacerbations in multiple sclerosis after discontinuation, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.</p><p>There was an imbalance in strokes associated with siponimod treatment during controlled trials despite equal risks of stroke risk factors between treatment groups. There were no clear risk factors that appeared to confer greater risk or predict events.</p><p>There was an imbalance in AEs and SAEs related to falls and dizziness in both clinical trials in patients with multiple sclerosis. These events should be described in labeling. Risk of cutaneous malignancy may rise in the postmarket setting as it did in association with use of another S1P modulator therapy in MS. Enhanced reporting of malignancies will help identify if there is a risk that needs to be addressed in labeling.</p><p>Warnings and a Medication Guide with information regarding the main safety risks may help mitigate serious outcomes of these Genotype-based dosing may mitigate increased risks of serious adverse events associated with siponimod treatment due to relative differences in metabolism between genotypes.</p><p>A postmarketing requirement for a pregnancy registry and outcomes study will help to evaluate the risks of siponimod exposure in pregnancy and prenatal development. Another postmarketing requirement will be a need for a trial to examine longitudinal effects of siponimod on respiratory testing and respiratory symptoms.</p><p>A postmarketing commitment will direct the applicant to the develop an assay to determine patient genotype that is specifically for use with siponimod.</p><p>Pediatric and supportive nonclinical in juvenile animal studies are postmarketing requirements to establish the safety of siponimod in children and adolescents with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.</p><p>risks in the postmarketing setting.</p><p>Labeling will provide instructions for all patients to undergo electrocardiogram to determine baseline risk and for patients with existing or historical bradyarrhythmias to undergo first dose monitoring.</p><p>A specific assay for siponimod genotyping is needed. There are genotype assays in widespread commercial use that may be used "off-label" for genotyping until the applicant validates a test specific for siponimod.</p><p>Siponimod interferes with S1P receptors with a significant role in cardiac development and therefore represents a potential risk of association with cardiac birth defects. Because the risk of adverse outcomes in pregnancy has not been characterized fully, and because siponimod will be administered to women of childbearing potential, a pregnancy registry should be a postmarketing requirement.  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system characterized by neurologic deficits that are due to one of more areas of injury to myelin, oligodendrocytes, and neurons, specifically, the neuronal axon. Acute inflammation injury may occur in the subcortical white matter, brainstem, optic nerve, or the spinal cord. The diagnostic precepts used in establishing a diagnosis of MS require clinical or imaging evidence of a dissemination of neurological deficits and injuries "in space and time." 1 Approximately 85% of patients diagnosed with MS initially have a form characterized by acute inflammatory attacks termed relapses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">2</ref> This waxing and waning pattern of symptoms is the origin of the clinical subtyping of "relapsing and remitting" forms of MS as opposed to the rarer "progressive" forms of MS that may not have clearly identifiable periods of remission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Therapeutic Context</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Condition</head><p>Although early relapses in relapsing MS may be followed by complete recovery, over time, in most patients, there is an accumulation of residual deficits and increasing disability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">2</ref> In some patients, disability progression is occurs in parallel and seemingly independent of acute exacerbations, and this phase of the disease (which may be an entirely different disease) is termed "secondary progressive multiple sclerosis" (SPMS). <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">3</ref> Patients with SPMS may or may not continue to experience discrete relapses and the overall appearance of their disease course is more consistent with a neurodegenerative process than a pulsatile relapse-remission history. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">4</ref> With no clear consensus about the exact pathophysiology underlying SPMS, there are proposed classifications of SPMS that include specifying whether there is "active" disease, the referenced activity being evidence of clinical relapses and inflammation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">4</ref> In the absence of a defining pathological mechanism, there are no accepted biomarkers to define SPMS with clinical certainty, and, as such, the diagnosis of SPMS remains a subject of continued debate and research.</p><p>With uncertainty about diagnosis comes difficulty in treatment. Despite much progress in the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, for which there are over a dozen approved therapies presently, there exists a paucity of effective treatments for SPMS. Presently, there is one approved therapy indicated for any defined form of SPMS, mitoxantrone, a therapy that is not often used in clinical practice because of significant toxicities. There exists an unmet medical need for effective therapies for SPMS that can be used longitudinally without an associated risk of potentially life-shortening or life-ending complications as exist with mitoxantrone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Current Treatment Options</head><p>The currently approved therapies for Relapsing forms of MS (RMS), Primary Progressive multiple sclerosis, and SPMS are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref>. Available therapies reduce the annualized relapse rate in patients with RMS by 30 to 50%. While a reduction in the number of relapses is desirable, it is unclear whether reducing relapse frequency results in a significant reduction in long-term disability. Differences in methodology and in the populations studied limit interpretation of the full effect of these therapies on permanent disability. Several studies have shown a numeric reduction in some measure of disability that was confirmed 12 and/or 24 weeks after an initial significant increase in a given disability score. However, if a statistically significant reduction was seen in one trial, the result was usually not replicated in a second trial. Although most therapies approved for the treatment of RMS show a reduction in various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) findings associated with RMS, the interpretation of these neuroimaging changes in the context of patient function do not support the use of any of these MRI measures as primary criteria for the choice of therapy.</p><p>Because they were the earliest approved therapies and because there have been few major safety concerns, either a β-interferon or glatiramer acetate are often the initial choice for treatment for new onset typical RMS. Because the interferons share the same presumed mechanism of action and have similar efficacy, if the response is not adequate to one interferon then the choice of next therapy is usually not a different interferon and usually not glatiramer acetate. There are now several approved alternative therapies with efficacy at least comparable to the interferons and glatiramer acetate. The data available are not enough to conclude that the efficacy of any of the alternative therapies is superior to the older "first line" therapies.</p><p>Each approved therapy has unique benefits and risks. Unless there is strong evidence of superior efficacy and/or a notable lack of safety concerns, any new approved therapy will most likely be used for those who have not responded adequately to the interferons, glatiramer acetate, and possibly one of the approved oral therapies. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Pharmacology</head><p>The mechanism of action of siponimod is modulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors. Siponimod selectively targets the S1P1 and S1P5 subtypes of the S1P receptor family. The interaction between siponimod and S1P receptors promotes rapid and long-lasting internalization of surface S1P receptors. Lymphocytes rely on S1P signaling to translocate from lymph nodes into the circulating serum. Reducing S1P receptors on lymphocytes' surfaces inhibits their egress from lymph nodes and reduces the number of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. The siponimod-related reduction in circulating lymphocytes appears to inhibit the inflammatory autoimmune processes associated with MS.</p><p>The data below regarding pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are from the Clinical Overview provided by the applicant and reflect the findings most relevant to safety.</p><p>The effective half-life at steady state ranges between 22-36 hours. At the 2 mg dose, the typical female SPMS patient experiences a 79% reduction in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) compared to baseline.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Review Approach</head><p>My review strategy will be to focus this safety review on findings from clinical trials of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) because the applicant seeks approval for siponimod as a treatment for the secondary progressive form of MS (SPMS). Although the applicant seeks approval for SPMS treatment in this NDA, the application also includes findings from clinical trials of siponimod in patients with relapsing forms of MS. The applicant included reports from trials in smaller populations of patients diagnosed with autoimmune diseases that have different primary manifestations from MS, dermatomyositis, and polymyositis, and these trials will support findings from the MS trials. The clinical pharmacology studies undertaken largely in healthy subjects will further inform the findings in patients with MS exposed to siponimod but are not a primary focus of this review. I will confine the major discussions and conclusions of this review to safety findings in the indicated population, patients with MS, which includes safety data from patients with relapsing forms of MS and patients with SPMS.</p><p>In this application, the applicant seeks approval for the treatment of patients with SPMS. The protocol of the pivotal study in this application defined patients with SPMS as those with progression of disability "in the absence of relapses, or independent of relapses" and who have not had evidence of or corticosteroid treatment for a relapse in the three months prior to entering the trial. While this definition of SPMS is reasonable and was agreed upon by the Agency prior to trial initiation, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted clinical definition of SPMS, and there is debate about whether progressive and relapsing forms of MS represent a continuum of the same disease or are distinct, separate, pathological disease processes.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The patient population in the pivotal trial in this application who experienced a significant treatment effect were patients who were continuing to experience relapses, despite the applicant's claim these were prototypical SPMS patients (who would not be expected to be experiencing relapses.) Therefore, the indicated population for whom benefit would be predicted would be described best as patients with active SPMS, which is a relapsing form of MS. I will provide a broad review encompassing both forms of MS because there is considerable overlap between these two populations.</p><p>The MS clinical development program for siponimod includes two controlled, randomized clinical trials. The applicant conducted Study A2304 in patients with SPMS and Study A2201 in patients with RMS.</p><p>Study CBAF312A2304 (abbreviated as Study A2304) is a 1651-patient, randomized, doubleblind, parallel group, placebo-controlled variable treatment duration Phase 3 study undertaken in patients with SPMS. In this study, patients followed a week-long titration to a maintenance dose <ref type="bibr">(2 mg)</ref>. The duration of the core portion of this study was variable and based on the number of confirmed disability events at 3-months, the primary efficacy endpoint. This study has an ongoing extension trial (CBAF312A2304EP or 2304EP) that has 1220 enrolled patients as of the safety update cut-off date of December 31, 2017.</p><p>Study CBAF312A2201 (abbreviated as Study A2201) is a 297-patient, randomized, double-blind, randomized, multi-center, adaptive, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, twoperiod Phase 2 study undertaken in patients with RMS. In Study A2201, patients with RMS were exposed to several doses of siponimod for three-or six-months' duration. There were two periods in Study A2201, and in Period 2, a titration schedule for siponimod was introduced to reduce side effects associated with starting treatment at maintenance dose. After completion of the controlled portion of this trial, patients could enroll in an open label extension trial of 2 mg siponimod for up to three more years. The extension of this study, A2201E enrolled 184 patients for up to five years of observation.</p><p>This review relies primarily on the safety data from Studies A2201 and A2304 because these safety data originated in patients with the desired indication for approval, multiple sclerosis. I refer to additional efficacy and safety data that were provided as part of the ongoing extension study of Study A2304 and the long-term extension study of Study A2201, Study CBAF312A2201E1. I discuss safety data from the single and multiple dose clinical pharmacology studies and controlled studies performed in patients with dermatomyositis and polymyositis (CBAF312A2202, CBAF312X2205, and CBAF312X2206) to provide additional support for the findings in the MS development program.</p><p>In this review, I summarize information from the applicant's presentations, and, when needed, supplement the Applicant's reported findings with analyses that I conducted using data provided in the Clinical Study Report, the Integrated Summary of Safety, Safety Updates, Addenda, and all other the data provided by the applicant in the application and in responses to formal Information Requests. I performed analyses using the JMP software program. For adverse events (AEs), I present the safety data from studies in other indications to demonstrate commonly reported events and infrequent events of potential concern to supplement and to inform the main presentation of AEs from the MS trials. Because there were several siponimod treatment doses used in clinical trials, I will focus most safety discussions on the proposed marketing dose of 2 mg.</p><p>To contextualize the subject of this review, siponimod is in the class of S1P receptor modulators--fingolimod being the prototypical member--that inhibit lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes. Chronic administration of S1P modulator therapies lowers the circulating lymphocyte count and presumably reduces the number of auto-reactive lymphocytes available to migrate to the CNS where they would contribute to the pathology associated with MS. The exact mechanism of action of siponimod is unknown but presumed proposed to be a decrease in CNS autoimmune injury resulting from a reduction in the circulating lymphocyte pool.</p><p>Prior experience with the S1P receptor modulator therapies has identified several AEs and risks associated the use of S1P modulators. These risks include initial dose bradycardia and cardiac conduction block, macular edema, serious infections including opportunistic infections seen in immune compromised patients, hypertension, increased liver enzymes (without liver failure), reduction in the Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1), reduction in the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and cutaneous malignancies. I interrogated the databases the applicant provided to assess whether there were any new safety issues both related and unrelated to these known AEs. I will analyze studies performed in patients with any form of MS collectively and broken down by MS subtype in respective studies. The goal is to arrive at a comprehensive summary of safety risks associated with siponimod therapy in the indicated population.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Population Exposure</head><p>In the original NDA submission (cut-off date May 31, 2017), the applicant stated a total of approximately 3278 unique subjects (1249 healthy subjects, 24 hepatic impaired subjects, 8 renal impaired subjects, 49 PM/DM patients and 1948 MS patients) have been enrolled into the siponimod clinical program (inclusive of Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3). There were 2760 unique patients who had been exposed to at least one dose of siponimod, and of these patients, 1737 patients had been exposed to siponimod (any dose or duration) in Phase 2 and 3 controlled trials in MS. the applicant provided exploratory trial data from an additional 49 patients with polymyositis and dermatomyositis exposed to doses ranging from 0.5 mg-10 mg of siponimod. The cumulative exposure of patients with MS to siponimod since the development program's inception on <ref type="bibr">March 5, 2009</ref>, until the cut-off date of May 31, 2017, was estimated to be 4048.6 patient-years (PY).</p><p>The 120-day Safety Update contained additional safety information available through December 31, 2017. The submission provided updates of AEs and safety findings in the only ongoing study, A2304EP, as well as an update of the analyses in the entire safety data set and errata to the original NDA safety data. In this update, the cumulative exposure estimate was revised to 4619.8 PY. Presently, the A2304EP trial is the only ongoing trial of siponimod for any indication. The applicant included updated safety information regarding AEs and findings in this study in the 120-day safety update.</p><p>The following table further summarizes patient exposure to siponimod in the controlled clinical trials undertaken in autoimmune patients in this application.  Source: Tabular listing of all clinical studies, NDA 209884 *Patients in these trials would crossover from placebo to siponimod treatment; thus, the same patients are included in both the siponimod and placebo treatment population n.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Pharmacology Studies</head><p>The applicant reported twenty clinical pharmacology studies.</p><p>Study A2126 was added to assess single dose bioavailability of siponimod. In these twenty studies, a total of 1281 subjects were enrolled. There were 880 healthy subjects, 24 hepatic impaired subjects and 8 renal impaired subjects who received siponimod and 434 healthy subjects who received placebo or placebo followed by siponimod. Some subjects sequentially received placebo and siponimod. In addition, 363 healthy subjects were exposed to other study drugs either alone or in combination with siponimod. The clinical pharmacology studies included in this application are presented in the following table. Reviewer Comment: Single dose and multiple dose trials in healthy volunteers are of limited clinical utility for generalization to an indicated population. There were no deaths and few SAEs reported in any of these trials. Review of the safety findings in these clinical pharmacology programs failed to reveal significant or new safety findings that were not identified in controlled or open label trials in patients with MS or other autoimmune diseases. Studies in other autoimmune diseases are reviewed in <ref type="bibr">Sections 8.4.4. and 8.4.5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Population Definition</head><p>The applicant defined the safety set population as follows: The maintenance dose, 2 mg by mouth daily, begins on Day 6 following successful titration. For patients with the CYP2C9 *1*3 or *2*3 genotypes, the maintenance dose was 1 mg by mouth once daily.</p><p>The applicant submitted four safety pools, as had been agreed upon in a pre-NDA meeting, as follows:</p><p>Safety Database 1 (N=1941 total, n=1134 siponimod treatment, n=607 placebo treatment), the Controlled Pool, includes patients in the placebo-controlled, double-blind phases of studies A2304 and A2201 and assesses safety in controlled conditions as compared to placebo. Data Data collected during the treatment period when patient was treated with siponimod 2 mg or 10 mg in the core (controlled and open-label) and/or extension phases of Studies A2201 and A2304, including A2304 CP open-label siponimod treatment, if any. Data collected during the dose titration up to the target dose prior to period (a) above. Data collected after a dose reduction from siponimod 2 mg to 1 mg (permitted per protocol due to low lymphocyte counts or tolerability). Similarly, for patients who received the 10 mg dose and then switched to 2 mg (and subsequently from 2 mg to 1 mg dose), data collected while receiving reduced dose. Data collected during a 30-day follow-up period after last dose of study drug are included.</p><p>Safety Database 3 (N=1545), Titration Pool, includes data from the initiation of siponimod and up-titration period. The titration pool includes patient data in the titration periods (up to 15 days) when patients underwent dose titration to siponimod 2 mg at dose initiation or at a later point in the core and/or extension portion of studies A2201 and A2304. Safety database 3 includes patients who underwent dose titration from no-treatment or placebo to siponimod 2 mg either at dose initiation in the core and/or extension phases of studies A2201 and A2304 or during dose restart after an interruption of 4 days or more. Patients from Study A2201 receiving siponimod 2 mg in core phase without titration and titrated up to siponimod 2 mg in the extension phase are included for the periods when they had dose titration only. That is, there are 29 patients from Study A2201 included in the titration pool, 7 of these patients at the time of dose initiation data and 23 at the time of dose restart data.</p><p>In Safety Database 3, the applicant defined dose initiation and dose restart to siponimod 2 mg as follows:</p><p>"Dose initiation to siponimod 2 mg: the first titration for a patient receiving the siponimod 2 mg dose, regardless if the first titration to siponimod 2 mg for that patient occurred during double-blind, dose-blinded, or open-label treatment and regardless of previous treatment with (or titration to) siponimod doses other than 2 mg (or placebo). This pool does not include patients who received the first siponimod 2 mg dose without "Dose restart to siponimod 2 mg: patients who missed treatment for ≥ 4 consecutive days were to have dose titration upon restarting treatment. If a patient took the first siponimod 2 mg dose without titration, any subsequent titration periods up to siponimod 2 mg are considered dose restart and are therefore included in this pool regardless of whether the titration occurred during double-blind, dose-blinded, or openlabel treatment and regardless of previous treatment with (or titration to) siponimod doses other than 2 mg or placebo). Dose restarts after interruption of 4 days or more include: restarting siponimod after stopping/completing the Core Part of A2304 and then receiving siponimod in the extension of A2304 (majority of dose restarts), and restarting siponimod after interruption, related to e.g. safety event or per protocol." Safety Database 4 (N=1737), Long-term Safety Pool, includes data exposure while on any lower doses of siponimod in addition to exposure while on siponimod 2 mg or higher (up to 10 mg). This safety database includes data collected during the siponimod treatment period with any dose, provided the patient received at least one dose of siponimod 2 mg or 10 mg. This includes the period when patients from Study A2201 were receiving siponimod 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1.25 mg or 10 mg prior to switching to siponimod 2 mg. Controlled double-blinded, open-label, and open-label extension data are included in this pool. This database is based on Safety Databases 1, 2, and 3.</p><p>Note: Safety Databases 2 and 4 include the same patients (all patients receiving at least one dose of siponimod 2 mg or higher) but for different exposure periods. Safety Database 2 encompasses the longest duration of siponimod exposure. In tables, data originating from Safety database 2 are indicated with *, and data originating from Safety Database 4 with **.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The pooling strategy was discussed in advanced of the submission and agreed to by the Agency. Given the differences in durations and doses between the controlled trials, the existence of several pools of subjects was appropriate. While all four pools are relevant, this reviewer found Safety Databases 1 and 2 to be the most informative because these databases contained all controlled and open label data for exposures across the whole range of doses in the MS trial program for the longest time interval available for review. Tables in this document will refer to the safety database used to generate the findings.</p><p>The table below summarizes exposure by duration in trials enrolling patients with MS and supports the assertion that exposure within the development programs for MS exceeded ICH guidelines (100 patients on treatment for at least 1 year). These data include safety data provided in the 120-day safety update.  The following table summarizes the durations of exposures at the doses used in MS development program. These data incorporate the safety data provided in the 120-day safety update: Considering all exposed patients with MS in the Safety Set, the mean age was 38.5 years (range 19 -61 years), 62.3% of the patients were women and 95.5% of the patients were white. These findings are consistent with the reported worldwide demographics of MS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">5</ref> The following table summarizes the demographic baseline characteristics for all patients (including all patients with MS exposed) included in the updated siponimod safety database. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adequacy of the safety database:</head><p>In the 120-day safety update, the applicant identified a total of 888 patients exposed to any dose of siponimod for ≥ 365 days. The submitted patient exposure data therefore demonstrate that siponimod exposure exceeded the ICH Guidelines for chronically administered medications (i.e., n=100 for one year). The siponimod safety database is of adequate size with a sufficient number of patients treated for an appropriate duration to generate meaningful conclusions regarding safety risks.</p><p>The applicant intends to recommend a titration schedule followed by a single daily dose (1 or 2 mg) based on genotype in their proposed labeling. Most of the subjects in the MS trials received doses of 2 mg.</p><p>There are practical limitations to the database due to disease predilections resulting in small numbers of exposed men and very few patients from racial groups other than white. Due to study design enrollment criteria and disease characteristics, less than half of the enrolled patients are &lt; 31 or &gt; 45 years old. Nevertheless, the demographic characteristics of the applicant's safety database patient population are similar to the intended treatment population, patients with MS. Therefore, the safety database is adequate and sufficient for the </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Issues Regarding Data Integrity and Submission Quality</head><p>The safety data provided by the applicant are of sufficient quality to permit a review. A data fitness assessment by the Agency's Office of Computational Science concluded that the datasets submitted for review were substantially complete and found few examples of duplicated, inconsistent, or missing data. The applicant responded appropriately to all queried issues with the submitted data sets in their responses to several of the Agency's Information Requests and apprised the Agency promptly of all database issues that arose during the review period.</p><p>During the review, I was able to replicate the key findings of the summaries provided by the applicant as presented in the Safety Set. For individual patients, I compared data across several sources and did not find gross discrepancies between datasets, narratives, supplied CRFs, listing, or summary tables. The applicant provided timely responses to requests for information and clarifications.</p><p>A database integrity issue became apparent during review. The applicant reported an issue with database access at multiple sites. An investigation by the Office of Scientific Integrity found that there were 62 clinical sites (out of 294 total clinical sites) in which site personnel were granted and had inappropriate access to the first dose or main databases affecting 247 out of 1651 total study subjects. This access involved: 34 users of the main database who had inappropriate access to the first dose database potentially affecting 101 subjects; These users were part of the main study team which included the clinical investigators who assess the time 25-foot walk test. 12 EDSS raters who were granted and had inappropriate access to the first dose or main databases 3 EDSS raters had inappropriate access to the first dose database for 13 subjects 9 EDSS raters had inappropriate access to the main database for 57 subjects The details of this inappropriate access are described further in the Clinical Review of Efficacy by Dr. David Jones and in the OSI review.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The implications of the inappropriate database access with regards to the safety database appear less concerning than they are for the efficacy review. While it is theoretically possible that providing study investigators with a means of violating the blinding to treatment status and knowing patient assignments might lead to underreporting of AEs for siponimod, there is no evidence of systematic deficiencies in  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Study A2304</ref>. Also, the pooling of safety data from multiple controlled studies should provide a broad sampling of data from studies not impacted by this database access issue and would supply evidence of safety issues missed, for whatever cause, in a compromised study. It is this reviewer's opinion that there are no obvious quantitative nor qualitative differences between the safety findings in Study A2304 and the safety findings from the other studies included in the safety database to suggest any evidence of malfeasance or suppression of safety data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Categorization of Adverse Events</head><p>The applicant used common definitions of AEs and SAEs. The applicant's coding process for verbatim AE terms using MedDRA coded terms was adequate and allowed for accurate estimates of event risks. The applicant's assessment of AEs, and AEs of special interest were also adequate and appropriate.</p><p>The protocol definition of an "adverse event" was "any untoward medical occurrence (i.e., any unfavorable and unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom, or disease) in a subject or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study. Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product." Investigators solicited AEs by questioning of the patients at each visit during the studies. Patients could also volunteer AEs during or between visits.</p><p>Laboratory test results physical examinations, and other study assessments could be sources for AEs as well. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constituted AEs only if they fulfilled at least one of the following criteria: they induced clinical signs or symptoms they were considered clinically significant they required therapy</p><p>The study protocols defined clinically notable laboratory findings according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Investigators recorded AEs in the Adverse Events CRF under the signs, symptoms or diagnosis associated with them accompanied by the following information:</p><p>CTCAE grade (If CTCAE grading does not exist for an adverse event, use 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, and 4=life-threatening. CTCAE Grade 5 (death) is not used, but is The study protocols defined an SAE as any adverse event (appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing) undesirable sign(s), symptom(s) or medical conditions(s)) which meets any one of the following criteria:</p><p>is fatal or life-threatening results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless hospitalization is for:</p><p>o routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition o elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent o treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission o social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the patient's general condition o is medically significant, i.e. defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</p><p>The protocols stipulated that investigators denote all malignant neoplasms as "serious" under "medically significant" if other seriousness criteria were not met.</p><p>The protocols instructed all investigators to treat all adverse events appropriately. Treatment could include one or more of the following: no action taken (i.e., further observation only); study treatment dosage interrupted; study drug permanently discontinued; concomitant medication given; non-drug therapy given. Investigators recorded the action taken to treat the adverse event on the Adverse Event CRF. Once an adverse event was detected, investigators were to follow the AE until it was resolved or until it was judged to be permanent. Investigators were instructed to assess AE progress should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study treatment, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome.</p><p>Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drug were found in the Investigator Brochure (IB) or were communicated between IB updates in the form of Investigator Notifications. This information was included in the patient informed consent, and investigators discussed these side effects with the patients during the study as needed.</p><p>The investigators instructed each patient to report any new AE (beyond the protocol observation period) that the patient, or the patient's personal physician, believed might be related to study treatment. This information was recorded in the investigator's source documents; however, if the AE met the criteria of a serious adverse event, it had to be reported to the applicant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Serious Adverse Events</head><p>To ensure patient safety, the protocols for the MS trials in this application stated that every serious adverse event (SAE), regardless of causality, occurring after the patient had provided informed consent and until 30 days after the last study visit must be reported to the applicant within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Investigators reported any SAEs experienced after the 30 day-period to the applicant only if the investigator suspected a causal relationship to study treatment.</p><p>Investigators had to report recurrent episodes, complications, or progression of the initial SAE as follow-ups to the original episode, regardless of when the event occurred. Investigators had 24 hours to submit follow-up reports after receiving the follow-up information. Any SAE that an investigator considered completely unrelated to a previously reported SAE were reported separately as new events.</p><p>Investigators collected information about all SAEs and recorded the data on the Serious Adverse Event Report Form. The reporting investigators had to complete all applicable sections of the form to provide a clinically thorough report. The reporting investigator assessed the relationship of each SAE to each specific component of the study treatment and submitted the completed form within 24 hours to the applicant. Detailed instructions regarding the submission process and requirements for signature were in the investigator folders provided to each site.</p><p>Investigators submitted follow-up information as instructed in the investigator folder. They reported each reoccurrence, complication, or progression of the original event as a follow-up to that event regardless of when the event had occurred. The follow-up information described whether the event had resolved or continued, if and how it had been treated, whether the blind had been broken, and whether the patient continued or withdrew from study participation.</p><p>If there was no prior documentation of the SAE in the Investigator's Brochure or Package Insert (new occurrence) and was thought to be related to the investigational treatment, a Drug Safety and Epidemiology Department associate urgently required further information from the investigator for Health Authority reporting. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) were collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with directives or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MS Relapses</head><p>MS relapses were one of the efficacy endpoints in the A2201 and A2304 studies; hence MS relapses were exempt from SAE reporting although they may have met the SAE definition on the basis that they are considered medically significant and are frequently associated with hospitalization. Investigators reported these events on the MS relapse electronic Case Report Form instead of the SAE form. However, if, in the judgment of the investigator, a MS relapse was unusually severe or medically unexpected and warranted specific notification, then an SAE form was completed and submitted.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The inclusion of MS relapses as a SAE creates potential difficulties in interpreting findings in the safety analysis because patients with MS will experience relapses of varying severity regardless of treatment. The compromise of allowing the investigators to include them base on clinical judgment if the relapse represented an unusual event appears appropriate. One specific concern for a safety database of a S1P modulator is that patients withdrawing from the S1P modulator fingolimod can experience severe exacerbations of disability and lesion number and therefore capturing these events for this S1P modulator is potentially meaningful.</p></div>

Given concerns about safety issues regarding bradycardia and cardiac conduction block associated with fingolimod that were noted in previous trials with siponimod, the Study A2304 protocol allowed the first half of the overall patient population to undergo extensive cardiac monitoring in order to collect comprehensive treatment initiation data in patients with previously normal cardiovascular status. In the second half of the study, patients with normal cardiovascular status had a less rigorous assessment.</p><p>Patients who had any of the following abnormalities had to undergo expanded cardiovascular monitoring to enter Study A2304. The "expanded cardiac monitoring" process was as follows:</p><p>On Days 1 and 7 of the initiation of therapy, after the patient has been sitting for five minutes, with their back supported and both feet placed on the floor, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured three times using an automated validated device (manual sphygmomanometer was used if automated device is not available at the study site). The repeat sitting measurements of blood pressure and pulse were made at one or two-minute intervals.</p><p>Patients had pre-dose electrocardiogram assessments on Days 1 and 7. Additionally, patients received mobile heart rate monitoring with telemetry, or a device with similar (or better) registration capability, for continuous registration of heart rate and cardiac events, minimally 6 hours post-dose, for expanded cardiac monitoring patients during their outpatient phase of the siponimod titration period. If mobile cardiac telemetry was not possible, patients were required to wear a Holter on the day of screening, Day 1 and Day 4 for 24 hours and for 6 hours on Day 7. The patients who wore a Holter had monitoring start 30 minutes prior to siponimod intake on each day of monitoring.</p><p>The Data Monitoring Committee subsequently confirmed that, based on the available treatment initiation cardiac monitoring results from the expanded cardiac monitoring patients, the 6-hour first dose cardiac monitoring (on Days 1 and 7) in subjects with normal cardiovascular status could be discontinued. The DMC supported continued data capture with mobile cardiac telemetry and Holter monitoring in all patients to facilitate the assessment of any relevant events occurring during treatment initiation.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The Division agreed to waiving the 6-hour cardiac monitoring on Days 1 and 7 in subjects with normal cardiovascular status based on the DMC recommendation and data submitted by the applicant as part of a protocol amendment to Study A2304. The applicant's proposed labeling reflects the absence of a need for monitoring normal cardiovascular status patients.</p></div>

Therefore, siponimod therapy will be consequentially associated with a higher risk of infection. A case of urosepsis in a patient with recent recurrence of a urinary tract infections associated with self-catheterization suggests possible antibiotic resistant bacteria which would complicate treatment. A more significant concern is the use of rituximab on the same day as the discontinuation of siponimod therapy. It is likely that rituximab had achieved its maximum effects on immune suppression at 72 days, but it highly unlikely that siponimod's effects would be present at 72 days after discontinuation. The administration of rituximab on the day siponimod therapy ended raises the possibility that the lymphocyte recovery expected in this patient did not occur or was blunted by rituximab and fostered conditions favorable for urosepsis due to a partially treated infection acquired on Day 50. The second case, septic shock in the setting of metastatic colon cancer is equally difficult to assign an association with study therapy. The patient in the second case discontinued siponimod 5 days before death, an inadequate duration in which to expect significant lymphocyte count recovery. The advanced nature of the colon cancer would compromise all aspects of care and foster conditions favorable to sepsis. It is possible siponimod reduced immune surveillance and had a role in cancer progression, but there is a positive family history and history of irritable bowel which are independent risk factors for colon cancer. Therefore, while an association with siponimod cannot be ruled out in either case, there are significant historical and medical factors in both cases that could predispose to sepsis and would provide risk of mortality independent of siponimod therapy.</p></div>

At the time of screening, the patient was an active smoker and had been smoking an average of 22 cigarettes per day for 30 years. There was a family history of coronary artery disease. On Day 29 of 1.25 mg siponimod treatment, the patient experienced severe retrosternal chest pain. The event (chest pain) persisted leading to permanent discontinuation of the study medication on Day 52. The patient was found dead in his apartment on Day 79, 27 days after the study medication was discontinued. The investigator mentioned that the patient was last seen by study personnel on Day 57; however, he did not wait for the treating physician to evaluate him. The investigator indicated that cardiac arrest could be a possible cause of death. The coroner's report concluded the reason for death as acute myocardial insufficiency. The patient's coronary arteries had stenosis of 75% and 85% in the circumflex and anterior descending artery respectively. The patient's brain imaging showed anoxic ischemic encephalopathy and MS plaques. The toxicology screen was negative. The investigator's conclusion was "probably exacerbation by study drug of underlying premature coronary artery disease leading to angina and subsequent death by myocardial infraction and arrest as the angina symptoms began while the patient was on study medication and is known to cause potential arteriolar vasoconstriction." The applicant's overall medical conclusion was that the events may be explained by the patient's coronary artery disease. Smoking and family history were identified risk factors for myocardial infarction. A causal relationship with study drug cannot be excluded for the event retrosternal chest pain that occurred when the patient was on study drug.

Death due to lung cancer in a patient with a chronic smoking history is unlikely to be primarily due to study treatment, but one cannot exclude the possibility of a reduction in the circulating lymphocyte pool yielding an increased risk of skin malignancy due to diminished immune surveillance. The mechanism for this increased skin lesion frequency is conjectured to be related to reduced lymphocyte counts leading to lower rates of surveillance for malignant cells, and siponimod's labeling will address this known increased risk of skin malignancy. While the cause of death is officially unknown for the third case, the patient was diagnosed with a potentially fatal condition, testicular cancer, four months prior to his death, and thus it is plausible that the cause of death may have been related to the cancer. Increased rates of cancer would be expected with reduced serum lymphocyte counts because of reduced immune surveillance for cancerous cells.</p><p>Reference ID: 4409498 </p><formula xml:id="formula_13">(b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) (b) (6) Clinical</formula></div>

As demonstrated in <ref type="bibr">Section 8.4.5</ref>., there was not an obvious mismatch in frequency of suicidal ideation and behavior in patients in the siponimod (8.2%) versus placebo treatment (8.7%) groups. Depression frequency in the siponimod treatment group was similar at randomization and reported depressive symptom frequency was slightly lower during the trial as compared to the placebo treatment group frequencies. The patient's reported worsening depression and recent initiation of citalopram to treat this exacerbation of depression are significant risk factors for suicide. Citalopram has a Boxed Warning regarding increased suicidality risk during initiation of treatment. A relationship to siponimod cannot be ruled out but other known suicide risk factors are present.</p></div>

I review narratives for select SAEs that were common and appeared more frequently with siponimod or for infrequent, unexpected SAEs that may be of concern.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The applicant provided two databases for SAEs. One database included only SAEs that occurred within a 30-day cut-off date of the double-blind phase and another that included any SAEs during the core phase of the study, irrespective of a cut-off date, until a patient entered open label therapy or discontinued therapy. There were seven additional SAEs in siponimod-treated patients and four additional SAEs in placebo-treated patients in the database that included all events until patients entered open label therapy or discontinued. The analysis in this review is derived from this larger, more inclusive database. The overall findings and conclusions from the 30-day cutoff database were consistent with those that were recorded until the end of follow-up or start of open label therapy, and the larger database did not reveal a safety finding not present in the smaller database pool. The half-life of siponimod is approximately 36 hours. It is therefore expected that after 5 half-lives, or approximately 7.5 days, that adverse events directly attributable to siponimod therapy would be diminished markedly. Therefore, the difference in event rates between a database with a strict 30day cut-off and a database including would not be expected to be markedly different. It is worth noting, however, that some effects of siponimod, e.g., reduced serum white cell count, may still be resolving at 30 days which obligates that a review of safety data be based on the database with the longest possible duration of observation to account for any SAEs that occurred in patients discontinuing therapy that would be missed by a strict 30-day cutoff.</p><p>The number SAEs in at least 2 patients in any treatment group in the controlled studies are presented in the following table. In siponimod treatment groups, the SOC with the most frequently reported SAEs was the Nervous System Disorders SOC (40 patients, 3.5%), and the most frequently reported SAEs within this SOC were seizures and related terms (10 patients, 0.9%).

The presence of serious MS relapses in the placebo treatment group is not surprising. There were more arrhythmiarelated SAEs in siponimod treatment, an anticipated outcome based on S1P modulator's known cardiac effects. Trigeminal neuralgia is a known, common symptom of MS occurring in approximately 5% of patients with MS and its overrepresentation in the treatment group is puzzling but given the lifetime prevalence of this symptom in MS, a 0.3% rate is within the expected frequency independent of treatment effects. Cerebrovascular events, e.g., strokes and transient ischemic attacks, are present at higher frequencies in siponimod-treated patients and are discussed below. Other findings appeared balanced in frequency between siponimod and placebo treatment. </p></div>

Analysis of Safety Database 3, which include SAEs captured during titration to a goal dose of siponimod, revealed few SAEs. There were few SAEs recorded during the 5-day titration periods. The most common SAEs were confined to the Cardiac Disorders SOC (11 patients, 0.7%), and the most common SAE was bradycardia (0.4%). Notes: Treatment-emergent serious adverse events occurred during titration period (up to 15 days) of dose initiation or dose restart are reported. A patient with multiple serious adverse events within a primary system organ class is counted only once in the total row. A patient with multiple occurrences of an SAE under one treatment is counted only once in this SAE category for that treatment. System organ classes are presented in alphabetical order; preferred terms are sorted within system organ class in descending frequency of SAEs based on siponimod 2mg.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: SAEs during titration of siponimod occurred for &lt;2% of all patients. The most common SAEs were cardiovascular in origin, but I would include the case of syncope as being related to cardiovascular effects in this sampling. The observed SAE frequencies confirm that immediate cardiovascular effects of siponimod acting at cardiac S1P receptors predominate during initial administration despite the therapy's targeted selectivity for non-cardiac S1P receptors. The overall rate of serious adverse events is significantly reduced compared to prior trials without titration. However, the presence of Cardiac Disorder SAEs during titration indicates that titration is not entirely successful at mitigating risk of Cardiac Disorders SAEs including, but not limited to, atrioventricular block. It is worth noting that one case of symptomatic first-degree AV block led to siponimod discontinuation, but other cases of first-degree blockade rectified spontaneously without permanent discontinuation of siponimod. The two cases of AV second degree AV block noted in the titration period occurred in patients who were in the higher risk cardiac monitoring group and following guidelines in proposed labeling would capture these cases in general use. There were no cases of second-degree block in patients without cardiac risk factors, and thus the titration scheme does appear to mitigate risks of serious conduction blockade in the routine cardiac risk patients. The applicant's proposed labeling for first dose monitoring, which recommends more monitoring for patients with histories of cardiac disease, appears to mitigate the cardiac risks associated with initiation of siponimod.</p></div>

The most frequently reported SAE associated with siponimod therapy were Cardiac Disorders (3.3%), specifically, second degree AV block reported in four patients (2.2%).</p><p>The following table describes all SAEs experienced by patients with RMS in the A2201 controlled trial portion (Periods 1 and 2). There were no SAEs associated with the 0.25 mg dose of siponimod, and thus this dose is not reported in the table. Reviewer Comment: Period 1 of Study A2201 did not employ a titration schedule used in Period 2 of this trial. The overall higher frequency of cardiac events reflects this lack of titration. Otherwise, the SAE database for this trial in patients with RMS is largely consistent with the SAE findings in the larger trial in patients with SPMS, Study A2304. There are fewer urinary tract infections in this database possibly indicative of there being fewer patients with urinary outflow compromise because relapsing MS does not feature this symptom as frequently. It is reassuring that the SAE frequency and type in this study population with RMS have similar characteristics to SAE findings from a trial population with SPMS because of the clinical overlap between these diseases and the high likelihood </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Controlled Pool</head><p>In the controlled phases of clinical trials in MS, patients treated with any dose of siponimod reported TEAEs more often (88.7%) than patients in the placebo treatment arm (81.4%).</p><p>Patients receiving siponimod 10 mg reported the highest frequency of adverse events (96.0%) among siponimod-treated patients, and there appeared to be evidence of a dose-dependent increase in most AEs with siponimod. Adverse events requiring concomitant therapy were reported in over half of patients (67.6%), but adverse events leading to study drug interruption   For patients receiving siponimod in controlled trials, the highest incidences of TEAEs came from the Infections and Infestations and Nervous System Disorders SOCs. The largest disparities between siponimod-treated patients and placebo-treated patients were an 8% difference in the incidence of TEAEs in the Investigations SOC and a 4% difference in the frequency of TEAEs in the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC.     68 (5.1%) 63 (5.5%) 42 (6.9%) Source: adae.xpt joined to adsl.xpt 1 includes all preferred terms related to infections of any type or source 2 includes upper respiratory tract infection, upper respiratory infection, nasopharyngitis 3 includes falls, dizziness, gait disturbance, balance disturbance, difficulty walking 4 includes blood pressure increased 5 includes all preferred terms referencing infectious with a viral etiology 6 includes asthenia, fatigue, malaise, weakness 7 includes increased hepatic enzymes, increased AST/ALT/GGT 8 includes all preferred terms that are cardiac arrhythmias 9 includes dizziness and light-headedness 10 includes peripheral and other forms of edema but not angioedema <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">11</ref>  Reviewer Comment: Despite a great deal of parity between the siponimod and placebo groups, this pooled analysis of most common preferred terms for TEAEs draws out some critical differences between siponimod and placebo TEAEs. Overall, this analysis demonstrates that the infection rate for all infections and for urinary tract infections specifically is approximately balanced, or even favors placebo, between the siponimod and placebo treatment groups. However, as expected based on reductions of circulating CD4+/CD8+ cells, viral infections were slightly more common in siponimod-treated patients. Influenza was more frequently reported in the placebo treatment group which was an unexpected finding because with another S1P modulator, influenza was more common than placebo. A customized grouped term for falls and disrupted balance was approximately 2% different between siponimod treatment and placebo treatment groups, and dizziness was increased 2% suggesting that siponimod is associated with more frequent falls because of more frequent dizziness or light-headedness. Finally, this analysis conforms that edema, headaches, and gastrointestinal symptoms will need to be highlighted as common mild symptoms associated with siponimod therapy as part of the clinical trial experience just as these symptoms were noted at similarly higher frequencies than placebo in the fingolimod development program.</p></div>

The most often reported TEAEs were headache (5.8%), dizziness (3.9%), bradycardia (3.9%), and nausea (3.6%). In the overall study population, the incidence of TEAEs was highest on Day 1 both for siponimod and placebo <ref type="bibr">(14.2% vs. 11</ref>.2%, respectively) and Day 7 (6.9% vs. 6.4%, respectively).

The only case (0.07%, 1/1545) of atrioventricular block second degree (Mobitz II) was recorded in a patient in whom the disorder was present prior to commencing study treatment and consequentially had been placed into the High-Risk Cardiac group for monitoring purposes.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: Given the short duration of titration and known effects of siponimod and S1P modulators on the heart, it is not surprising that bradycardia was a common event in the titration pool. Headache was not unexpected given the high headache frequency (~15%) observed in the controlled trials database, but dizziness appears to be an early, frequently reported TEAE. TEAEs in the Infections and Infestations SOC are not as prominent here because the lymphopenic effects of siponimod are beginning during titration but will not be fully realized in magnitude nor outcome in 7 days.</p></div>

Fingolimod treatment yielded a mean reduction in absolute neutrophils of -0.73 as compared to the decrease noted with siponimod of -0.45; this reduction is not predicted to create a clinically significant neutropenia, and there were no cases of neutropenia (&lt;0.5x10 9 neutrophils/L) reported in the controlled patient pool. A small decrease in platelet count (with large variability) was noted with fingolimod and is noted with siponimod treatment; this small decrease in circulating platelets is of uncertain clinical significance but did not appear to predispose to bleeding diatheses. Siponimod appeared to increase likelihood of CTCAE Grade 1-2 anemic events without a difference in transfusion or life-threatening events; a hemoglobin shift analysis did not demonstrate a difference between siponimod from placebo treatments. The percent change in the subtypes of lymphocytes from baseline are shown in the following table: Reviewer Comment: The decrease in total white blood cell counts associated with siponimod therapy appears driven largely by a reduction in lymphocytes and, more specifically, by an approximate reduction of <ref type="bibr">70% and 90% in CD8+ and CD4+ lymphocytes,</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> respectively. An approximate 10% decline in absolute neutrophil count occurs with high variability. The reduction in lymphocytes is a likely explanation for the increased risk of infection noted in these studies, and the large decline in CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts are risk factors for the appearance of opportunistic infections and the reactivation of latent infections. The decreased absolute basophil count is of unclear clinical significance and had been noted in association with fingolimod therapy. See <ref type="bibr">Section 8.5.1</ref>. for further discussion of lymphopenia. Lymphocyte Recovery Limited numbers of patients in the controlled portion of trials in MS were observed after discontinuation of siponimod for recovery of lymphocyte counts.

Recovery appears to continue through and beyond 4 weeks post-discontinuation. It is unclear which lymphocytes are released from lymph node reserves and whether there are deficiencies in subpopulations of lymphocytes that exist during or after restoration of normal range total white blood counts because there were no investigations after discontinuation of lymphocyte subtypes beyond neutrophils. In fingolimod, there is a severe exacerbation of symptoms noted in a fraction of patients 3-6 months after discontinuation that is suspected to be related to lymphocyte count recovery.</p></div>

One potential concern would be that these findings are associated with a loss of muscle mass associated with progression of disability, but placebo-treated patients, who accumulated significant more disability, showed increased serum creatinine and decreased creatinine clearance which would not be expected with muscle atrophy. New onset of renal-related events as indicated by a new laboratory or clinical finding were largely balanced between the siponimod and placebo treatment groups, suggesting that siponimod is not associated with renal pathology that is producing a total breakdown in filtration capacity.

Reviewer Comment: Siponimod exposure reduces patients' heart rates, with 462 out of 1737 (26.6%) patients exposed in the entire development program experiencing a new heart rate &lt; 60 BPM. The applicant claims that the titration schedule reduces symptomatic bradycardia, which appears to be the case as the overall rate of the AE of bradycardia was 4.8% in non-titrated patients versus 4.0% in the titration pool (see <ref type="bibr">Section 8.4.2 and 8.4.5</ref> for further discussion of bradycardia as an AE), but the titration schedule does not prevent new onset of bradycardia nor does it eliminate all risk of severe bradycardia and symptomatic bradycardia. Approximately 6% of patients who titrated to the 2 mg siponimod dose experienced new heart rates &lt; 50 BPM after titration, and there were two patients with symptomatic bradycardia events noted in successfully titrated patients. Therefore, the titration schedule appears to reduce the frequency of bradycardia, but bradycardia with symptoms still occurs in association with siponimod administration. For patients with histories of abnormal rhythms, there is a clear risk of exacerbating underlying cardiac issues, and for these patients first dose monitoring appears necessary.

MCT demonstrated that at the end of the first day of dose initiation, heart rate decreased by a mean of five-six beats per minute after the first dose, decreasing on subsequent days and finally reaching the maximum difference from baseline to minimum heart rate on Day 5. Thereafter, minimum mean hourly heart rate slowly increased.</p><p>The applicant performed a post hoc analysis of dose initiation MCT extreme heart rate data showed that the peak incidence of minimum heart rates of less than 50 BPM and less than 40 BPM occurred on Day 4 and Day 5, which corresponds to the maximum decrease from baseline. Newly detected minimum heart rates less than 40 BPM occurred in 6.8% of siponimod patients and in 1.8% of placebo patients. All patients with heart rates less than 40 BPM were asymptomatic. No heart rate less than 30 BPM was captured in any of the groups except one patient in the Expanded Cardiac Monitoring group with a history of previous treatment with mitoxantrone and pre-dose baseline bradycardia on MCT who experienced an asymptomatic HR of 20 BPM observed in the titration period.</p><p>There were no new Mobitz II atrioventricular blocks, no higher degree blocks, and no complete AV blocks observed by MCT in the siponimod group during dose initiation at any time after first dose. The incidence of Mobitz I AV block during dose initiation, based on MCT, was low and was not markedly different between the siponimod and placebo groups. Incidence of pauses defined as T ≥ 3 sec was low; there were 6 events (1.0%) in the Standard Cardiac Monitoring group and 1 event in Expanded Cardiac Monitoring group (0.4%) and none on placebo.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Controlled Phase</head><p>The number of patients with interpretable Holter data was low (&lt;20% of patients overall) which limits conclusions from Holter monitoring. However, Holter monitoring appeared to corroborate the more expansive MCT results in that the incidence of Mobitz type I atrioventricular block was low and similar between both siponimod and placebo treatment groups. No new incidences of second degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular blocks, higher degree block or complete AV blocks were recorded via Holter monitoring.</p><p>The incidence of Holter findings at any time post first dose was lower in the siponimod group relative to placebo in the Expanded Cardiac Monitoring group <ref type="bibr">(11.2% siponimod, 31.1% placebo)</ref> and higher in the Standard Cardiac Monitoring group in the siponimod group than placebo <ref type="bibr">(23.2% siponimod, 11.9% placebo)</ref>. Most of these findings were related to ectopy, such as frequent ventricular premature complexes (VPC) and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.</p><p>The following table provided by the applicant summarizes the findings captured by the MCT and ECG/Holter/ECG monitoring: Reviewer Comment: The titration did appear to eliminate second degree heart block as there were no new cases of symptomatic 2 nd degree AV block after titration was implemented. Extensive cardiac monitoring via MCT and Holter monitors did not elucidate more clinically relevant findings than ECG, and so ECG appears sufficient to capture the information needed to make decisions regarding continuing treatment. Given the similarity of siponimod to fingolimod, it is reasonable to assume that patients are at risk of significant cardiac rhythm disturbances with siponimod initiation. The dose titration instituted for siponimod does appear to mitigate risk for patients without a history of cardiac disease because the rates of any events in this group were low and the events that were present were obviously symptomatic or transient, and labeling can address these situations and ensure safety during initial dosing in most patients. Patients with a prior history of arrhythmia or cardiac disease should undergo first dose monitoring with a pre-and post-dose ECG. Because of the observed peak heart rate reduction noted on Day 1, a pre-treatment ECG and an ECG at 6 hours post-first dose are needed for high risk patients to address safety concerns associated with persistent 1 st degree AV block or persistent sinus bradycardia. Recommendations regarding symptomatic bradycardia, heart block, prolonged QTc interval, and interactions with other arrhythmia-inducing therapies should mirror fingolimod labeling as well.</p></div>

The primary objective of this TQT Study was "[t]o assess if the placebo-corrected, baseline-adjusted mean QTcF (ΔΔQTcF) at therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of siponimod exceeds the regulatory threshold level of concern of 5 milliseconds as evidenced by an upper bound of a one-sided 95% CI for the largest mean QTc effect of 10 milliseconds."</p><p>The applicant states that, "[the] thorough QT study at therapeutic (2 mg) and supratherapeutic (10 mg) doses demonstrated no significant direct QT prolonging effect of siponimod.

Antidrug antibodies have not been observed.</p><p>However, because siponimod lowers circulating numbers of lymphocytes, the potential effects of siponimod on the immune response/immunogenicity of selected vaccines were investigated in a dedicated study. Non-inferior responder rates demonstrated that concomitant siponimod treatment did not compromise the efficacy of a PPV-23 vaccination (T cell-independent response) and therefore no siponimod treatment interruption is required. The efficacy of quadrivalent influenza vaccination (T cell-dependent vaccine) is not compromised if siponimod treatment is paused 1 week prior until 4 weeks after vaccination.</p><p>Reviewer comment: The applicant has proposed language for how the findings of the immune response studies will be described in labeling.

Furthermore, a customized search pooling preferred terms related to all infection types demonstrated equivalence in pooled infection terms between patients treated with any siponimod dose and placebo. Urinary tract and upper respiratory infection frequencies were also similar between siponimod and placebo treatment groups in this custom analysis (see <ref type="bibr">Section 8.4.5.)</ref> Siponimod is associated with lymphopenia, and postmarketing experience with another S1P modulator revealed an association with reactivation of herpes viruses and opportunistic infections seen in the immune compromised state.

Fingolimod, an approved S1P modulator, causes persistent reductions in circulating lymphocyte numbers by the same mechanism. Therefore, it was expected that the serum absolute lymphocyte counts in patients would be reduced by siponimod therapy, and such was the case. For the long-term safety pools, absolute lymphocyte counts were reduced at Day 28 for siponimod at any studied dose and remained reduced from Day 28 until the latest follow-up recorded for patients who remained on therapy. In the siponimod 2 mg treatment group, the change from baseline in absolute lymphocytes counts was −1.227 x10 9 /L compared to +0.043 x10 9 /L for the placebo group at Day 28. The onset of the reduction can occur on Day 1 and peaks in Weeks 2-3 (see <ref type="bibr">Section 8.4.6.)</ref> Absolute lymphocyte count data were provided in the 120-day safety update for lymphocyte values up through Month 84, albeit with small numbers of subjects, and the mean reduction in circulating lymphocyte number remained approximately 1 x10 9 /L across the 84 weeks of monitoring.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 3</ref>.5-1.2 120-day Update SCS Almost all patients in the long-term safety pools reported "lymphocyte count decreased" (98.7%; all grades in the broadest long-term safety pool), the majority (73.2%) had CTCAE grade 3 (count &lt;0.5 -0.2 x10 9 /L lymphocytes.

The increased risk of infections caused by lymphopenia can be mitigated partially with labeling directed at prescribers and consumers warning for increased awareness of infection risk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bradycardia/Bradyarrhythmia</head><p>S1P modulators are associated with significant bradycardia and rhythm disturbances with initial dosing because of interaction with S1P1 receptors in cardiac muscle that mediate heart rate. In Study A2304, the applicant selected the siponimod dose of 2 mg daily and instituted a 6-day titration schedule to achieve this maintenance dose to reduce the frequency and risks of serious cardiac symptoms associated with first dose. In Period 1 of Study A2201, the doses of 0.5 mg, 2 mg, and 1 mg had been initiated without titration but due to bradyarrhythmic effects, later in Study 2201, titration schemes were implemented to mitigate the cardiac effects. All patients starting their initial exposure or restarting after a 4 day or longer interruption, would follow the same titration procedure as follows: On Day 1, patients were monitored in the clinic for at least the first six hours after taking the first dose of study drug (Day 1) with hourly heart rate and blood pressure measurements. Additionally, a surface 12 lead ECG was taken at three-and six-hours post-dose. After six hours of observation, patients could be discharged if the effect on heart rate was within pre-defined limits, the patient was asymptomatic, and the six-hour ECG did not show any new relevant abnormalities. Patients not meeting the per protocol predefined criteria had to be observed longer until criteria were met (even if it required overnight hospitalization). Patients were required to continue titration and return to clinic on Day 7 when the same observations as on Day 1 were performed for at least the first 6 hours after taking the Day 7 dose of study drug. , if use of MCT was not feasible at that particular site. To prevent unblinding, monitoring after the first intake of the study drug was performed under the responsibility of an independent physician referred to as the First Dose Administrator. This physician reviewed vital signs during 6-hour monitoring, post-dose ECG, assessed discharge criteria at 6 hours post-dose, and managed cardiac events when they occurred. The investigator/treating physician was informed of any SAEs that may have occurred, remaining otherwise blinded to the cardiac events happening on the first day.</p><p>Overall, as indicated in the following table, most cardiac conduction-related TEAEs of specific concern occurred within a week of initiation of siponimod therapy. As expected based on prior experience with other S1P modulators and findings in siponimod specifically in prior trials, bradycardia (4.4% siponimod, 2.6% placebo) and sinus bradycardia (1.3% siponimod, 0.2% placebo) were the most frequently reported TEAE in each treatment group from Days 1 to 7. In Study A2304, a search of the combined AE terms "bradyarrhythmia" and "bradycardia" revealed that 7.4% of patients in the siponimod treatment group and 2.9% in the placebo treatment group experienced reports of these events during dose initiation. Reviewer Comment: The expectation with titration was that bradycardia and related events would be reduced, which as discussed elsewhere appeared to be the outcome of titration. However, TEAEs related to bradycardia still occur at a higher rate than placebo and appear confined largely to the period immediately after initiation of therapy. One concern regarding the observed increased signal for falls and injuries was that patients would fall due to syncope. The two cases of syncope noted on  were not associated with falls or injuries. In both cases, ECGs obtained with the events showed no changes from baseline. The recurrent case of 1 st degree AV block noted in one patient was asymptomatic and resolved on subsequent ECGs. It appears that the titration makes persistent, high degree, AV block highly unlikely.</p><p>Patient symptoms reported during siponimod initiation occurred during first dose administration and were mild. Headache, fatigue and dizziness were the most common TEAEs reported in the siponimod 2 mg group on Day 1 of dose initiation, which were all reported at lower frequencies on Days 2-7. There were 15 patients (1.3%) in the siponimod 2 mg group in the Controlled Pool who discontinued due to bradyarrhythmia and bradycardia or related symptoms including hypotension and malaise. Out of these patients, 11 (1.0%) discontinued due to reports of bradyarrhythmia and bradycardia, five (0.4%) patients due to second degree AV block Mobitz I, two (0.2%) patients due to first degree AV block, and 4 (0.3%) due to bradycardia. There were no patients in the placebo treatment group who discontinued due to any of these cardiac AEs. Reviewer Comment: &gt;98% of reported symptom AEs were CTCAE 1-2. Fatigue and dizziness were discordant between treatment groups. Headache frequency was similar between the two groups. Dizziness appears to remain associated with siponimod treatment long-term whereas reports of fatigue and related terms are not markedly different between placebo and siponimod treated patients in the entire controlled pool database (see <ref type="bibr">Section 8.4.5.)</ref> Cardiac Risk Categorization In Study 2304 core phase and extension, patients were classified according to pre-existing cardiac risks including observations at screening.</p><p>A total of 1471 out of 1645 (89.4%) of patients had extensive cardiac monitoring at treatment initiation. This "Expanded Cardiac Monitoring" group was comprised of 358 patients (32.6%). Additionally, 628 patients (57.1%) of the Standard Cardiac Monitoring group also had extensive monitoring before implementation of a protocol amendment by which 6 hours post-dose monitoring on Day 1 and Day 7 was no longer required for patients with no cardiac risk (referred to as the "Standard Cardiac Monitoring" group). As summarized previously, the initial 0.25 mg dose of siponimod is associated with heart rate reduction. After first dose, siponimod was associated with a decline in sitting pulse on Day 1 that began as early as 1 hour after dosing, reaching its maximal decrease after 3-4 hours on Day 1. The maximal decline from pre-dose values in mean sitting pulse was −5.3 beats per minute. There is some reduction in the siponimod treatment effect on heart rate, but not total accommodation. On Day 7, when patients received their second dose of siponimod at the 2 mg maintenance dose, the maximal decline at 3 hours post-dose in the siponimod treatment group was a mean change of −3.08 beats per minute.</p><p>The reductions in sitting pulse observed at the initiation of siponimod treatment attenuated with chronic 2 mg treatment. In many patients, the heart rates return to baseline rates within 4 weeks of initiation (See Section 8.4.7.)  In Study A2304, during the first 7 days of treatment, 4.4% patients in the siponimod treatment group versus 2.6% patients in the placebo group reported bradycardia in a visit vital signs assessment. Bradycardia was reported in 51 (4.4%) patients treated with siponimod 2 mg in the first 3 months of treatment; bradycardia was reported for less than 1% of patients in each time interval after 3 months. In the placebo group, bradycardia was reported in 16 (2.6%) patients in the first 3 months and was not reported for any patients after 3 months.</p><p>An analysis of treatment emergent adverse events in Study A2304 showed a low frequency of bradycardic events in the titration period. In the first seven days of treatment, sinus bradycardia was reported in 1.3% of siponimod treated patients versus 0.2% placebo-treated patients. Sinus bradycardia was reported in 16 (1.4%) siponimod 2 mg patients in the first 3 months of treatment, and for zero patients each time interval after 3 months. In the placebo group, sinus bradycardia was reported in 3 (0.5%) patients in the first 3 months and in 2 (0.3%) patients in the greater than 12-month interval. In Study A2304, bradycardia and sinus   Macular edema was a SAE for 3 (0.3%) patients in the siponimod 2 mg treatment group and reported as a SAE in no other siponimod or placebo treated patients. There were 11 patients (1.0%) who discontinued siponimod 2 mg treatment and one patient who discontinued siponimod 10 mg because of macular edema.</p><p>A search for all TEAEs of macular edema using the broadest search terms yielded 21 cases across all doses of siponimod. Two of the cases in the 2 mg siponimod exposure group were coded as "cystoid" macular edema; these two cases are included among "macular edema (any)" events in the table below. Reviewer Comment: The current labeling for the approved non-specific S1P receptor modulator fingolimod includes a quoted frequency of 0.5% at the marketed dose of 0.5 mg meaning that the risk of macular edema associated with siponimod 2 mg (1.7%) is more than three-fold higher despite a claim of siponimod having greater S1P receptor selectivity to reduce, among other outcomes, increased vascular permeability (the surmised etiology of macular edema in exposed patients.)</p><p>Macular edema occurred most frequently <ref type="bibr">(14 patients out of 20)</ref> in the first four months after initiation of siponimod 2 mg (with no reported cases in the placebo population during the same duration of treatment), but some cases of macular edema TEAEs were reported to have onsets more than a year after start of siponimod therapy. The timing of onset for patients with new macular edema are described in the following  Reviewer Comment: In proposed labeling from the applicant, the applicant suggested a baseline ophthalmic examination Furthermore, in consultation with DTOP, it was their opinion that because every reported case of macular edema was symptomatic (most often, visual loss) Instead, the DTOP consultants suggested language for labeling that would direct patients to seek out urgent medical examination in response to any change in vision. This reviewer agrees that However, this reviewer still advocates for a baseline ophthalmological examination as being necessary to provide a baseline for future comparison and to identify other findings thus removing the possibility for uncertainty in a future examination if findings were present before therapy began.</p><p>The study protocol allowed for patients with a history of uveitis and diabetes mellitus, independent risk factors associated with increased risk of macular edema, to enroll in the A2304 trial. Of the 20 patients on siponimod 2 mg with an AE of macular edema, two patients (10%) who experienced macular edema had a medical history of diabetes mellitus or uveitis. In addition, there were three patients (15%) with AEs of macular edema which was preceded by a history of increased intraocular pressure, retinal detachment or diabetes mellitus. A patient in the 10 mg siponimod treatment condition had a prior history of uveitis and optic neuritis of the right eye and experienced an AE of macular edema.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The higher rates of macular edema noted in patients exposed to siponimod with histories of diabetes mellitus or uveitis would seem to suggest these predisposing factors substantially increase the risk of macula edema beyond the treatment effect of siponimod. Whether increase risk exists with the approved S1P modulator fingolimod is the subject of an ongoing postmarketing study and definitive results of this study are pending. Labeling proposed by the applicant described an increased risk in patients with uveitis and diabetes mellitus. The consultation from DTOP disagreed with the proposed labeling and disagrees with the conclusion that there is increased risk in these patient populations. This reviewer acknowledges the difficulties in interpreting safety data from three patients in these sub-populations who would have a higher risk regardless of treatment. This reviewer defers to the expert reviewer on this matter. The pending fingolimod trial results may provide some clarification of the risk for a similar therapy to inform labeling of siponimod.</p></div>

Asthma was the most common reported restrictive airway-related event in five patients (0.4%) in the 2 mg siponimod treatment group and in one patient (0.2%) in placebo treatment. None of the cough, asthma, bronchospasm, or bronchoconstriction AEs were reported as serious AEs. There was a single case of dyspnea listed as a SAE. There were two notable discontinuations due to Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal TEAEs in the controlled pool.

In the siponimod 2 mg treatment group, 9.2% of patients had FEV1 below 80% at any visit as compared to 6.4% of placebo patients. At 2 consecutive visits, 3.0% of siponimodtreated patients and 2.4% of placebo-treated patients had FEV1 values below 80% and 2 siponimod patients had FEV1 findings below 60%.</p><p>FVC results showed a similar reduction associated with siponimod treatment that peaked at 15 months of treatment. FEV1/FVC did not vary across 36 months for either the siponimod or placebo treatment groups. DLCO reductions were more variable than FEV1 and FVC reductions associated with siponimod therapy. DLCO changes below 80% compared to baseline at any visit were reported in 21.7% of siponimod and 10.9% placebo patients and DLCO changes below 60% of baseline values at any visit were reported in 3.6% of patients in the siponimod group and 1.8% of placebo patients. There were 69 (7.8%) siponimod-treated patients and 11 (2.5%) placebo patients who had DLCO values below 80% at 2 consecutive visits 3 months apart. Mean changes from baseline for absolute DLCO values (siponimod, placebo) were −0.4 and 0.6 mL/min/mmHg at Day 28, −1.5 and 1.6 mL/min/mmHg at Month 6, and −1.5 and 0.1 mL/min/mmHg at Month 12. There were no AEs obviously associated with the observed reductions in DLCO.  Reviewer Comment: There were more frequent reports of cough and dyspnea in patients treated with siponimod compared to placebo treated patients. The origin of these TEAEs appears to be related to siponimod-associated persistent reductions in FEV1 and FVC. The reduction in these respiratory parameters is greatest at 15 months of treatment and persist until at least 36 months. Whether these changes are permanent or return to baseline with discontinuation are not clear. On recommendation of the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Rheumatology Products (DPARP) consultants, a postmarketing study of these parameters will be requested to study this phenomenon and examine persistence of this airway restriction. Please see consult from DPARP regarding the pulmonary findings associated with siponimod.  The 120-day Safety Update included several new AEs of cough and dyspnea and one additional AE related to airway restriction. The updated summary of AEs is as follows: Reviewer Comment: The long-term safety data confirm that cough and dyspnea are common AEs associated with siponimod treatment and increase in frequency with longer treatment.</p></div>

It is assumed that the effects on blood vessel permeability that result from S1P exposure will yield some degree of elevated blood pressure regardless of how specific the S1P modulator may be. Controlled Pool At Month 6 there was a mean increase in systolic BP of +3.01 mmHg in the siponimod 2 mg group and a mean decrease of −0.84 mmHg in the placebo group. At Month 12 the mean increase in systolic BP was +3.73 mmHg in the siponimod 2 mg group and the mean decrease was −0.61 mmHg in the placebo group. After Month 12 through Month 30, the increase in mean systolic BP in the siponimod 2 mg group remained between +2.76 and +4 mmHg. There were small elevations in diastolic BP. At Month 6 there was a mean increase in diastolic BP of +1.27 mmHg in the siponimod 2 mg group and a mean decrease of −0.30 mmHg in the placebo group. At Month 12 the mean increase in diastolic BP in the siponimod 2 mg group was 1.36 mmHg and the mean decrease in the placebo group was −0.78 mmHg.

Notably high (&gt;90, &gt;100 or &gt;110 mmHg) diastolic BP was seen in similar percentages of patients in the siponimod 2 mg (24.5%, 6.8%, 0.9%) and placebo (24.6%, 6.8%, 0.5%) treatment groups.</p><p>In the Controlled Pool (Safety Database 1), more patients were noted with the TEAE of hypertension (based on the broadest risk search terms for "hypertension") in the siponimod 2 mg treatment group (140/1148 patients, 12.2%) than in the placebo treatment group (53/607, 8.7%). Hypertension AE reporting appeared to parallel the blood pressure changes (which were present by six months) with most AEs noted within 3-6 months of initiating treatment. Thereafter frequencies of hypertension AEs in both siponimod and placebo treatment groups declined and there was a trend toward systolic blood pressure elevations becoming smaller in magnitude but without a return to baseline.</p></div>

Hypertension is a known, modifiable risk factor of myocardial infarction and stroke. There are many therapies approved for the treatment of hypertension. A similar Warning and Precautions statement to inform consumers and prescribers of the risk of hypertension associated with siponimod is justified by the findings in the controlled and long-term safety data from the trials submitted in this application.</p></div>

A customized search performed by this reviewer focusing on cerebral and myocardial thrombotic events captured the same 34 AEs. Within these 34 events in the controlled pool safety database (Safety Database 1), there were seven TEAEs classified as ischemic cerebrovascular events (two transient ischemic attacks, one embolic stroke, four strokes) and two SAEs of myocardial infarction occurring in patients treated with siponimod. A broader search of the controlled pool safety database for TEAEs consistent with an acute thrombotic event yielded 34 TEAEs for patients in the siponimod 2 mg and placebo treatment groups in the Controlled Pool. There were no TEAEs related to thromboembolic searches in patients treated with 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1.25 mg, or 10 mg siponimod.</p><p>The following table summarizes the thrombotic adverse event findings: The odds ratios for thromboembolic events, hemorrhagic central nervous system events, and ischemic heart disease events, are 1.0 or less, arguing against a systemic higher risk of these events in association with siponimod therapy.

One of the cases of hemorrhagic central nervous system events was a subdural hematoma suffered secondary to a fall, and this narrative is included among the falls with serious injuries summarized in <ref type="bibr">Section 8.4.2.</ref> The central nervous system ischemic and arterial thrombotic events have no correlate in the placebo treatment group and would represent an estimated incidence rate of 2.0 per 100 PY for all events and 0.4 per 100 PY for strokes. Review of the narratives for these events suggests there were risk factors for strokes in most, but not all, cases.</p><p>Of the seven patients with ischemic cerebrovascular events, the two patients who experienced transient ischemic attacks had significant risk factors for stroke. One of these patients (Patient ) was being treated for longstanding hyperlipidemia. The other patient was taking medroxyprogesterone (which can predispose to stroke) for gynecological reasons, and after the transient ischemic attack, she experienced a deep vein thrombosis leading to discontinuation of therapy, strong evidence of a hypercoagulable state. Reviewer Comment: The rates of pre-existing hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus were balanced between siponimod and placebo treatment. Patent foramen ovale is an uncommonly found risk factor for stroke that would not be expected to be balanced between treatment groups. Therefore, four cases of stroke would remain unbalanced against no placebo patients.</p><p>The remaining patient had a stroke associated with two transient ischemic attacks (Patient ) beginning on Day 5 of siponimod therapy. There were no blood pressure readings for this patient that were hypertensive, and she had no preexisting medical conditions to raise her risk aside from her age (58 years old) and her diagnosis of MS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">13</ref> Reviewer Comment: A case of stroke with multiple TIAs during titration of siponimod is very concerning for an exposure associated risk of a significant medical event.</p></div>

There was an additional case of a patient with a seizure in the 0.25 mg treatment group. Reviewer Comment: This reviewer is very skeptical of the re-coding of these two events. There is an obvious visual difference between a seizure and leg cramps. The difference between these phenomena is sufficiently large to provide reasonable doubt that a trained medical professional would confuse these two clinically distinct events in two separate patients. The provided clinical reports do not provide sufficient detail to support a clear justification for the re-coding of these events as "leg cramps." The inclusion of these patients would not change this reviewer's conclusions regarding a possible association of siponimod with seizures.</p><p>Excluding the two patients whose seizures were apparently leg cramps, in the 17 patients receiving siponimod 2 mg with reported seizures and related events there were six patients who had a history of epilepsy reported in their medical histories and confirmed by prophylactic treatment with anticonvulsants, prior to commencing siponimod. A history of epilepsy could be an obvious confounding diagnosis for seizures, but it should be noted that the number of patients with histories of epilepsy at enrollment were balanced between the siponimod (16 patients, 1.4%) and placebo treatment (7 patients, 1.2%) groups, and, thus, given this preexposure balance, it is quite concerning that more patients experienced seizures in the siponimod treatment group than in the placebo condition.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: Two cases out of the remaining twelve cases are incorrectly coded. A patient experienced a TEAE of "epilepsy" reported two days following a stroke. The stroke provided a plausible etiology and timing for the reported seizure which was almost certainly a provoked ictal event and direct consequence of the stroke and thus not an "epileptic" event which, by definition, requires the cause to be idiopathic. Upon review of the report for the TEAE coded as "myoclonic epilepsy," this event appears to be miscoded because the incident was described as nocturnal ballistic movements in a patient with a history of restless leg syndrome in a patient without other convincing history of myoclonic epilepsy events.</p><p>Thus, excluding the two cases with apparent miscoding, there are nine patients (9/1334) who experienced their first seizures while receiving any siponimod treatment (0.7%, Odds Ratio=1.4 overall vs. the placebo treatment group.) If we add back the two patients with recoding of their events as leg cramps, the frequency would rise to nearly 0.8% and the Odds Ratio would rise to 1.6 vs. placebo treatment.</p><p>Less than half of the new onsets of seizures in these nine patients occurred within the first six months of treatment with siponimod. First seizures in non-epileptic patients occurred between Days 44 and 899 of treatment relative to initiation of siponimod. The distribution of events was as follows: These nine patients with new diagnosis of epilepsy during siponimod treatment continued in study with no further seizures reported. Seven of these patients were treated with an anticonvulsant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1-3 months: n=2</head><p>Reviewer Comment: Epilepsy is twice more common in the worldwide population of patients with MS than healthy peers, <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">14</ref> and seizures in patients with MS may have an incidence of over 5% or higher over a patient's lifespan. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">15</ref> The risk of a patient with MS being diagnosed with epilepsy increases with longer durations of MS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">15</ref> There were no gross imbalance between siponimod (1.4%) and placebo (1.2%) treatment groups with respect to patients who were enrolled with a pre-treatment diagnosis of epilepsy or seizures, and the ultimate difference in frequencies between groups, 0.2% matches the baseline imbalance between the two treatment groups. Furthermore, it is surprisingly nevertheless that the epilepsy incidence and prevalence reported in the literature <ref type="bibr">(up to 5%, and up to 7%, respectively)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">15</ref> are 5-fold higher than the enrollment baseline rates in both treatment groups (1.4% and 1.2%, respectively) and ten-fold more frequent than the observed frequencies of epilepsy in either treatment group. This disconnect between the reported and observed rates of epilepsy is recapitulated in other clinical trial databases of patients with MS, suggesting that either the published population rates of epilepsy are exaggerated or that the clinical trial population is not reflective of the general MS population with respect to epilepsy risk. Regardless, there is a mismatch with an Odds Ratio of approximately 2.0 favoring an association of siponimod with seizures. There is no clear mechanism for siponimod to promote seizure activity; S1P receptors are not known to be involved in epileptic kindling or seizure propagation. In fact, some reports suggest S1P modulation may prevent seizures in animal models of epilepsy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">17</ref> Half of the patients who experienced seizures in the siponimod group had a history of epilepsy, some notably refractory to treatment. Seizures are a stochastic event and the observed mismatch could be a statistical anomaly. Regardless of the data in this trial, seizures/epilepsy are common complications of MS. The applicant proposes labeling for fingolimod describes a possible association of seizure with similar event rates and on review similar concerns were raised with this other S1P modulator. This reviewer agrees with the applicant's labeling recommendation to report the seizure frequencies in the siponimod and placebo treatment groups within the description of the clinical trials experience. There is insufficient data presently to ascertain whether siponimod or S1P modulators in general are associated with epilepsy and disentangling this issue in the postmarketing setting would require a rigorous, longitudinal commitment by multiple applicants to determine whether a given treatment is associated with an increase or whether the demographics of epilepsy in MS that are published are not representative of the clinical trial populations.  Reviewer Comment: While the overall rate of suicide-associated TEAEs is balanced between the siponimod and placebo treatment groups, suicidal ideation, occurred significantly more often <ref type="bibr">(Odds Ratio=2.7)</ref> in patients in the 2 mg siponimod treatment group than placebo. As evidenced by the combination of suicide attempt and suicidal behavior, there was a mismatch between patients attempting suicide favoring siponimod. A custom search for overdose and completing suicide in a custom search (four siponimod-treated vs. no placebo-treated patients). Depression is more frequently reported in the placebo treatment group and does not provide an explanation for the mismatch in suicidal ideation in the siponimod-treatment group. There are confounding factors in interpreting the increased suicide behavior risk. The number of events reported in all treatment groups is small. Placebo treatment group patients reported suicidal ideation and behaviors at a lower rate that predicted in the MS population, where estimates of suicidal thoughts may be prevalent in 22-29% of patients and suicide rates may be 7.5x greater in patients with MS as compared with the general population. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">18</ref> It is also notable that the patient attempting overdose in Study A2201 had a history of anxiety and depression that predated siponimod, Version date: September 6, 2017 for all NDAs and BLAs the study due to the event (intentional overdose, [suicide attempt]), and received the last dose of study medication on Day 20 . The patient did not enter the extension phase of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Long-term Safety Pool</head><p>In the long-term safety pool, the incidence rate for suicidality terms (as defined by SMQ) was reduced (4.3 per 100 PY) relative to what had been observed in the controlled pool (5.7 per 100 PY), a change driven by the larger number of total events in this pool than by a change in underlying frequency of suicide-related events. Suicidality events in the long-term safety pool are summarized in the following table: Source: 120-day Update SCS Appendix 1, <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 2</ref>.1-13.2 * Safety data collected while on any dose of siponimod in all patients who received at least one dose of 2 mg or 10 mg. **Safety data of all patients receiving at least one dose of 2 mg or 10 mg and collected while on 2 mg or 10 mg treatment (including dose titration period and reduced dose due to tolerability)</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The frequencies of suicide-related TEAEs in the long-term safety pool were largely consistent with the controlled pool.

While labeling for other therapies used in MS has warnings for depression, there does not appear to sufficient evidence in this therapy to warrant a similar warning. </p></div>

Some subgroup populations in the controlled pool were small and represented very few patients' data. Therefore, in most cases, the updated, long-term database findings will be presented and discussed to ensure any summary conclusions are based upon the broadest dose exposure and longest durations of study for all exposed patients.</p><p>The applicant's analyses did not provide comparator groups and so it is not possible to determine if any observed risk differences are due to the demographic factor alone or due to treatment effects that vary by the demographic factor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Duration of Exposure: Gender and Age</head><p>In the long-term safety pool (Safety Database 2), the overall mean durations of exposure to siponimod were 32.32 months for men and 31.66 months for women.</p><p>In the long-term safety pool, the mean duration of exposure to siponimod was comparable between males and females in the age groups of 31 to 45 years, 46 to 55 years and &gt;55 years of age. Mean duration of exposure to siponimod was higher in males than females in the 18 to 30 years age group, but the number of total patients in this age group was small. It is unusual to have patients with SPMS diagnosed before age 35 years, because SPMS is not typically diagnosed until more than a decade after an initial diagnosis of RMS that typically occurs in the second or third decade of life. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">20</ref> Thus, patients with SPMS will be, on average, in their late thirties to mid-forties. It is therefore notable that there were 281/677 (41.5%) men and 444/1060 (41.9%) women &lt; 45 years old in this safety database because that means over 40% of patients with MS in these studies were younger and earlier in the anticipated disability progression based on what is known and published from natural history studies than would be predicted for a typical SPMS population. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">20</ref> Reference ID: 4409498  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Duration of Exposure: Race</head><p>In Safety Database 2, mean exposure for white patients was longest in duration whereas for patients identified as Asian (n=43) and Black/African American (n=11) had siponimod exposure durations that were shorter. In the long-term safety pool, the mean exposure to siponimod was 32.21 months, 26.73 months and 26.92 months for the White, Asian and Black/African American subgroups, respectively.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The small numbers of Asian and Black/African American patients is a reflection of the established demographics of MS, a disease overwhelming diagnosed in white patients with significantly lower worldwide prevalence in Asian and Black patients by comparison. <ref type="bibr">21</ref> The small numbers of minority patients with MS included in any MS development program are unavoidable and should provide caution regarding broad generalization of all study findings to minority patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Duration of Exposure: CYP2C9 genotype</head><p>CYP2C9 is the major metabolizing enzyme of siponimod and exists in the population in isoforms that differ in processing capabilities based on genotype. Out of 1737 patients, 1475 (84.9%) had *1/*1, *1/*2, or *2/*2 genotypes (so-called, "extensive metabolizers"). Mean exposure to the siponimod in Safety Database 2 was 32.14 months and 31.14 months for the extensive metabolizer (*1/*1, *1/*2, *2/*2) and "poor metabolizer" (*1/*3, *2/*3) subgroups, respectively. The applicant recommends siponimod be contraindicated for *3/*3 genotype patients due to their inability to process siponimod; the *3/*3 genotype was not studied in large numbers nor with any depth.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: Most white patients worldwide have the *1/*1, *1/*2, or *2/*2 genotypes, 21 an observation reflected in the clinical trial genotype data. The comparable durations of exposures between these groups are sufficiently close to provide meaningful conclusions, however. This reviewer agrees with the contraindication for *3/*3 genotype patients because of the manifold risks of their profound lack of metabolization of siponimod.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse Events: Gender</head><p>Considering all patients exposed to siponimod, the proportion of patients with at least one AE was 91.1% and 92.0% for male and female patients, respectively. In the siponimod 2 mg group during controlled trial phases, the exposure adjusted incidence rate (expressed per 100 patientyears) for patients with any AE was higher for women (277.0) than for men (229.3) whereas in placebo treatment groups, the incidence rate was not as disparate between men (184.3) and women (181.3).</p><p>In the long-term safety database, the percentage of patients with an AE was similar in both genders for most SOCs. The largest differences in percentage of AEs between male and female patients existed in the following SOCs: Nervous System Disorders (36.2%, 46.4%, respectively) with headache (12.1%, 18.9%) and dizziness (6.1%, 9.7%) being the most common listed preferred terms; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (26.3%, 33.7%) with back pain (6.8%, 10.0%) the most common preferred term; Gastrointestinal Disorders (23.5%, 31.2%) with nausea showing the most striking discrepancy (4.1%, 9.5%) between genders.</p><p>While most AEs were comparable between genders, differences of ≥ 5% in the percentage of male and female patients with AEs were observed for the following PTs in Safety Database 2: bradycardia (7.7%, 2.7%), nausea (4.1%, 9.5%), urinary tract infection (11.7%, 19.4%) GGT increased (8.6%, 3.5%) and headache <ref type="bibr">(12.1%, 18.9%)</ref>. Alanine aminotransferase increased was reported in 8.9% of male and 4.2% of female patients.

The difference in urinary tract infections between men and women is not consistent with the literature 8 than shows equal rates of urinary tract infection between male and female patients with MS, but there did appear to be a disparity in the rates of catheterization in enrolled men versus women that could explain the difference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse Events: Age</head><p>In the updated Safety Database 2, the proportion of patients with at least one AE was 90.6% and 92.4% for patients in the ≤ 45 years and &gt; 45 years subgroups. For most SOCs, the percentage of patients with an AE was similar in both age groups. There were differences in the percentages of patients with AEs for the ≤45 years and &gt;45 years age groups in the SOCs of Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders (15.9%, 8.9%, respectively) with lymphopenia the most common PT (10.6%, 6.1%), Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications (21.2%, 28.5%) primarily due to falls (8.4%, 16.3%), Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (25.7%, 34.5%) with back pain the most common preferred term (7.0%, 10.0%) and Vascular Disorders (10.5%, 20.3%,) primarily due to hypertension (7.3%, 14.1%).</p><p>Differences of ≥ 5% in the percentage of patients ≤ 45 years and &gt;45 years of age with AEs were  Because CYP2C9 is the primary metabolizing enzyme of siponimod, there is a concern that patients with poor metabolization of siponimod may experience larger frequencies of AEs because of higher than expected exposure. The proportions of patients with at least one AE reported in Safety Database 2 were comparable between the extensive metabolizer (*1/*1, *2/*1, *2/*2) patient population (91.5%) and the poor metabolizer (*1/*3, *2/*3) population (92.6%), and there were no overall differences between the frequencies of the most frequent AEs in these subgroups in the controlled pool.</p><p>Though overall findings in SOCs and preferred terms were largely similar, there were some notable exceptions. Infections and Infestations TEAEs were 7.5% less frequent in the poor metabolizer population. There were differences in the incidences of macular edema: 1.0%, IR=0.4/100 PY and 3.1%, IR=1.2/100 PY between the extensive and poor metabolizer subgroups, respectively. There was a trend toward increased frequency of hypertension reported in poor metabolizer subgroups; otherwise, percentage differences between subgroups were less than 5%. associated with siponimod, dyspnea and macular edema, reported in poor metabolizers versus extensive metabolizers. The applicant proposes dose adjustments for poor metabolizers based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data to ensure exposure that will be equally as effective and as safe as the 2 mg dose will be in extensive metabolizers. This reviewer agrees that poor metabolizers should have a maintenance dose lower than extensive metabolizers to ensure safe dosing. Genotype information will need to be included in safety reports and monitored for any systematic patterns of AEs in the postmarketing setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Serious Adverse Events: Gender</head><p>In Safety Database 2, the proportion of patients with at least one SAE was 24.8% for male patients and 22.4% for female patients. In the SOC of Infections and infestations, the frequencies of SAEs was 6.4% for men and 3.9% for women. Urinary tract infection was the most disparate preferred term under the Infections and Infestations SOC, reported for 2.5% and 1.4%, male and female patients respectively.) In the other SOCs, the incidence of SAEs was comparable for male and female patients.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: There were small (&lt;5%) differences between men and woman on some SAEs but no clear pattern nor clinically significant differences are apparent. The AEs that were most discrepant between men and women were less so in the SAE database. The difference in the Infections and Infestations SOC appears to be a statistical consequence of the relatively smaller population of men yielding more events with fewer observations and not a true clinical difference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Serious Adverse Events: Age</head><p>In the controlled pool of patients treated with siponimod 2 mg, there was a higher incidence rate of SAEs in the &gt;45-year-old age group (141 patients; 14.4/100 PY) than in the ≤45-year-old age group (52 patients; 8.6/100 PY). The difference was due to a higher incidence of Infections and Infestations (24 patients, 2.2/100 PY versus 9 patients, 1.4/100 PY) and Nervous System Disorders (28 patients, 2.6/100 PY versus 11 patients, 1.7/100 PY) in the older age group.</p><p>In Safety Database 2, the proportion of patients with at least one SAE was 19.0% and 26.4% for patients in the ≤ 45 years and &gt; 45 years subgroups, respectively. For most SOCs, the incidence of SAEs was comparable for the age-related subgroups. The SOCs with the highest differences in frequency of SAEs reported for patients in the ≤ 45 years and &gt; 45 years subgroups are included in the following table:  Reviewer Comment: The large difference in fall-related SAEs between the two age groups mirrors the nearly two-fold difference in non-serious fall AEs observed between the older and younger subgroups. The difference in quality of the Nervous System SOC events appears to recapitulate the different SAE risks that are associated with aging. The prevalence of TIA and strokes increases approximately three-fold with each decade lived, and patients with MS are at overall higher risk for stroke at any age. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">22</ref> The appearance of neurovascular events in patients with MS older than age 45 years old is therefore not unexpected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Serious Adverse Events: Race</head><p>In Safety Database 2, the proportions of patients with at least one SAE were 23.6%, 20.9% and 27.3% for White, Asian and Black subgroups, respectively. Three patients experienced at least 1 SAE in the Black subgroup. 9 patients experienced at least 1 SAE in the Asian subgroup. The SAEs in the Black subgroup included unique events of asthenia, gait disturbance urinary tract infection, craniocerebral injury, and seizure. In the Asian subgroup, the SAEs included bradycardia, influenza, femoral neck fracture, increased bilirubin, pulmonary function test decreased, multiple sclerosis relapse (n=2), secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, and dizziness.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The paucity of patients and events in the Black and Asian subgroups precludes any substantial interpretation of the racial subgroup findings other than confirming the presence in these subgroups of the same high frequency SAEs observed in the overall study population such as urinary tract infection, femoral neck fracture, and multiple sclerosis relapse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Serious Adverse Events: Genotype</head><p>In Safety Database 2, the proportions of patients with at least one SAE were 23.2% in both the extensive (*1/*1, *2/*1, *2/*2) and poor (*3/*1, *2/*3) metabolizer subgroups. The poor metabolizer subgroup experienced only 60 SAEs (as compared to 343 in the larger, extensive metabolizer group). The following table provides a summary of potential SAEs identified as most common or of concern for siponimod from updated long-term safety database.     As was the case in the Controlled Pool, the largest number of reported malignancies in the Long-term Safety Pools were skin malignancies. As a S1P modulator, siponimod presumably has a mechanism of action sufficiently like that of fingolimod that the risk of cutaneous malignancies observed in postmarketing will be similar. This would mean that siponimod would be associated with skin malignancies (mainly squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma), the available data for siponimod do not suggest an increase of such malignancies. However, the applicant notes that the number of events of any type of malignancy to date, and the duration of follow-up, is relatively limited and does not permit conclusions currently on any potential long-term risk. The most parsimonious assumption would be to assume the same risk for siponimod as fingolimod, and therefore provide labeling in line with this assumed increased risk of cutaneous malignancies.</p><p>A second case of breast cancer was identified in the Long-term Pool.</p></div>

Most confirmed relapses were treated with high-dose steroids. As per Table 17 (Concomitant Medications), just over 25% of subjects received significant doses of steroids (methylprednisolone, prednisolone, dexamethasone); however, the number of confirmed relapses treated with steroids (Table 18) is much less. Although high-dose steroids can be given for many indications other than a confirmed MS relapse, the frequency of steroid administration in CBAF312A2304, like in many other MS studies, suggests that a substantial number of subjects may have been given steroids for unconfirmed relapses, worsening MS symptoms, or other reasons. Subjects who experienced 6-month CDP during the study were allowed to remain in the study but change from the assigned study treatment to open label siponimod or another MS therapy. 241 subjects changed to open label siponimod or another MS drug, mostly to open label siponimod. See Table 19. Despite this treatment change, these subjects remained in the Treatment Epoch.</note></figure>

The patient received the first dose of study medication on Day 1 . On Day 400 , the patient was hospitalized with a transient ischemic attack which lasted for 20 minutes. The patient experienced transient aphasia and decrease in binocular acuity which lasted for less than one hour. The patient's CT scan was unremarkable. Treatment included acetylsalicylate. The event (transient ischemic attack) was considered resolved on the same day . Treatment with the study medication was temporarily interrupted due to the event on Day 401 and the patient was discharged from the hospital. Treatment with study medication was restarted on the following day . September 6, 2017 for all NDAs and BLAs doppler ultrasound of neck vessels did not show any remarkable findings or plaques. Blood flow was symmetrical. The patient received the last dose of the study medication history of other treatments for MS. The patient has depression, tinea versicolor, and metrorrhagia.

Increased total cholesterol is a risk factor for cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease and associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. While the total cholesterol increases were small and associated with large variability, they were sustained throughout treatment. There was a &gt;5% frequency of elevated cholesterol-related events during long-term siponimod therapy. However, analysis of the adverse events related to the sub-components of the total cholesterol linked with increased risk of vascular disease, increased low density lipoprotein and decreased high density lipoprotein, revealed no real differences between siponimod and placebo, and the reported frequencies of these events in the long-term safety pool fail to justify a definitive conclusion of siponimod treatment being associated with a change in cholesterol parameters associated with disease risk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vital Signs</head><p>Based on prior experience with S1P modulators, there was an expectation that the predominant changes in vital signs associated with siponimod administration would be diminished heart rate and small but sustained increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings. Bradycardia and hypertension were confirmed in the safety pool. No other unanticipated vital sign changes were elucidated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Heart Rate</head><p>Siponimod's action on S1P receptors in cardiac tissues has a known effect of acutely reducing heart rate during treatment initiation and can be associated with the induction of cardiac  <ref type="bibr">Section 8.3.3</ref>.) The applicant investigated heart rate changes during the first seven days of siponimod administration. Overall, some heart rate reduction occurred after each dose on each day of treatment, but the greatest reduction and most bradycardic events (see Section 8.5.2.) occurred on Day 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Controlled Pool</head><p>In Study A2304, the initial 0.25 mg dose of siponimod yielded significant reductions in heart rates with a maximum mean reduction achieved at 4 hours post-first dose of -5.30 beats per minute relative to the baseline resting heart rate. At Day 6 of the titration, when patients had reached the maintenance dose of 2 mg, the heart rate reductions after the seventh dose more modest, with a maximum mean reduction in heart rate achieved at 3 hours post-dose of -3.08 BPM. Long-term Safety Pool There were patients in the long-term safety pool who experienced new PR intervals ≥300 msec or a new change from baseline in QTcF &gt;60 msec. Of the patients in the long-term safety pool, 3 (0.2%) patients in the siponimod 2-10 mg broad group had new PR intervals ≥300 msec. A total of 9 (0.5%) patients in the siponimod 2-10 mg broad group had a &gt;60 msec change from baseline in QTcF. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>120-day Safety Update</head><p>There were three new additional reports added to the long-term safety database. For QTcF, there were 2 new reports of change from baseline &gt;30 msec and a value of 403 msec was reported for a male patient. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Long-term Safety Pool</head><p>As expected, infections remained common in the long-term safety pool, with 55.4% (962/1737) of patients reporting a preferred term within a broad search of infection-related terms.</p><p>Fungal skin infection frequency in the long-term safety pool decreased from the controlled pool to 1.2%.</p><p>There were additional reports of herpetic virus reactivation, including varicella zoster virus, but the overall incidence rates for herpetic reactivation events other than varicella remained the same at 1.4 per 100 PY while the varicella reactivation IR increased from 1.6 to 1.8 per 100PY.</p><p>There were no new cases of other opportunistic infections noted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>120-day Safety Update</head><p>Infection frequencies in the updated safety pool data remained stable with 58.2% (1011/1637) of patients in the safety database experiencing an infection-related event.</p><p>Skin fungal infection frequency remained 1.2%.</p><p>There were nine more patients with events consistent with varicella virus reactivation added to the safety database, but the incidence rate for these events remained 1.8 per 100 PY. For all herpetic infections other than varicella, the incidence rate was 1.3 per 100 PY.</p><p>The 120-day update did not provide any opportunistic infection cases. A case of cryptococcal meningitis was reported in a patient taking siponimod in a MedWatch report form filed after the 120-day update.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The infection risk associated with siponimod appears like that of the approved S1P modulator, fingolimod. The similarity of the overall infection frequencies between siponimod and placebo suggest that immune function remains despite relative lymphopenia and most patients are at low risk of opportunistic infections when administered the 2 mg siponimod dose. However, given the evidence of varicella virus reactivation and the addition of a late breaking report of cryptococcal meningitis, it does appear that siponimod is associated with enough immune suppression to be associated with herpes virus recrudescence and, rarely, opportunistic infections. Labeling can provide appropriate guidance regarding the overall infection risks and Warnings and bradycardia were reported in 48 (4.4%) and 14 (1.3%) patients treated with siponimod 2 mg in the first 7 days of treatment and for no patients from days 8 to 28. By comparison, in Study A2201, prior to instituting titration, the frequency of bradycardia was as high as 28% and sinus bradycardia frequency was over 4%.</p><p>Along with vital sign monitoring, there were ECG evaluations performed in patients during dose initiation and titration. Changes in QTcF parameters were the most common new findings based on the ECG studies. Specifically, the most common (~10%) observed change from baseline was a change of greater than 30 msec and a new QTcF interval or greater than 430 msec (male) or new greater than 450 msec (female) in patients treated with siponimod. The incidence of clinically relevant QTcF changes was low and only 3 patients experienced QTcF increases from baseline of more than 60 msec. Sinus bradycardia, first degree AV block (PR prolongation), and flat T waves (which were of no clinical significance) were noted less frequently. PR interval prolongation was more common (82/986 or 8.3%) in the siponimod treatment group as compared to the placebo group (14/485 or 2.9%); none of the PR prolongations were associated with symptoms. Most of these observed changes, including bradycardia and 1st degree atrioventricular block, were asymptomatic and did not require additional treatment. In Study A2201, before titration, there were five patients with 2 nd degree atrioventricular block with symptomatic bradycardia, four of these were reported as SAEs.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The titration regimen appears to reduce the magnitude of the bradycardia associated with siponimod in all patients. The reduction in bradycardic events in titrated versus un-titrated patients suggests the 6-day titration achieved the goal of reducing cardiac disorder events related to bradycardia. The frequencies of atrioventricular block were also reduced by titration and the elimination of more severe symptomatic blocks is encouraging.</p><p>The Expanded Cardiac Monitoring group had more findings before (as expected) and after initial treatment with siponimod. The Expanded Cardiac Monitoring group had a higher incidence of any findings at Day 1 pre-dose (~25%) compared to Standard Cardiac Monitoring group with extensive cardiac assessments (~8% heart rate was at least 50 bpm or maximally 10 bpm lower than the baseline value; heart rate was not the lowest value measured during the observation period; there were no symptoms related to decreased heart rate; ECG at 6 hours did not show any new significant treatment-emergent ECG abnormalities; other than sinus bradycardia, not observed at the pre-dose ECG." At Day 7, no patients met criteria 3 or 4 to justify further monitoring. There were no patients who had ECG changes that justified additional monitoring, and there were no patients with symptomatic events that required monitoring beyond Day 7. On review, this "need for monitoring" was enforced on Day 7 because patients were experiencing bradycardia, which was expected with this therapy, and, as noted previously, patients in the higher risk monitoring group had greater reduction in their heart rates than the standard risk group. Therefore, these restrictive criteria regarding heart rate on Day 7 do not appear to be useful for inclusion on labeling, and there does not appear to be justification for ECG monitoring on Day 7 for either the standard or higher cardiac risk patients.</p></div>

Still, despite a slow rise in frequency, the lack a biologically plausible mechanism, the absence of a clear temporal relationship to treatment initiation, and the fact that the observed frequency of seizures remains less than half the predicted rates based on what is reported in the general MS population creates uncertainty about the strength and magnitude of the association between siponimod and seizures. It is noteworthy that in the Agency's review of clinical safety for the approved S1P modulator fingolimod that there was a similar frequency of seizures in fingolimod-treated patients that was higher than placebo-treated patients but lacking a clear temporal association with treatment start that invited speculation by the reviewer and the applicant about a potential relationship. I would advocate that labeling for siponimod adopt the same approach as with fingolimod, reporting of the data without an explicit endorsement of a potential association.</p></div>

The patient did not have a history of diabetes mellitus or evidence of retinopathy prior to study start. At the time of screening the patient was not an active smoker.

On Day 2 until Day 20, the patient complained of mild dyspnea at night, occurring at rest. The patient reported that he was anxious on these days; the investigator commented that psychosomatic dyspnea seemed a possible diagnosis. No action was taken with the study medication due to this event. On Day 20, the patient took 41 tablets of study medication (intentional overdose) in an attempted suicide and then at about four hours after ingestion drove himself to the hospital. The patient received charcoal and was monitored. He did not experience bradycardia or dyspnea. He was transferred to a psychiatric ward. The study medication was permanently discontinued due to the event (intentional overdose) on the same day <ref type="bibr">(Day 20)</ref>. Laboratory exams on Day 20 revealed an increase of transaminases (ALT at 90 U/l, AST at 52 U/l) and a normal white blood count (7.26x10 9 /L). On Day 25, during hospitalization, the patient was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. No treatment was given for these events.

On Day 38, the patient's pulmonary function tests (PFTs), i.e. the FEV1 and the FVC were noted to be less than 80% of the baseline predicted value. FEV1 was 71% and FVC was 59% of the baseline predicted values. The PFTs improved to greater than 80% of the predicted baseline values in the subsequent visits.

The patient prematurely discontinued Reviewer Comment: Many of the increased frequencies of TEAEs with advanced age are known epiphenomena independent of siponimod exposure. For example, the diagnosis of hypertension increases with advancing age. However, there is a significant mismatch in the frequency of falls between patients younger than 45 <ref type="bibr">(8.4%)</ref> and patients older than 45 <ref type="bibr">(16.3%)</ref>. Dizziness <ref type="bibr">(8.7% and 8.0%</ref>) and vertigo <ref type="bibr">(4.4% and 4.2%</ref>) TEAE frequencies remained stable across the age cut-off, and so it does not appear older patients experience more vertiginous phenomena that would raise fall risk. The increase in falls observed for patients &gt; 45 years old is consistent with published data showing increasing fall risk in older, more disabled patients with SPMS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">10</ref> In Section 8.6.9, there is a greater risk of certain types of injuries in falls in older patients, a finding consistent with the published literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">10</ref> with the caveat that there is not a linear relationship between injury risk associated with falls and EDSS score worsening, <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">12</ref> a finding that explains the paradoxical lower EDSS score average in patients with SAEs of serious injuries.</p></div>

Other alleles commonly found in the population, *2 and *3 (among others) have reduced enzyme activity. Patients with *1/*2 will have an approximate 40% reduction in CYP2C9 enzyme activity over *1/*1. The *3 allele produces a CYP2C9 isoform with very little enzymatic activity. Patients with *1/*3 will have 75% less enzymatic activity than patients with the *1/*1 genotype, and *3/*3 will have 90% or greater reduction in CYP2C9 activity (see the Clinical Pharmacology Review for further discussion of CYP2C9 enzyme isoforms as they relate to siponimod.) poor metabolizer patients due to higher exposure. Some sample sizes were too small to interpret, and caution is advised with most comparisons because of the small size of the patient pool.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specific Safety Studies/Clinical Trials</head><p>All clinical trial data are discussed in the preceding sections. There were no safety trials conducted aside from the Clinical Pharmacology Studies summarized in Section 8.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Safety Explorations</head><p>Human Carcinogenicity or Tumor Development S1P modulators like siponimod appear to be associated with increased risk of certain malignancies, specifically, cutaneous malignancies.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Controlled Pool</head><p>In the controlled pool of the trials in MS, there was an observed lower overall malignancy risk among siponimod treatment condition patients compared to placebo treatment group patients.

However, most of these cancerous lesions were identified at early visits whereas the increased risk associated with fingolimod emerged in postmarketing studies. Thus, it was not surprising that overall in the controlled trial phase, there was no difference in frequency of cutaneous malignancies overall between the incidence of cutaneous malignancies in the siponimod (1.2%) and placebo treatment groups (1.3%). Likewise, the rate of any skin cancer was approximately equal in siponimod-exposed patients 0.91/100PY (16/1758.81PY) compared to 0.96/100PY (8/835.28PY) in placebo-treated patients.</p><p>Among the cutaneous malignancies identified in the controlled clinical trials, basal cell carcinoma was the most common skin malignancy and was reported with a similar incidence in the siponimod-exposed (1.1%, 14 patients) and placebo (1.2%, 7 patients) groups.

Malignant melanoma related events (including a case of gastrointestinal melanoma) were reported in three patients (0.3%) in the siponimod treatment group; there were no reported cases in the placebo group. Skin squamous cell carcinoma was reported in two siponimod-exposed patients (0.2%) compared to no reported cases in placebo-treated patients.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The labeling for the approved S1P modulator, fingolimod, includes a specific Warnings and Precautions statement citing an increased risk of basal cell carcinoma and melanoma. A Warnings and Precautions entry for cutaneous malignancies is not justified for siponimod based on the nearly equal frequencies and rates between siponimod and placebo treatments. However, given the high degree of similarity between siponimod and fingolimod, there is an expectation of a rise in skin cancers and perhaps other malignancies in the postmarketing setting. I recommend enhanced reported of malignancies to ascertain whether siponimod confers the same increased risk of skin cancers as fingolimod. Aside from cutaneous malignancies, the only cancer noted in more than one patient was seminoma, in two male patients in the siponimod treatment group, for an overall incidence rate of approximately 0.003/100 man-years (2/~692 man-years). Seminoma accounts for approximately 2% of all malignant cancers in men and is the most common cancer worldwide in men ages 15-40 years old. <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">23</ref> The overall testicular incidence rates among non-Hispanic white men in European countries and the United States is around 5-6 per 100,000 men. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">24</ref> Therefore, having two diagnosed cases in a pool of 239 men would represent an unexpectedly high number of patients with seminomas in a non-Hispanic, white male population.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: Seminomas are a common cancer in men, but the observed rate in siponimod-treated men is out of proportion to what would be predicted (even using the highest estimates for populations) and is therefore of concern. It is reassuring that no more cases of seminoma nor other germ cell line tumors emerged in the long-term safety database. Nonclinical findings did not raise concern of an increased rate of testicular cancer. Nevertheless, this reviewer would advise increased pharmacovigilance for any reports of seminomas in the postmarketing setting.</p><p>There were two cases of breast cancer reported in Study A2304 during the controlled phase, yielding an incidence rate of IR of 0.1 per 100 PY.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abuse Potential</head><p>The applicant states that "chemistry, nonclinical and clinical data with siponimod do not indicate any signals of abuse, misuse, or dependence potential in animals or humans, nor do the data demonstrate any potential pharmacological similarities to existing drugs of abuse or psychoactive effects that may be of interest for drug abuse, such as reinforcing, moodelevating, sedative, stimulant, hallucinogenic or acute cognitive effects."

The amount of data from longer periods of follow up is limited (18.2% of patients with at least 3 months of follow-up). Information was also collected for patients who discontinued study drug and had a posttreatment follow up visit 3 months after last dose of study drug in Studies A2201 and A2201E1. Analysis of patients who discontinued therapy did not demonstrate findings consistent with a withdrawal syndrome.</p><p>Overall, the applicant states that the available data show no evidence of a rebound effect after discontinuing siponimod treatment, defined as higher levels of clinical (relapses, deterioration in EDSS scores) or MRI inflammatory disease activity compared to baseline or to placebo. On review of the follow-up data, newly occurring or worsening AEs that were observed after the discontinuation of siponimod treatment were generally infrequent and did not show any consistent pattern compared to placebo that would be indicative of withdrawal effects. All AEs occurring 1-30 days after study drug discontinuation were also reported as on-treatment AEs. Patients who discontinued and experienced AEs, disability worsening, and new MRI findings did not experience events that met the defined criteria used to identify "severe exacerbations" associated with fingolimod discontinuation.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: Regarding rebound, the S1P modulator fingolimod has a labeling warning for severe exacerbations in disability and inflammation following discontinuation. These severe exacerbation events were rare and not noted in the development program for fingolimod likely because the number of patients treated was insufficient to observe a rare outcome and because the durations of observation after discontinuation were too short as the effect can occur 3 months or longer after the cessation of S1P modulator treatment. No such events with a marked increase in EDSS score or large number of new enhancing lesions was noted after discontinuation in either Studies A2201 or A2304. Given that siponimod exerts the same basic sequestration effect on lymphocytes as fingolimod, it is still possible the same withdrawal phenomenon will become apparent with siponimod. Siponimod's relatively shorter half-life should reduce the window of time when severe rebounds may occur after discontinuation, however. Based on the fingolimod data and risk of severe exacerbations being mechanistically intrinsic to all S1P modulator therapies, the applicant has agreed to a labeling risk of severe exacerbation after discontinuation of siponimod as a Warning and Precaution. </p></div>

However, siponimod treatment was associated with higher rates of herpes infections and herpetic recrudescence (i.e., varicella zoster). Most of the infections reported during siponimod therapy were grades 1 or 2 in severity. In controlled phases of MS trials, in patients administered siponimod, there were infections reported as serious adverse events, but the number of total events was small. Pneumonia and upper respiratory tract SAEs were more common in siponimod-treated patients. Urinary tract infections occurred at high frequencies in both the siponimod and placebo treatment groups in Study A2304, but urinary tract infections were not a frequent in Study A2201, which argues against a generalized higher risk of urinary tract infections in all patients with MS and instead reflects the increased frequency of the urinary dysfunction that occurs in patients with SPMS. There were more cases of varicella reactivation in siponimod-treated patients, and one SAE of varicella meningitis in a siponimod-treated patient. There were no opportunistic infections reported in controlled phases of MS trials, but there is a recently reported initial case of cryptococcal meningitis in a patient treated with 2 mg siponimod in the extension trial. There were two deaths due to sepsis and one death due to severe pneumonia. The contribution of siponimod to these deaths could be a result of immune suppression caused by sequestration of lymphocytes, though the exact role of siponimod in these deaths is unclear due to mitigating circumstances as discussed in Section 8.4.1.</p><p>Infection risk and the risk of opportunistic infections such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and cryptococcal meningitis should be described in a Warnings and Precautions statement on labeling of siponimod, and the applicant has proposed language appropriate for such a statement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Lymphopenia</head><p>Administration of siponimod yields a reduction in serum lymphocytes, predominantly CD4+ and CD8+ subtypes, with relative sparing of neutrophils. Lymphopenia and related treatment emergent AEs occurred more frequently in siponimod treatment groups than in placebo treatment groups. Lymphopenia requiring discontinuation of treatment occurred in approximately 0.2% of patients and only occurred in siponimod treatment groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Macular Edema</head><p>Macular edema was a priori expected to be a treatment-related adverse event due to siponimod's effects on vascular permeability and prior experience with S1P modulators. Macular edema was reported in approximately 2% of patients exposed to siponimod. The frequency of macular edema associated with siponimod exposure is identical to the frequency observed with the approved S1P modulator, fingolimod.</p><p>The applicant has proposed a Warnings and Precautions statement for macular edema, and this reviewer agrees with including macular edema among Warnings and Precautions. This reviewer further agrees with the applicant's proposed labeling identifying an increased frequency of macular edema observed in patients with histories of uveitis and diabetes mellitus as is the case with labeling for the approved S1P modulator, fingolimod.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Bradycardia/Arrhythmia</head><p>Initiation of siponimod requires a 6-day titration to maintenance dose. The dose titration used to initiate siponimod is associated with a reduced rate of cardiac TEAEs as compared to dose initiation without titration. For patients without known cardiac histories, the titration was well-tolerated and adverse events requiring treatment discontinuation were In order to determine whether a patient has an occult arrhythmia or to confirm an ongoing issue, all patients should have an ECG prior to initiation of siponimod.</p><p>Patients with risk of cardiac adverse events, specifically patients with a current or history of bradycardia or arrhythmias, had new ECG persistent findings and more serious adverse events. These higher risk patients require a pre-and post-dose ECG evaluation on Day 1 of treatment in a monitored setting for safe initiation of siponimod.</p><p>Labeling should define the high-risk cardiac group and provide appropriate recommended monitoring after initial dose of not less than 6 hours of observation for high risk patients, and instructions regarding further care if serious adverse events are noted in any patient. Patients in the high-risk cardiac group should have first dose monitoring to include a preand a post-dose ECG with 6 hours of in-house physician monitoring. Siponimod should be contraindicated for patients with significant cardiac disease such as heart failure, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, angina pectoris or myocardial infarction (within 6 months), unstable angina. Siponimod should be contraindicated for patients with significant cardiac conduction disorders such as left bundle branch block, sinus arrest or sino-atrial block, symptomatic bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome, Mobitz Type II second degree AV-block or higher-grade AV-block, unless patient has a functioning pacemaker.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Malignancy</head><p>Siponimod may be associated with increased risk of malignancies. Due to protocolmandated dermatology evaluations, there was a high frequency of cutaneous malignancies reported in the controlled and long-term safety patient pools. There was not a clear increased risk of all skin malignancies associated with siponimod therapy, but there were cases of malignant melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma reported in the siponimod treatment group in controlled trials without any cases identified in the placebo treatment group despite the same monitoring. The increased attention for skin malignancies was driven by the increased frequency of skin malignancies noted in the postmarketing longitudinal experience with the approved S1P modulator, fingolimod. Siponimod and fingolimod have similar treatment effects on circulating lymphocyte numbers and in many key respects have nearly identical treatment outcomes. Therefore, it is reasonable that the increased risk of skin malignancies associated with fingolimod therapy will be observed with siponimod. Labeling should provide data regarding melanoma risk appearing increased with siponimod and otherwise reference fingolimod's Warning and Precautions regarding cutaneous malignancies as a risk of S1P modulator therapy. The applicant should collect postmarketing reports of serious skin malignancies and provide them to the Division in a timely fashion as part of enhanced pharmacovigilance for skin malignancies. Other malignancies appeared at similar frequencies between siponimod and placebo treatment groups, apart from seminomas. There is no specific mechanism to explain why S1P modulation would be a risk factor for seminoma. The most plausible mechanism of this increased risk would be a loss of circulating lymphocytes and reduced immune surveillance, but this broadly applicable mechanism would result in an increased frequency in all malignancies. This mechanism does not explain why an increased risk of seminoma was not seen with a less selective S1P modulator, fingolimod, unless siponimod's selectivity reduces a very specific lymphocyte pool used for this surveillance that was not appreciated in the data from the completed clinical trials.</p><p>This reviewer recommends increased pharmacovigilance for all malignancies with timely reporting of malignancies and annual summaries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Seizures</head><p>The SAE rate of 1.7% (odds ratio=3.4) for seizures and related events is not unexpected given the expected observation of seizure events one would anticipate in the patient population with MS who are at significantly higher risk of developing seizures than the general population. However, the relative absence of SAEs related to seizure in the placebo treatment group, who presumably are also at the same high risk of seizures due to MS, suggests that siponimod therapy may be associated with higher risk than the expected population risk of seizures, even if the observed frequency of 1.7% is well below the rate one expected to see based on natural history studies of epilepsy in patients with MS. I therefore agree with the applicant's proposed labeling that will report the controlled population data and the observed frequency of seizures in siponimod 2 mg and placebotreated patients in Section 6 to provide prescribers and patients with notice of the possible association.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Respiratory Effects</head><p>As with other S1P modulators, siponimod was associated with a reduction in FEV1, FVC, and DLCO. While treatment emergent respiratory disorders adverse events such as dyspnea, cough, and airway restriction occurred in less than 5% of patients taking siponimod, respiratory events such as cough and dyspnea were more frequently reported in siponimodtreated patients, and there was a serious adverse event and a treatment discontinuation due to dyspnea in the siponimod treatment group and none in the placebo treated group.</p><p>Labeling should indicate in a Warnings and Precautions statement about the respiratory effects of siponimod.</p><p>Due to the uncertainty about the persistence and long-term consequences of reduced lung functional measures in a patient population with a progressive neurological disease that can compromise respiratory function, we are requiring the applicant to conduct a postmarketing study of lung function measures (FEV1, FVC, and DLCO) and respiratoryrelated adverse events in patients who initiate siponimod 8. Embolic and Thrombotic Events A disproportionate number of strokes and myocardial infarctions were reported in siponimod-treated patients in controlled trials. Analysis of these cases confirmed the presence of concurrent risk factors, but confounding factors alone did not fully explain the larger number of cases in the siponimod treatment group. The difference between the placebo and siponimod treatment groups was small. Further data supplied by the long-term safety pool did not show an augmentation of the potential safety signal.</p><p>Language in Section 6 describing the frequency of thromboembolic events in clinical trials appears adequate and is how similar risk was described for fingolimod.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Liver Injury</head><p>Siponimod causes persistent elevations in AST, ALT, and GGT. These elevations are not associated with fulminant hepatic failure. The increased transaminase levels in serum reached by most patients were not associated with any symptoms. Discontinuation of siponimod leads to reversal of observed changes. A baseline evaluation of hepatic enzymes and monitoring during treatment can mitigate potential risks of liver injury.</p><p>Labeling should provide appropriate instructions regarding monitoring and symptoms concerning for liver injury in a Warnings and Precautions statement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.">Elevated total cholesterol</head><p>Siponimod therapy was associated with a small increase in serum total cholesterol that was sustained throughout the entire duration of treatment. Hypercholesterolemia adverse events were reported more frequently in siponimod treatment groups than in placebo treatment groups in controlled trials.</p><p>The absolute increase in total cholesterol was less than 1 mmol/L and had high variability.</p><p>The difference in adverse events between the siponimod and placebo treatment groups was small, was certainly multifactorial, and of unclear clinical significance because they were not associated with an increase in adverse events such as increased low-density lipoprotein or diminished high density lipoprotein. The evidence does not appear to support a significant risk that merits attention in labeling. The increased risk of vascular events in siponimod trials was not due to cholesterol effects because the association between high </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">Genotype</head><p>There are differences in enzymatic activity for the CYP2C9 enzyme that processes siponimod, and there were some differences in frequencies of reported adverse events with clear association to siponimod therapy such as macular edema between patients with the high and low CYP2C9 enzymatic activities. The applicant has proposed to continue a genotype-based dosing of siponimod that was based on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic testing to ensure that patients have the same approximate serum exposure regardless of their genotype and relative enzyme function. Labeling should recommend that patients with the highest metabolism (*1/*1, *1/*2, and *2/*2) should use a maintenance dose of 2 mg and that patients with reduced metabolism (*1/*3 and *2/*3) should use a maintenance dose of 1 mg. Labeling should indicate that patients with the *3/*3 genotype will be contraindicated from treatment with siponimod.</p><p>Additionally, because genotyping of CYP2C9 is required before initiation of siponimod to determine dosing/eligibility, the applicant will be required to validate a commercial genotype assay for this purpose. The existing commercial assays for assessment of CYP2C9 for warfarin dose adjustment can be used "off label" until an assay is validated for siponimod specifically.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12.">Falls and Dizziness</head><p>In controlled MS trials, there were more SAEs of falls accompanied by traumatic injuries such as lacerations, concussions, and fractures in the siponimod treatment groups than in placebo treatment groups. The overall frequencies of falls, however, were less than 1% different between treatment groups, 11.1% versus 10.2% for siponimod and placebo, respectively. Falls and trauma are common in MS, and there was an absence of a clear difference in the frequency and nature of the falls described in the siponimod group to suggest a treatment effect. While the mismatch in falls was not compelling, dizziness was more frequent in siponimod, 7.0% versus 5.3%. Dizziness should be included in Section 6 of labeling as a difference noted between siponimod and placebo.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12.">Postmarketing Requirements and Commitments</head><p>At the time of completion of this review, it appears there will be five postmarketing studies requested of the applicant, two related to pregnancy, one related to pulmonary function test changes, a pediatric study, and juvenile toxicology studies to support a pediatric study requirement. There is a postmarketing commitment to develop a genotype assay for CYP2C9.</p><p>The first study, a postmarketing requirement, will be a prospective pregnancy exposure registry cohort analyses in the United States that will compare the maternal, fetal, and infant outcomes of women with multiple sclerosis exposed to siponimod during pregnancy with two unexposed control populations: one consisting of women with multiple sclerosis who have not been exposed to siponimod before or during pregnancy and the other consisting of women without multiple sclerosis. The registry will identify and record pregnancy complications, major and minor congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, elective terminations, preterm births, small for gestational-age births, and any other adverse outcomes, including postnatal growth and development. The applicant should assess outcomes throughout pregnancy. Infant outcomes, including effects on postnatal growth and development, should be assessed through at least the first year of life.</p><p>The second requested study, a postmarketing requirement, will be a pregnancy outcomes study using a different study design than provided for the prospective pregnancy exposure study (for example, a retrospective cohort study using claims or electronic medical record data or a case control study) to assess major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and small-for-gestational-age births in women exposed to siponimod during pregnancy compared The third study, a postmarketing requirement, requested of the applicant will be a prospective study of the respiratory effects, specifically, the changes in FEV1, FVC, and DLCO associated with siponimod, Patients will be followed after discontinuation</p><p>The fourth study, a postmarketing requirement, will be a juvenile rat toxicology study to evaluate effects of siponimod on growth, reproductive development, and neurological and neurobehavioral development. This study is necessary to support the proposed pediatric study commitment.</p><p>The fifth study, a postmarketing requirement, is a study to be conducted in patients with relapsing forms of MS ages 10-17. This study would be conducted in two parts. The first part will be a PK and PD assessment of the genotyped based dosing in pediatric patients to confirm that systemic exposures at these does are similar to those of adult patients with those genotypes. In part two, the applicant should conduct a controlled, blinded trial with an appropriate comparator to satisfy this requirement.</p><p>The applicant will need to validate an assay for the CYP2C9 genotyping that is required to determine genotyping for maintenance dose and contraindication. This will be a postmarketing commitment. Presently, the applicant can rely on the CYP2C9 genotype assay currently marketed for determining genotype of CYP2C9 to determine appropriate warfarin therapy dose, but such use will be considered "off label" until the applicant can validate a commercially available assay for genotype in the context of siponimod therapy.
