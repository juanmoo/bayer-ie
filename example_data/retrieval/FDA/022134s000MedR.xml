<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"> <ref type="figure">BENEFIT ASSESSMENT .....................................</ref><p>is recommended for approval with the revised labeling identified in this review. The clinical studies contained in this submission support the use of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25% for the prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Risk Benefit Assessment</head><p>The results from the three efficacy trials (Protocols 05-003-11, 09-003-5, and 05-003-13), demonstrates a statistically significant and clinically relevant difference between alcaftadine ophthalmic solution and vehicle for the prevention of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.</p><p>The most frequent ocular adverse reactions, occurring in &lt; 4% of alcatfadine-treated eyes, were eye irritation, instillation site burning, eye redness, eye pruritus, and instillation site stinging. The most frequent non-ocular adverse reactions, occurring in &lt; 3% of subjects with alcaftadinetreated eyes, were nasopharyngitis, headache and influenza. Some of these events were similar to the underlying disease being studied.</p><p>The benefits of using this drug product outweigh the risks for the above indication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Recommendations for Postmarket Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies</head><p>There are no proposed risk management actions except the usual post-marketing collection and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the use of drug product.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Recommendations for Postmarket Requirements and Commitments</head><p>There are no recommended Phase 4 clinical study commitments.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Availability of Proposed Active Ingredient in the United States</head><p>There is no previous marketing experience on Lastacaft (alcaftadine ophthalmic solution) 0.25% as this product is not commercially available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Important Safety Issues With Consideration to Related Drugs</head><p>Adverse events for this class of drugs (topical H1 antagonists) are well known. Refer to Section 2.2 for currently approved products. Common side effects seen with this class include: headache, asthenia, blurry vision, eye burning/stinging upon instillation, eye pain, cold/flu symptoms, cough, fatigue, dry eye, foreign body sensation, lid edema, keratitis, hyperemia, nausea, phayrngitis, pruritis, rhinitis, sinusitis, sore throat, and taster perversion/bitter taste. There was adequate AE evaluation for alcaftadine in the submitted trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Summary of Presubmission Regulatory Activity Related to Submission</head><p>On November 24, 2003 a Pre-IND meeting was held for the clinical development plan for alcaftadine ophthalmic solution, 0.25% <ref type="bibr">(IND 66,</ref><ref type="bibr">884)</ref>.</p><p>On February 1, 2005 at the End-of-Phase 2 meeting it was agreed that subjects aged 3 and above would be included in a multi-center safety study. While allergic conjunctivitis commonly occurs in pediatric patients above the age of 3 years, it was agreed that pediatric patients less than 10 years of age can not reliably describe the subjective endpoint of itching and that the disease is the same in pediatric patients and adults. Therefore, the efficacy data established in those 10 years and above can be extrapolated down to 3 years of age. A partial waiver for those patients from 0 to 3 years was requested because studies are impossible or highly impractical given the number of pediatric patients 3 years of age or younger with allergic conjunctivitis is so small.</p><p>On February 24, 2010 a meeting was held with the Pediatric Research and Equity Act Waivers Committee. The committee concurred with a waiver for studies for the 0 to &lt; 3 year old age group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Other Relevant Background Information</head><p>A summary of the clinical studies forming the basis for approval for NDA 22-134 are: Studies 05-003-10, 05-003-11 and 05-003-13 were performed with the original formulation (#PD-F-3730). Study 05-003-10 was a safety trial in normal volunteers that included ages from 3 and above. (Refer to Section 7.0 Safety for complete results).</p><p>Studies 05-003-11 and 05-003-13 were efficacy trials using the CAC (Conjunctival Antigen Challenge) study model. Studies 05-003-11 and 05-003-13 included subjects age &gt; 10; it was agreed that subjects less than 10 years old can not reliably describe the subjective endpoint of itching. These trials were successful for itching but failed for ocular redness. (Refer to Section 6.0 Efficacy for complete results).</p><p>After having performed the above three studies (05-003-10, 05-003-11 and 05-003-13) the drug formulation was modified to include a reduction in the buffer concentration, preservative and chelating agent, that were made to improve overall comfort of the product. (Refer to Section 4.0 for drug formulation). With the change in formulation the agency requested an additional efficacy trial to support this change. Study 06-003-09 was an environmental study with the modified formulation.</p><p>The environmental study 06-003-09 enrolled a total of 365 subjects with a history of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. Many of the subjects enrolled exhibited no itching or redness during the course of the study, making it impossible to demonstrate a treatment effect; one-hundred (100) subjects had all "0" scores for ocular diary itching data and sixty (60) subjects had all "0" scores for ocular redness data during the 14-day peak pollen duration. Environmental study 06-003-09 failed both its endpoints of ocular itching and ocular redness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's comments:</head><p>It is not uncommon for environmental studies to fail for seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. As demonstrated in Study 06-003-09 many subjects may not illicit a response to the seasonal allergen, making it impossible to demonstrate any change in ocular itching or redness. Subjects may avoid exposure to the allergen by staying inside, or avoiding those areas in season where the allergen may be present.</p><p>After the failed environmental trial a Conjunctival Antigen Challenge (CAC) study (09-003-05) was performed with the modified formulation to demonstrate its efficacy. Using the controlled environment of the conjunctival antigen trial study, 09-003-05 was successful for its efficacy endpoint of ocular itching, though it failed for ocular redness. (Refer to Efficacy Section 6.0)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.4.3</head><p>Pharmacokinetics Following bilateral topical ocular administration of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25%, alcaftadine appears rapidly (median Tmax = 15 min) and briefly in the systemic circulation, falling below quantifiable plasma concentrations of 0.01 ng/mL by 3 hr after dosing. Maximum plasma concentrations achieved were below 0.12 ng/mL. The primary route of elimination of alcaftadine is metabolism to the active carboxylic acid metabolite, which occurs predominately via cytosolic enzymes. The active carboxylic acid metabolite reaches peak plasma concentrations of approximately 3 ng/mL by 1 hr after dosing and plasma concentrations fall near or below the minimum quantification limit (0.10 ng/mL) by 12 hr after dosing. The carboxylic acid metabolite has a dominant t½ of approximately 2 hr and based on data following oral administration, is primarily eliminated unchanged in the urine. There was no indication of accumulation or changes in pharmacokinetics of alcaftadine or the active carboxylic acid metabolite with multiple dosing. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Discussion of Individual Studies/Clinical Trials</head><p>The support of clinical efficacy for alcaftadine ophthalmic solution consisted of 3 Conjunctival Antigen Challenge clinical studies (05-003-11, 05-003-13 and 09-003-05). These three CAC studies are two day studies with the subjects instilling the medication once daily on Days 0 and 14 and then being challenged by an ocular antigen. A fourth clinical efficacy study (06-003-09) was a 6 week environmental trial that failed its endpoints but provides data for the safety database. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inclusion Criteria</head><p>To be eligible for the trial, subjects must have met all of the following criteria: 1. Males or females of any race at least 3 years of age at Visit 1 (Day 0, baseline). 2. Provided written informed consent and signed HIPAA form. Subjects who were at least 6 years of age and less than 18 years of age must have signed an assent form. In addition, all subjects below the age of 18 years were required to have a parent or legal guardian sign the informed consent. 3. Were willing and able to follow all instructions and attend all study visits. 4. Agreed to and submitted a urine sample for pregnancy testing at Visit 1 and upon exit from the study (if female and of childbearing potential). Childbearing potential was defined as any female who had her first menses, not had a hysterectomy or a bilateral tubal ligation, and had not been postmenopausal for at least 24 months. 5. Ocular health within normal limits, including a calculated best corrected (if necessary) visual acuity of 0.3 logMAR (logarithm of Minimum Angle of Resolution) or better, in each eye as measured using an ETDRS (Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study) chart. For subjects under the age of 10 years who were developmentally unable to use the ETDRS chart, a best attempt at visual acuity was made using LEA symbols. For these subjects, 20-foot Snellen equivalent units of 20/63 or better in both eyes was required.</p></div>

The primary efficacy variables for Environmental Study Protocol 06-003-09 were Diary Data (graded by subjects):</p><p>• Average* of daily evening ocular itching score • Average* of daily evening ocular redness score * Calculated based on data collected during the 14 consecutive days of peak pollen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's comments:</head><p>Of the 365 subjects enrolled, one-hundred (100) subjects had all "0" scores for ocular diary itching data during the 14-day peak pollen duration, and 60 subjects had all "0" scores for ocular redness data during the 14-day peak pollen duration. Many of the subjects exhibited no itching at all during the course of the study, making it difficult to show a treatment effect.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Indication</head><p>The proposed indication is the prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.1">Methods</head><p>The support for efficacy for alcaftadine ophthalmic solution comes from three studies: 05-003-11, 05-003-13 and 09-003-05. All three studies used the CAC model of acute conjunctivitis to determine the efficacy of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution, with CAC performed 15 minutes and 16 hours after study medication instillation.</p><p>The CAC model is a validated model that creates an allergic response similar to allergic response in an environmental setting. This model is well-accepted as a surrogate of the ocular symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis.</p><p>In the two studies 05-003-11 and 05-003-13, subjects were randomly assigned to one of the following treatment arms:</p><p>• Alcaftadine ophthalmic solution administered bilaterally • Alcaftadine ophthalmic solution in one eye and Vehicle (placebo) in the fellow eye (contralaterally) • Vehicle (placebo) ophthalmic solution administered bilaterally</p><p>In the study 09-003-05, subjects were randomly assigned to one of the following treatment arms:  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.3">Subject Disposition</head><p>The efficacy results are based on the ITT population for all randomized patients enrolled in the three CAC studies 05-003-11, 05-003-13 and 09-003-05. In all three efficacy studies (Protocols 05-003-11, 09-003-5, and 05-003-13), treatment with Alcaftadine ophthalmic solution once daily led to less ocular itching compared with Vehicle (placebo)-treated eyes when CAC was conducted 16 hours post study medication instillation at Visit 3 to assess duration of action (above <ref type="table">Table)</ref>, and 15 minutes post study medication instillation at Visit 4 to assess onset of action (above <ref type="table">Table)</ref>. With one exception, a difference of ~1 unit or greater in the mean ocular itching score was achieved for eyes treated with alcaftadine ophthalmic solution once daily compared with Vehicle (placebo)-treated eyes at all post allergen challenge time points at Visit 3 and Visit 4 in all four studies. The exception was the 3-minute post allergen challenge time point at Visit 3 in Protocol 05-003-11, where a difference of -0.865 in the mean ocular itching score was achieved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's comments:</head><p>To establish efficacy for itching of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution over Vehicle, mean difference scores (active minus vehicle-treated eye) of greater than 0.5 unit at all time points, with two of three time points demonstrating at least a 1 unit difference for ocular itching would be necessary.</p><p>The results from the three efficacy trials , demonstrate a statistically significant and clinically relevant difference between alcaftadine ophthalmic solution and vehicle for the prevention of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.</p></div>

Therefore, although statistical significance was noted at most time points, Alcaftadine ophthalmic solution was unable to clearly demonstrate clinical significance compared to Vehicle (placebo) in preventing conjunctival redness in the three efficacy studies (Protocols 05-003-11, 09-003-5, and 05-003-13).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7.4.5</head><p>Special Safety Studies/Clinical Trials Geriatric subjects &gt; 64 years of age were enrolled in the clinical studies throughout the drug's development process. The safety study (05-003-10) enrolled 34 geriatric subjects and the pivotal efficacy studies combined enrolled four subjects. No clinically significant observations in AE profile or ophthalmic assessment data could be made between elderly patients and younger patients across studies.</p><p>The safety study (05-003-10) allowed enrollment of pediatric subjects three years of age and older. The three CAC studies (05-003-13, 05-003-11 and 09-003-05) and the environmental study (06-003-09) permitted enrollment of pediatric subjects 10 years of age and older. The other studies in this program did not allow enrollment of subjects younger than 18 years of age. Alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25% was found to be safe and well-tolerated in the pediatric population 3-17 years of age with no unexpected safety issues in any pediatric subject. The type of ocular AEs (mainly eye redness and eye irritation) reported in the pediatric population were generally similar to those reported by the overall population in the study. Only one pediatric subject in the age group 11 to 17 years of age discontinued the study due to a TEAE (urticaria) that was non-ocular in nature and the investigator was doubtful that it was related to study medication. There were no clinically relevant findings on ophthalmic assessment data in the pediatric subjects. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>on Regulatory Action ............................................................. 5 1.2 Risk Benefit Assessment.................................................................................... 5 1.3 Recommendations for Postmarket Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies ... 5 1.4 Recommendations for Postmarket Requirements and Commitments ...............</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.2">Explorations for Dose Response</head><p>The only dose of alcafatdine studied in the safety and efficacy clinical trials was 0.25% administered once daily.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7.2.3</head><p>Special Animal and/or In Vitro Testing No special animal or in vitro testing was performed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7.2.4</head><p>Routine Clinical Testing Following bilateral topical ocular administration of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25%, alcaftadine appears rapidly (median T max = 15 min) and briefly in the systemic circulation, falling below quantifiable plasma concentrations of 0.01 ng/mL by 3 hr after dosing. Maximum plasma concentrations achieved were below 0.12 ng/mL. The primary route of elimination of alcaftadine is metabolism to the active carboxylic acid metabolite, which occurs predominately via cytosolic enzymes. The active carboxylic acid metabolite reaches peak plasma concentrations of approximately 3 ng/mL by 1 hr after dosing and plasma concentrations fall near or below the minimum quantification limit (0.10 ng/mL) by 12 hr after dosing. The carboxylic acid metabolite has a dominant t ½ of approximately 2 hr and based on data following oral administration, is primarily eliminated unchanged in the urine. There was no indication of accumulation or changes in pharmacokinetics of alcaftadine or the active carboxylic acid metabolite with multiple dosing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7.2.5</head><p>Metabolic, Clearance, and Interaction Workup Refer to Section 7.2.4. No clinically noteworthy laboratory abnormalities were detected in any subject during the laboratory evaluation in the pK study.</p></div>

Refer to Section 2.2 for currently approved products. Common side effects include for this class include: headache, asthenia, blurry vision, eye burning/stinging upon instillation, eye pain, cold/flu symptoms, cough, fatigue, dry eye, foreign body sensation, lid edema, keratitis, hyperemia, nausea, phayrngitis, pruritis, rhinitis, sinusitis, sore throat, taste perversion/bitter taste.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7.3.1</head><p>Deaths No deaths were reported in any clinical trial in this development process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7.3.2</head><p>Nonfatal Serious Adverse Events There were ten subjects that experienced a serious adverse event during the drug development. None of the events were considered to be related to the study medication. Five of the subjects In summary, the safety trial enrolled a total of 114 pediatric subjects of which 77 subjects received alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25%. Of these 77 pediatric subjects, 48 were between 3−10 years of age and 29 were between 11−17 years of age. The three Phase 3 CAC studies, combined, enrolled 23 pediatric subjects 11−17 years of age. Although the number of pediatric subjects studied in this program was relatively small, the safety and efficacy data obtained on this population was no different than the data obtained on adult subjects.</p></div>

There were no significant differences between alcaftaidine ophthalmic solution 0.25% and the vehicle group with regards to age, gender, ethnicity, eye color or race.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7.5.4</head><p>Drug-Disease Interactions Alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25% was evaluated for the prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis, and no drug-disease interaction was performed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.5.5">Drug-Drug Interactions</head><p>No studies were conducted to evaluate a drug-drug interaction between alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25% and any of the concomitant medications allowed in those studies. The low systemic absorption of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25% would limit the potential for drug interaction.</p><p>During the course of the safety studies there were no reports of drug interactions. The sponsor applied for a waiver for carcinogenicity testing. A waiver for carcinogenicity testing was granted on September 13, 2006.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7.6.2</head><p>Human Reproduction and Pregnancy Data Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses of up to 2800 times and 5600 times the human dose respectively, and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to alcaftadine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><p>It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25% is administered to a nursing woman.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7.6.3</head><p>Pediatrics and Assessment of Effects on Growth This drug was tested on a pediatric population. Height was not collected as part of this protocol.</p></div>
