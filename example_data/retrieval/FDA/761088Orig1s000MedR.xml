<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In the May 2018 resubmission, Celltrion did not seek licensure for any other indications listed in the currently approved US-Rituxan label.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviews</head><p>The Product Quality Summary review concluded that CT-P10 is highly similar to US-Rituxan notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components. Although minor differences in size variant profile, charge variant profile, deamidation, and glycosylation profile were observed, additional data and scientific justifications support that these differences do not preclude a finding that CT-P10 is highly similar to US-Rituxan. All previously identified product quality deficiencies in the complete response letter were resolved.</p><p>The Nonclinical review noted that the results of the comparative repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomologus monkeys and tissue cross-reactivity study supported the demonstration of biosimilarity and concluded that the application was approvable.</p><p>The Clinical Pharmacology review recommended approval of CT-P10 based on a demonstration of pharmacokinetic (PK) similarity and no increase in immunogenicity risk between CT-P10 and US-Rituxan as demonstrated in Study CT -P10 3.2. Also included in the May 2018 resubmission was new pharmacokinetic information from the comparative clinical study CT-P10 3.4 conducted in patients with low tumor burden follicular lymphoma. In study CT-P10 3.4, there were no apparent differences in Cmax and Ctrough values between CT-P10 and US-licensed Rituxan.</p><p> Relapsed or refractory, low grade or follicular, CD20-positive B-cell NHL as a single agent.  Previously untreated follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL in combination with first line chemotherapy and, in patients achieving a complete or partial response to a rituximab product in combination with chemotherapy, as single-agent maintenance therapy.  Non-progressing (including stable disease), low-grade, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL as a single agent after first-line cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) chemotherapy.</p><p>Clinical and Statistical Review Rachel Ershler, MD Xin Gao, PhD BLA 761088 CTP-10 (Truxima)     </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Introduction and Regulatory Background</head><p>Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) is the most common hematological malignancy in adults, with B-cell lymphomas comprising more than 80% of all NHLs. In 2018, it is estimated there will be more than 74,000 new cases of NHL including approximately 20,000 deaths (1). Since its U.S. approval in 1997, rituximab is widely considered to be a substantial advancement in the management of these malignancies. Multiple clinical studies have demonstrated the favorable impact of rituximab on treatment, survival, and long-term outcomes of patients with NHL and leukemia. There are currently no approved biosimilars to US-Rituxan ® .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key Exclusion Criteria</head><p>A patient meeting any of the following criteria was excluded from the study: In the Federico historical study, the ORR in the US-Rituxan ® contained group was 88%. Based on the difference between these two studies, the 7% non-inferiority margin was selected.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0"></formula><p>A post hoc calculation was also done to estimate the non-inferiority margin based on the Marcus 2005 study 2 , which is considered the only one relevant randomized study in the AFL setting. With the estimated risk difference of 0.24 (95% CI [0.145, 0.341]), a NI margin -7% preserved approximately 50% of the treatment effect of US-Rituxan ® , based on the lower bound of the 95% CI.</p></div>

Most notable were global protocol amendments related to study eligibility criteria and statistical considerations in the amendment dated July 24, 2014.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Changes to the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)</head><p>The protocol stated that the per protocol population (PP) was defined as all randomly assigned patients who had at least one response evaluation after receiving at least one treatment cycle in the Core Study Period, and who did not have any major protocol violations, including a violation of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. To clarify the major protocol violation of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the list of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, which has an impact on efficacy analysis, were presented in the SAP to define the PP population before the first database lock. Statistical Reviewer Comments: Several major issues with study CT-P10 3.3 were identified during the review. First, the Agency considers that an equivalence design is generally more appropriate than a non-inferiority design to demonstrate that there are no clinically meaningful differences for this patient population. Second, study CT-P10 3.3 is designed to demonstrate non-inferiority only, and it is likely underpowered to demonstrate equivalence of CT-P10 vs. US-Rituxan ® . Lastly, the sensitivity of the advanced follicular lymphoma population to detect differences between products could be influenced by the presence of concurrent background chemotherapy. The study design is depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> below.   For both male and female patients and their partners of childbearing potential, patient agrees to practice total abstinence or to use one of the following medically acceptable methods of contraception during the course of the study and for 12 months following discontinuation of study drug (excluding women who are not of childbearing potential and men who have been sterilized): -Barrier contraceptives -Hormonal contraceptives -Intrauterine devices Male or female patients and their partners who have been surgically sterilized for less than 6 months prior to the first administration of the study drug must agree to use 1 medically acceptable method of contraception or practice total abstinence during study treatment. Menopausal female must have experienced their last period more than 12 months prior to study entry to be classified as not of childbearing potential. For both premenopausal women and women who are less than or equal to 12 months after the onset of menopause, patient has a negative serum pregnancy test during the Screening period.  Adequate bone marrow, hepatic and renal function, as evidenced by:</p></div>

Patients who were planning to be pregnant or to breastfeed before, during, or within 12 months after the last infusion of study treatment were not permitted to enroll into the study.  History of a live, live-attenuated, or non-live vaccine within 4 weeks before the first administration of the drug.  Evidence of any other coexisting disease or medical or psychological condition, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicated the use of an investigational product, or patient was a high risk for treatment complications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Plan</head><p>Determination of Sample Size A sample size of 174 patients (87 patients in each treatment group) was planned with 91% power to demonstrate equivalence of CT-P10 vs. US-Rituxan ® using ORR up to 7 months. This calculation was based on an ORR of 88% in the US-Rituxan ® treated group and an equivalence margin of ±17%, using a 2-sided 90% CI approach.</p><p>During the trial, the actual dropout rate and pooled ORR were assessed in a blinded manner at the DSMB meeting when the primary endpoint evaluation was available with 102 (53.7%) evaluable patients. A reassessment of sample size accounting for the actual dropout rate and the observed ORR was done in a blinded manner, and the sample size was increased to at least 238 patients (maximum 250) to achieve 80% power for the study.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">4</ref> . The historical efficacy of rituximab based on the difference in ORRs between the patients treated with rituximab and patients in the "watch and wait" group was 82%, with 95% CI of (0.75, 0.88). Therefore, the historical treatment effect of rituximab for the equivalence trial was conservatively estimated as 75%. By applying a 77% preservation rate, the equivalence margin was proposed as ±17%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis Populations</head><p>The Intent to Treat (ITT) population and per-protocol (PP) population were considered in the analysis. The ITT population was defined as all patients enrolled and randomly assigned to receive a study drug, regardless of whether or not any study drug dosing was completed. The PP population was defined as all patients who were randomly assigned and had at least one response evaluation after receiving at least one dose (full) of study drug in the Induction Study Period, without any major protocol violation or deviation that may have affected the interpretation of study results. Patients in the PP population were analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were randomized by IWRS or IVRS, and not according to what they actually received.</p></div>

The estimated ORR difference was 5.7% (90% CI, -1.7%, 14.7%). The lower bound of the 90% CI was greater than the proposed non-inferiority margin, therefore the study met the primary objective for noninferiority. However, the study was not designed to demonstrate equivalence. Inference about equivalence would be post-hoc and likely underpowered in this study.</p><p>Study CT-P10 3.4 used an equivalence design for the primary endpoint of ORR with equivalence margins of ±17%. The estimated ORR difference of 1.8% (90% CI, -6.16%, 10.02%) lies within the equivalence margins. Therefore, the study demonstrated the equivalence of CT-P10 vs. US-Rituxan ® . The results of tipping point analysis showed that the analysis result was robust with respect to the missing data.</p><p>6.1 Study CT-P10 3.3</p></div>

Due to the differences between the two studies in regards to patient population and treatment duration, an integrated analysis of the safety results was not performed. The safety populations for both studies consisted of all subjects who received at least one (full or partial) dose of study drug. Overall, there were slight numerical differences identified between the two treatment groups in both clinical studies. However, these were unlikely to be clinically meaningful. The majority of the adverse events reported in both of the studies were expected given the known biologic effects of rituximab. The most common adverse events in patients with advanced follicular lymphoma were neutropenia, infusion related reactions, constipation and upper respiratory infections. The most common adverse events in patients with low tumor burden follicular lymphoma were infusion related reactions, fatigue, diarrhea and upper respiratory infections.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Study CT-P10 3.3</formula><p>The Safety Analysis set consisted of 140 subjects with advanced follicular lymphoma who received at least 1 dose of CT-P10 (n=70) or Rituxan ® (n=70).</p><p>The majority of subjects in both treatment groups experienced at least one adverse event.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Reviewer Comment:</head><p>In study CT-P10 3.3, there were more subjects who experienced Grade 3 and higher adverse events and SAEs in the CT-P10 treatment group. However, the trial design was such at that the numbers were small and did not allow for a rigorous assessment of safety comparisons between the two treatment groups. In addition, the differences observed were likely confounded by the use of CVP backbone chemotherapy, as well as differences in the baseline occurrence of bone marrow involvement of disease. Study CT-P10 3.4 included a larger patient population and the results were not confounded by the use of concomitant chemotherapy. The Clinical and Statistical Review Rachel Ershler, MD Xin Gao, PhD BLA 761088 CTP-10 (Truxima) differences in safety findings in study CT-P10 3.4 were not as pronounced.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>On April 28, 2017, Celltrion, Inc. (Applicant) submitted BLA 761088 for CT-P10 as a proposed biosimilar product to US-licensed Rituxan (rituximab). BLA 761088 was submitted for the purpose of licensure of CT-P10 under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act. The proposed indications for CT-P10 are as follows:</p><p>• Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL)</p><p>The proposed dosing regimens, which are the same as US-licensed Rituxan are as follows:</p><p>• The dose for NHL is 375 mg/m 2 .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Source: Derived in part from the reviews by Drs. Shah, Manning, Travis and Freeman</head><p>Rituximab is a chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody that binds the CD20 antigen expressed on the surface of pre-B and mature B-lymphocytes. After binding to CD20 on the cell surface, rituximab is believed to mediate B cell lysis, possibly through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and/or direct induction of apoptosis. The applicant conducted a 3-way analytical similarity assessment of CT-P10, Rituxan, and MabThera, including studies for cell-basedCD20 binding affinity, ADCC, ADCP, CDC, and apoptosis and studies that measured FcγR binding affinities, FcRn binding affinity, and C1q binding affinity. The results of the 3-way analytical similarity assessment support establishment of a scientific bridge between CT-P10, Rituxan, and MabThera.</p><p>The regulatory history pertaining to the development of CT-P10 is detailed below.</p><p>• March 19, 2014: BPD Type 2 Meeting (PIND 120885) to discuss development of CT-P10 as a proposed biosimilar to US-licensed Rituxan. The applicant conducted a stepwise biosimilar development program intended to demonstrate that CT-P10 is highly similar to Rituxan notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between CT-P10 and US-licensed Rituxan in terms of safety, purity, or potency. The biosimilar development program consists of an analytical similarity assessment and abbreviated nonclinical and clinical programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">CMC/Device</head><p>Source: Derived in part from the CMC Executive Summary Review.</p><p>CT-P10 is produced in genetically engineered CHO cells. CT-P10 drug product, Truxima, is manufactured to the same concentration, formulation, and presentation as U.S.licensed Rituxan. Truxima is a sterile, preservative-free, colorless to pale yellow, clear to Reference ID: 4227982 (b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(4)</ref> opalescent solution for intravenous infusion and supplied in single-dose vials containing CT-P10 at 100 mg/10 mL or 500 mg/50 mL.</p><p>The Office of Pharmaceutical Quality (OPQ), CDER, has completed review of STN 761088 for TRUXIMA manufactured by Celltrion, Inc. The data submitted in the application are not sufficient to support a conclusion that the manufacture of TRUXIMA is well-controlled and will lead to a product that is pure and potent for the duration of the shelf-life. From a CMC standpoint, the Office of Biotechnology Products (OBP)/OPQ is recommending a Complete Response letter be issued to Celltrion to outline the deficiencies and the information and data that will be required to support approval.</p><p>From an immunogenicity perspective, the immunogenicity assays are not sufficiently sensitive to detect anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing antibodies (NAb) in presence of CT-P10 at plasma concentrations observed in patients with Advanced Stage Follicular Lymphoma (AFL). Although the insufficiently-sensitive assays rendered the immunogenicity results in patients with AFL unreliable, we do not believe that an immunogenicity assessment in these patients would yield potentially meaningful data. The Division of Hematology Products and the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Rheumatology Products agree that such an assessment in patients with AFL is not necessary because the rheumatoid arthritis population is the appropriate population for evaluating immunogenicity in this case. The assays are acceptable for testing of ADAs and NAbs in the samples from patients with rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>Per Division of Inspectional Assessment (DIA)/OPF/OPQ, the application cannot be approved during this review cycle due to facility deficiencies. A pre-license inspection of TRUXIMA drug substance and drug product manufacturing facility could not be conducted due to Official Action Indicated (OAI) status associated with a Warning Letter (WL 320-18-28) issued to Celltrion. The Division of Inspectional Assessment, OPF, OPQ is recommending a withhold status, and a Complete Response letter be issued to Celltrion.</p><p>The Division of Microbiology Assessment/ OPF/OPQ is recommending a Complete Response letter be issued to Celltrion.</p><p>From an analytical similarity perspective, OBP/OPQ has determined that the analytical similarity data as presented in the BLA is acceptable to support the conclusions that:</p><p>• The biological product, CT-P10, is highly similar to U.S.-licensed Rituxan, • A sufficient scientific bridge was established to support the use of E.U.-approved MabThera as a comparator in clinical studies supporting this application.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Source: Pharmacology/Toxicology Review by Drs. Manning and Sheth</head><p>The results of the in vitro 3-way similarity assessment, the tissue cross-reactivity study, and the comparative repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys support the demonstration of biosimilarity between CT-P10 and Rituxan. From the perspective of nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology, CT-P10 may be approved for the proposed indications.</p></div>

Part 1 of Study CT-P10 3.2 was a randomized, controlled, double-blind, 3-arm parallel study to compare the PK of CT-P10, USlicensed Rituxan and EU-approved MabThera (MabThera) in 189 patients with RA. The 90% confidence intervals (CI) for all three pairwise comparisons of AUC0-last, AUC0-inf and AUC0-14 were within the PK similarity acceptance criteria of 80 to 125% <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>. The results of the study established the PK similarity between CT-P10 and US-licensed Rituxan. The study also established the PK portion of the scientific bridge between CT-P10, US-licensed Rituxan, and MabThera, which supports the use of MabThera in the comparative clinical study portion within Study CT-P10 3.2.</p><p>The incidence of immunogenicity for CT-P10 and US-licensed Rituxan was compared in a multiple-dose, parallel-arm study in patients with RA (Study CT-P10 3.2). The results indicate similar incidence and titers of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) for both products. The incidence of ADA at Week 24 was 14.9% and 23.2% for CT-P10 and US-licensed Rituxan, respectively. While the development of ADAs appears to decrease exposure of the products, the impact of ADAs on PK was similar between treatment groups. No apparent impact of ADA on safety and efficacy was observed in Study CT-P10 3.2. Therefore, the data indicates that there is no increase in immunogenicity risk for CT-P10 as compared to US-licensed Rituxan, which supports the demonstration that there are no clinically meaningful differences between CT-P10 and US-licensed Rituxan in patients with RA.</p><p>The Office of Clinical Pharmacology recommends approval of CT-P10 based on demonstration of PK similarity between CT-P10 and US-licensed Rituxan in patients with RA.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Source: DPARP Division Review</head><p>In Study CT-P10 3.2, the primary endpoint, change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) at week 24 was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) which included treatment, study part, sex, region, race, reason for discontinuing prior anti-TNF therapy, and screening RF or anti-CCP status as factors. Since the randomization was modified between parts 1 and 2 of the study, the Agency requested that the Applicant additionally include a treatment by interaction term to the model. The Applicant's primary analysis included only patients who completed the Week 24 visit.</p><p>CT-P10 met the pre-specified similarity margin. The DPARP statistical review team notes that the Applicant's primary analysis excluded patients who failed to complete the study, which the Agency did not believe is appropriate. However, revised tipping point analyses, intended to address this limitation, confirm that the conclusions are robust in the face of missing data, with implausible assumptions required to reverse the conclusion of biosimilarity.</p><p>Similarity of CT-P10 to the combined comparator products is further supported by analyses of DAS28 (ESR), individual components of DAS28, and ACR-20, 50 and 70 response rates. The analyses showed a relatively small difference between the CT-P10 treatment and comparator treatment arms compared to overall changes from baseline. Further, the analyses of ACR20 response rates met a similarity margin of ±12%, which is within the FDA-recommended margin for similarity when this endpoint is used as a primary endpoint in comparative clinical studies in RA.</p><p>Overall, the DPARP statistical review team concluded that the results from the comparative clinical study 3.2 support a demonstration of no clinically meaningful differences between CT-P10 and US-licensed Rituxan, and add to the totality of the evidence to support a demonstration of biosimilarity of CT-P10 and US-licensed Rituxan.</p><p>From a DPARP clinical perspective, the submitted clinical data in RA are adequate to: 1) Support the demonstration of PK similarity between CT-P10 and US-licensed Rituxan.</p><p>2) Establish the PK component of the scientific bridge to justify the relevance of the data generated using EU-approved MabThera to support the demonstration of biosimilarity of CT-P10 to US-licensed Rituxan. 3) Support a demonstration that there are no clinically meaningful differences between CT-P10 and US-licensed Rituxan in terms of safety, purity, and potency in the indication studied. 4) Support the safety of a clinical scenario where non-treatment naïve patients may undergo a single transition to CT-P10 based on the similar safety or immunogenicity profile between patients undergoing a single transition from US-licensed Rituxan or EU-approved MabThera to CT-P10 as compared to those who continued treatment with comparator product.</p></div>

The study was not designed to show equivalence. The study was designed to show non-inferiority of CT-P10 compared to US-licensed Rituxan, even though the study was under-powered for the pre-specified noninferiority margin of 7%. The observed ORR difference between the arms was 5.7% and the 90% confidence interval was [-1.7%, 14.7%]. The lower 90% confidence interval of observed difference in ORR was greater than the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 7%. Therefore, the primary objective was met for non-inferiority of ORR. However, the 90% upper bound of the difference does not rule out non-superiority. The time-to-event secondary endpoints were not available at the data cut-off because the data were not mature.</p><p>From the DHP clinical and statistical perspective, there were concerns that the results of the clinical study CT-P10 3.3 may not provide support of a demonstration of no clinically meaningful differences between CT-P10 and the reference product Rituxan for the targeted oncology population. The difference observed in ORR between CT-P10 and Rituxan create uncertainty as to whether there are no clinically meaningful differences between CT-P10 and Rituxan. Celltrion did not provide adequate information and justification to resolve this uncertainty.

No new safety signals were identified in the CT-P10 group compared to the known adverse event profile of US-licensed Rituxan. Overall, there were no major differences in adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), or AEs leading to discontinuations between the treatment groups. The total number of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) was higher in the CT-P10 arm (77.6%) than in the US-licensed Rituxan (64.2%) or EU-approved MabThera (65.0%) in the Main study Period of study 3.2 with an increase in the number of infusion related reactions. The nature and severity of the infusion related reactions are similar across treatment groups and are consistent with known safety profile of US-licensed Rituxan. Other adverse events of special interest (AESI) were generally similar across treatment arms. Infections were the most common adverse event in all treatment groups and no difference was seen in infections between treatment groups. One death was reported in the Study 3.2 Main Study Period.</p><p>The DHP clinical safety review was primarily based on review of data from Study CT-P10 3.3, a phase 1/3, randomized, parallel-group, active-controlled, double-blind study to demonstrate equivalence of PK and noninferiority of efficacy for CT-P10 in comparison with Rituxan, each administered in combination with CVP in patients with advanced follicular lymphoma. There were 70 patients in each arm of the study (N=140). Key safety findings from Study CT-P10 3.3, and from the supportive safety database:</p><p>• Deaths: There was 1 death (1 in the CT-P10 group and 0 in the Rituxan group) within 30 days of study treatment attributable to tumor lysis syndrome. • Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Discontinuations: Overall, SAEs were more common in CT-P10 group. These were more frequent in the CT-P10 group across a number of SOCs. Compared with Rituxan (12.9%), 22.9% patients experienced at least one SAE. There were more patients with at least one TEAE leading to permanent study drug discontinuation in the CT-P10 group vs. Rituxan group (7.1% vs. 1.4%).</p></div>

The patient had a history of coronary artery disease, cerebral atherosclerosis and hypertension prior to study enrollment. The causes of death was reported as cardiac and renal failure. An autopsy was not performed. The event of tumour lysis syndrome was considered by the investigator to be possibly related to CT-P10 and cyclophosphamide, and unrelated to vincristine and prednisolone.</p><p>This death is possibly attributable to CT-P10.</p><p>Summary of Deaths (All causes) after 30 Days of Last Dose (CT-P10 group) Two patients in the CT-P10 group died due to disease progression. The CRFs and narratives for these patients were reviewed in detail:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subject</head><p>was a 41 year old female who received 2 cycles of CT-P10 plus CVP on and who was subsequently discontinued from the study on due to disease progression and declining health. After study discontinuation, the patient received a total of 4 cycles of rituximab treatment in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone starting on until her death on due to disease progression, 166 days following protocol discontinuation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subject</head><p>was a 61 year old female who received 4 cycles of CT-P10 plus CVP from until , but was discontinued from the study due to multiple infusion related reactions. After the study drug CT-P10 discontinuation, the patient received an additional 4 cycles of CVP only and entered the Follow-up Period. During the Follow-up Period, the patient was treated with R-CVP and Ibrutinib in combination with CHOP as a salvage treatment and died due to lymphoma on , 351 days from the last study drug administration. Overall, TESAEs were more frequent in the CT-P10 group across a number of SOCs; there does not appear to be a clinically meaningful clustering of events. These TESAEs are summarized by SOC and PT in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 14</ref>. Reviewer comment: There did not appear to be a clinically significant pattern among the observed TEAEs leading to permanent study drug discontinuation. Overall, Grade 3 or higher TEAEs were more frequent in the CT-P10 group. Twenty-six (37.1%) and 20 (28.6%) patients experienced one or more Grade 3 or higher TEAE in the CT-P10 and Rituxan arms, respectively. Notably, Grade 3 or higher neutropenia was more frequent in the CT-P10 group (25.7% vs. 15.7% Rituxan group) as was pneumonia (5.7% vs 0% in the Rituxan group). These Grade 3 or higher TEAEs are summarized by SOC and PT in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 19</ref>. The number (%) of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE of febrile neutropenia was 2 (2.9%) patients in both treatment groups. Reviewer comment: All-grade neutropenia and Grade 3 or higher neutropenia were more frequent in the CT-P10 arm. Of note, more patients in the CT-P10 treatment group had bone marrow involvement at baseline (45 [64.3%] patients in the CT-P10 treatment group versus 33 [47.1%] patients in the Rituxan treatment group). Furthermore, among the patients with TEAE of neutropenia, 18 patients in the CT-P10 treatment group and 7 patients in the Rituxan treatment group had bone marrow involvement at baseline. This suggests that the observed differences in incidence of neutropenia may be attributable to differences in baseline bone marrow involvement.</p></div>
