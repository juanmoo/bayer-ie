					<note>Clinical Review/Addendum Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 2 1 Recommendations/Risk Benefit Assessment From a clinical reviewer&apos;s perspective, the approval of sofosbuvir is recommended for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection in adults. Please refer to Primary Clinical Review (dated September 06, 2013) for detailed assessment of the data from four Phase 3 trials (P7977-1231, GS-US-334-0107, GS-US-334-0108, and GS-US-334-0110) submitted in the original NDA application. This addendum includes review of additional interim data submitted from two ongoing Phase 3 trials (GS-US-334-0123 and GS-US-334-0133) evaluating sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin. The overall risk benefit assessment for sofosbuvir remains favorable. No deficiencies in the submitted/reviewed data preclude recommendation for approval of sofosbuvir at this time. Clinical Review/Addendum Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 5 Subsequent to the Primary Clinical Review, the Applicant made us aware of the emerging data from ongoing trials and their plans to present the data at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) annual Meeting to be held November 1 st -November 5 th , 2013 in Washington D.C. These assessments led to submission and review of data from the two ongoing trials, GS-US-334-0133 (VALENCE) and GS-US-334-0123 (PHOTON-1) discussed in this review. 3 Ethics and Good Clinical Practices As noted in the Clinical Review signed on September 06, 2013, the Applicant noted that all trials conducted in the sofosbuvir development program met the requirement for International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines. One of the trials included in this review is a non-IND trial (GS-US-334-0133) being conducted in Europe. The Applicant (Gilead) confirmed that Study GS-US-334-0133 (VALENCE) has met the requirements outlined under 21 CFR § 312.120(a)(1). Please refer to Cross Discipline Team Leader (CDTL) Memo by Dr. Sarah Connelly (signed November 08, 2013) which addresses the applicability of available clinical data from trial GS-US-334-0133 (VALENCE) to U.S. population. The Applicant noted that a FDA Form 3455 was not included in submission dated October 09, 2013 for Study GS-US-334-0133 (VALENCE) as there are no Principal Investigators or Subinvestigators who have a financial interest with Gilead Sciences, Inc. 4 Significant Efficacy/Safety Issues Related To Other Review Disciplines Clinical Review/Addendum Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 6 Please refer to CDTL Memo by Dr. Sarah Connelly which summarizes the pertinent issues related to other review disciplines. Please refer to respective discipline review addenda for detailed assessments.</note>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The highlights of the GS-US-334-0133 (VALENCE) data shared by the Applicant appeared promising and supported longer treatment duration (24 weeks of SOF+RBV) for genotype 3 subjects. From a public health perspective, approving a suboptimal regimen when the emerging data is already available for 24 week treatment duration would not be beneficial for patients and would unduly expose patients to a suboptimal therapy. Taking these factors into consideration, a decision was made to review the currently available data from VALENCE trial during current review cycle rather than waiting for the trial completion and subsequent submission of data as an efficacy supplement.</p><p>The highlights of the GS-US-334-0123 (PHOTON-1) data supported a treatment option (24 weeks of SOF+RBV) for interferon-ineligible genotype 1 patients and provided safety and efficacy data in the HCV/HIV co-infected patient population.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Introduction and Regulatory Background</head><p>Sofosbuvir (SOF) is a nucleotide inhibitor of hepatitis C virus NS5B RNAdependent RNA polymerase inhibitor. Sofosbuvir is the first-drug-in class submitted for marketing application in the United States. The original NDA Application was submitted on April 06, 2013 and is currently under priority review. Breakthrough therapy designation was granted for sofosbuvir on October 10, 2013 under the IND 106739.</p><p>An Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee Meeting was convened on October 25, 2013 to discuss NDA 204671. The committee members unanimously voted to support approval of sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin for treatment of chronic hepatitis C in adult patients with genotypes 2 and 3 infection and to support approval of sofosbuvir in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin for treatment of chronic hepatitis C in treatment-naïve adult patients with genotypes 1 and 4 infection. Please refer to AC transcripts for detailed information.</p><p>At the time of Primary Clinical Review, the primary clinical data supporting the use of sofosbuvir (SOF) in combination with ribavirin (RBV) for the treatment of genotypes 2 and 3 HCV infection was derived from three registrational Phase 3 trials.</p><p>• P7977-1231 (FISSION) evaluated SOF+RBV treatment for 12 weeks in treatment-naïve subjects • GS-US-334-0107 (POSITRON) evaluated SOF+RBV for 12 weeks in subjects who were interferon intolerant, ineligible, or unwilling to take interferon • GS-US-334-0108 (FUSION) evaluated SOF+RBV for 12 or 16 weeks in treatment-experienced subjects Clinical Review/Addendum Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671</p><p>4 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 1</ref> shows the differences in SVR12 between genotypes 2 and 3 across three Phase 3 trials submitted in original NDA submission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1: SVR12 Rates for Genotypes 2 and 3</head><p>Source: FDA Presentation, Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee Meeting <ref type="bibr">October 25, 2013</ref> As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 1</ref>, SVR12 rates for GT3 subjects were consistently lower than GT2 subjects across all three trials. FUSION trial (shown on the right most side of the figure) demonstrated that GT3 treatment-experienced subjects receiving SOF+RBV for 16 weeks had significantly increased SVR12 rates compared with the same regimen for 12 weeks, 62% versus 30%, respectively.</p><p>Reviewer's Comments SVR12 rates for HCV genotype 3 subjects were consistently lower than HCV genotype 2 subjects across all three trials submitted for original NDA review. Reduced response rates in genotype 3 subjects were driven by high relapse rates, indicating that extending the duration of therapy may improve SVR. FUSION demonstrated genotype 3 treatment-experienced subjects receiving SOF+RBV for 16 weeks had significantly increased SVR12 rates compared with the SOF+RBV regimen for 12 weeks, 62% versus 30%, respectively, as well as lower relapse rates (38% versus 66%, respectively). The collective evidence from the Phase 3 trials indicated that 12 or 16 weeks of SOF+RBV is not the optimal regimen for HCV genotype 3 patients and the SVR12 rates can be further optimized by longer treatment duration in genotype 3 patient population.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Review of Efficacy</head><p>The trial design and the efficacy results for the two ongoing Phase 3 trials (GS-US-334-0133 and GS-US-334-0123) reviewed in this addendum are summarized in this section.</p><p>The treatment regimen evaluated in both trials was SOF+RBV for 12 or 24 weeks in duration. SOF 400 mg was administered once daily and weight-based RBV (total daily dose of 1000 or 1200 mg) was administered in a divided daily dose.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was defined as the proportion of subjects who attained SVR12 defined as HCV RNA &lt; lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) (i.e., &lt; 25 IU/mL) at 12 weeks after study drug cessation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nomenclature Used for Virologic Failures</head><p>On-treatment virologic failure (breakthrough, rebound, and nonresponse) and relapse was defined as follows:</p><p>• On treatment failure -Breakthrough: HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ after having previously had HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ, while on treatment, confirmed with two consecutive values (note, second confirmation value could be posttreatment), or last available on-treatment measurement with no subsequent follow up values -Rebound: &gt; 1 log 10 IU/mL increase in HCV RNA from nadir while on treatment, confirmed with two consecutive values (note, second confirmation value could be posttreatment), or last available ontreatment measurement with no subsequent follow up values Clinical Review/Addendum Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 7 -Nonresponse: HCV RNA persistently ≥ LLOQ through the treatment (definition of non response varied between the four phase 3 trials based on treatment regimen and duration)</p><p>• Relapse -HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ during the posttreatment period having achieved HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at the last observed HCV RNA measurement on treatment, confirmed with two consecutive values or last available posttreatment measurement</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GS-US-334-0133 (VALENCE)</head><p>Trial Design GS-US-334-0133 (VALENCE) is an ongoing Phase 3 non-IND European trial evaluating SOF+RBV for the treatment of HCV genotypes 2 or 3 infection in treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced subjects, including subjects with compensated cirrhosis, with treatment durations of 12 or 24 weeks, depending on HCV genotype.</p><p>The primary objectives of this study are as follows:</p><p>• To determine the efficacy of treatment with SOF+RBV as measured by the proportion of subjects with sustained viral response 12 weeks after discontinuation of therapy (SVR12)</p><p>• To assess the safety and tolerability of SOF+RBV as measured by review of the accumulated safety data</p><p>The protocol was originally designed as a comparison between SOF+RBV or placebo for 12 weeks with the primary endpoint of SVR12. The original trial design for Study GS-US-334-0133 is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>Following review of the sofosbuvir Phase 3 data from Study GS-US-334-0108 (FUSION) demonstrating the benefit of the longer treatment duration, GS-US-334-0133 was amended so that all subjects with HCV GT3 who had not already completed treatment had their treatment duration extended to 24 weeks ( <ref type="figure">Figure  3</ref>). At this stage, the trial was also unblinded, and subjects initially randomized to receive placebo were discontinued from the trial and offered treatment under a separate protocol (GS-US-334-0109). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disposition</head><p>All genotype 2 subjects (N=73) who received SOF+RBV for 12 weeks completed the treatment as planned. Eleven HCV genotype 3 subjects who were originally randomized to the 12-week SOF+RBV group completed 12 weeks of treatment as planned and did not extend the treatment duration. Two hundred fifty genotype 3 subjects who were originally randomized to the SOF+RBV 12 Week group and were still receiving treatment had the treatment duration extended to 24 weeks. Only 2% of the 250 HCV genotype 3 subjects who received SOF+RBV for 24 weeks discontinued the study medication.</p><p>Clinical Review/Addendum Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 9  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref> summarizes the demographic and baseline characteristics for all subjects in the safety analysis set.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographics and Baseline Characteristics</head><p>Among the 73 HCV genotype 2 subjects who received 12 weeks of SOF+RBV, the mean age (SD) was 58 (10) years old. Fifty-five percent of the subjects were male, 89% were white, and 89% were non-Hispanic. The mean BMI (SD) at baseline was 26 (4) kg/m 2 .</p><p>Among the 250 HCV genotype 3 subjects who received 24 weeks of SOF+RBV, the average age (SD) was 48 (10) years old.

The mean BMI (SD) was 25 (4) kg/m 2 .</p><p>Clinical Review/Addendum Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 10 Baseline disease characteristics of the subjects in trial GS-US-334-0133 are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>. Overall, 58% were treatment-experienced and 42% were treatment-naïve. Approximately 21% of the subjects had cirrhosis at baseline, and 68% had non-CC IL28B. The majority of subjects (73%) had baseline viral load ≥ 6 log 10 IU/mL.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Results</head><p>A total of 73 genotype 2 subjects received treatment in the SOF+RBV 12 Week group and 250 genotype 3 subjects received treatment in the SOF+RBV 24</p><p>Clinical Review/Addendum Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671</p><p>12</p><p>Week group, including approximately 21% (68/323) with compensated cirrhosis in these two groups.</p><p>The overall SVR12 rate for genotype 2 subjects was 93%, with treatment-naïve subjects achieving an SVR12 rate of 97% and treatment-experienced subjects an SVR12 rate of 90% <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 5</ref>). The observed high SVR rates in genotype 2 subjects in this trial are consistent with those observed in other three Phase 3 trials (P7977-1231, GS-US-334-0107, GS-US-334-0108) which evaluated subjects with genotype 2 HCV who received 12 weeks of SOF+RBV treatment.</p><p>The overall SVR12 rate for genotype 3 subjects was 84%, with treatment-naïve subjects achieving an SVR12 rate of 93% and treatment-experienced subjects an SVR12 rate of 77% <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 5</ref>). Extending the treatment duration to 24 weeks in genotype 3 subjects resulted in improved SVR rates compared to shorter treatment durations (i.e., 12 or 16 weeks) evaluated in previous trials (P7977-1231, GS-US-334-0107, GS-US-334-0108). The overall relapse rate in GT2 subjects was 7%, with relapse rates of 3% and 10% in treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced subjects, respectively. GT3 relapse rates were 14% overall, and 5% and 20% in treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced subjects, respectively.  Extending the SOF+RBV treatment duration to 24 weeks in GT3 subjects improved SVR12 rates primarily by decreasing relapse. This point is further illustrated in the bar graph shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>. In treatment-naïve genotype 3 subjects, the SVR12 rate was 56% and relapse rate was 40% with 12 weeks of SOF+RBV treatment. Extending the treatment duration to 24 weeks improved the SVR12 rates to 93% and decreased the relapse rates to 5%.</p><p>In treatment-experienced genotype 3 subjects, SVR12 rate with 12 weeks of therapy was 30% and relapse rate was 66%. Increasing the duration to 16 weeks resulted in SVR rate of 62% and relapse rate of 38% which was still very high. In the VALENCE trial, treatment duration was 24 weeks which resulted in SVR rate of 77% and relapse rate of 20%.</p><p>In conclusion, by extending the treatment duration from 12 weeks to 24 weeks in treatment-experienced genotype 3 subjects, relapse rate decreased from 66% to 20%.</p><p>The SVR12 rates for selected subgroups in genotype 3 subjects receiving 24 weeks of SOF+RBV are shown in </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comments</head><p>Based on the available data from the ongoing VALENCE trial, sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin for 24 weeks is recommended for all genotype 3 patients.</p><p>The following treatment recommendations can be made:</p><p>• SOF+RBV 12 Week Treatment Regimen is recommended for chronic hepatitis C patients with genotype 2 HCV infection</p><p>• SOF+RBV 24 Week Treatment Regimen is recommended for chronic hepatitis C patients with genotype 3 HCV infection</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GS-US-334-0123 (PHOTON-1)</head><p>An estimated 4 to 5 million people worldwide are coinfected with HCV/HIV. About 25% of individuals infected with HIV in the US are also infected with HCV (http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/factsheets/hepatitis.htm accessed <ref type="bibr">May 14, 2013)</ref>. HCV/HIV coinfection leads to increased rates of liver fibrosis progression and hepatic decompensation. As HIV-related morbidity and mortality has decreased due to use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), liverrelated complications associated with HCV infection have become a leading cause of non-AIDS-related deaths in the HCV/HIV-coinfected population. Hence, availability of effective and safe drugs with better tolerated side effect profile for this patient population remains a priority for the Division.</p><p>Clinical <ref type="bibr">Review/Addendum Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 16</ref> In the original NDA submission, the Applicant had provided interim efficacy and safety data for this trial which was limited and was considered insufficient to support a full indication in this population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trial Design</head><p>Study GS-US-334-0123 (PHOTON-1) is an ongoing Phase 3, open-label, multicenter trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SOF+RBV in subjects with genotype 1, 2, or 3 HCV infection and HIV, type 1 (HIV-1) coinfection.</p><p>Primary objectives of this study are as follows:</p><p>• To determine the efficacy of treatment with SOF+RBV by the proportion of subjects with sustained viral response 12 weeks after discontinuation of therapy (SVR12)</p><p>• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SOF+RBV as assessed by review of the accumulated safety data, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA and CD4 T-lymphocyte percent Trial design is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. As of the data collection date, treatment-naive genotype 1, 2, and 3 HCV-infected subjects completed posttreatment follow-up through the primary endpoint of SVR12 or prematurely discontinued the trial. Of the 41 treatment-experienced genotype 2 or 3 HCV-infected subjects enrolled, 28 have completed posttreatment follow-up through posttreatment Week 12 or prematurely discontinued the trial. These subjects were included in the efficacy analysis (full analysis set), whereas all 41 subjects were included in the safety analysis (safety analysis set). <ref type="table" target="#tab_67">Table 7</ref> displays subject disposition in Study GS-US-334-0123. Approximately 10% of subjects discontinued the study drug in the two groups for the treatmentnaïve subjects, i.e., Group 1 (SOF+RBV 12 Weeks) in HCV genotype 2 or 3 treatment-naïve subjects and Group 3 (SOF+RBV 24 Weeks) in HCV genotype 1 treatment-naïve subjects. The most common reason for discontinuation in the two groups was adverse event (3-4%). For Group 2 (SOF+RBV 24 Weeks) in HCV genotype 2 or 3 treatment-experienced subjects, only one subject discontinued the study treatment.

The SVR12 rate was lower in HCV genotype 3 treatment-naïve subjects as compared to HCV genotype 2 treatmentnaïve subjects, i.e., 67% vs. 88%. The findings were consistent with what had been observed in Studies P7977-1231, GS-US-334-0107 and GS-US-334-0133 where SOF+RBV for 12 weeks was evaluated in treatment-naïve subjects monoinfected with genotype 2/3 HCV.</p><p>In Group 2 (SOF+RBV 24 Weeks) for HCV genotype 2 or 3 treatmentexperienced subjects, only two-thirds of the subjects (N=28) had their SVR12 data available in this submission including 15 HCV genotype 2 and 13 HCV genotype 3 subjects. The overall SVR12 rate was 93% for the 28 subjects. Although the sample size for each genotype was small, the SVR12 rate in the 15 genotype 2 subjects was 93% which was comparable to the rate seen in Study GS-US-334-0133 in which GT 2 treatment-experienced subjects received 12 weeks of SOF+RBV. The SVR12 rate for the 13 genotype 3 subjects was 92% which was numerically larger than the 77% SVR12 rate in the treatmentexperienced subjects mono-infected with genotype 3 HCV in Study GS-US-334- In Group 3 (SOF+RBV 24 Weeks) for HCV genotype 1 treatment-naïve subjects, the overall SVR12 rate was 76%. A total of 90 (79%) subjects in Group 1 had HCV genotype 1a HCV and 24 (21%) subjects had HCV genotype 1b infection. The SVR12 rates were 82% in HCV genotype 1a subjects and 54% in HCV genotype 1b subjects. The above noted difference in SVR rates between GT1a vs. GT1b subjects was more compared to that in Study GS-US-334-0110 where the 12-week SOF+PEG+RBV was evaluated in the HCV genotype 1 monoinfected subjects. The observed SVR12 rates in genotype 1a subjects was 10% higher than genotype 1b subjects in Study GS-US-334-0110.</p><p>Relapse accounted for all virologic failures across the groups except for two subjects (one in Group 1 and one in Group 3).</p><p>-One subject with genotype 2 infection experienced on-treatment virologic failure likely due to study drug non-adherence as assessed by serum sofosbuvir levels, hematologic parameters (as a surrogate for ribavirin use), and investigator report. -The other subject with genotype 1 infection experienced on-treatment virologic failure with hematologic parameters suggestive of inconsistent RBV adherence; sofosbuvir pharmacokinetic data are pending.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref> displays virologic responses at EOT and posttreatment visits. Almost all subjects had HCV RNA below LLOQ at the end of treatment regardless of different HCV genotypes and prior PEG+RBV treatment experience. However, the SVR rates varied based on genotype and prior PEG+RBV treatment experience. The relapses attributed to the decrease in the response rates from the EOT to posttreatment visits. The relapse rate at Week 12 posttreatment in GT3 TN subjects who received 12 weeks of SOF+RBV was 29%. These higher relapse rates further support conclusions from prior Phase 3 trials that 12 weeks of SOF+RBV is suboptimal for genotype 3 subjects. The relapse rate at Week 12 posttreatment in GT1b TN subjects who received 24 weeks of SOF+RBV was higher (42%) compared to GT1a TN subjects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comments</head><p>Based upon these interim efficacy results, SVR12 rates in genotype 2 and 3 appear comparable to the results observed in the HCV mono-infected population with 12 weeks and 24 weeks of treatment. These results in genotype 2 and 3 subjects suggest that treatment regimens for these genotypes can be similar to those in mono-infected patients.</p><p>The observed SVR12 results in genotype 1 subjects support an indication in HCV/HIV co-infected patients as well as HCV mono-infected patients who are interferon-ineligible and thus have no currently available treatment options. This therapeutic option for genotype 1 subjects is further discussed later.</p><p>Clinical Review/Addendum Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 25</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Grade 3 or 4 Adverse Events</head><p>Most AEs were reported as Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity. Anemia and fatigue were the only Grade 3 events that occurred in more than 1 subject in the active 27 treatment groups, occurring in 3 (1.3%) and 2 (0.9%) subjects, respectively as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 14</ref>. Hospital records indicate the subject was experiencing substantial family and workrelated social stressors as well as worsened insomnia in the days preceding the suicide attempt. The AE was considered resolved on posttreatment Day 6.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comment</head><p>As noted in Primary Clinical Review, the incidence of adverse events of completed suicide, suicidal ideation or suicide attempt in sofosbuvir trials is low and is mostly observed in subjects with pre-existing psychiatric conditions and/or accompanied by major life stressors.</p><p>The Applicant has now proposed a subsection titled "Less Common Adverse Reactions Reported in Clinical Trials (&lt;1%)" under Section 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS of the prescribing information, which includes adverse reactions that occurred in &lt;1% of subjects receiving sofosbuvir in a combination regimen in any one trial. The following events have been included:</p><p>Psychiatric Disorders: severe depression (particularly in subjects with preexisting history of psychiatric illness), including suicidal ideation and suicide.</p><p>The proposal seems reasonable and is acceptable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Common Adverse Events</head><p>The most frequently reported AEs occurring in greater than or equal to 10% of subjects in any treatment group is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 15</ref>.  The incidence of pruritus, asthenia, insomnia, dry skin, dyspnea, and cough were similar in the SOF+RBV 12 Week and SOF+RBV 24 Week treatment groups. The Applicant noted that the increased incidence of the preferred term "asthenia" reported in Study GS-US-334-0133 as compared to the other Phase 3 trials of SOF+RBV is likely due to the regional differences in the description and reporting of AEs. In the largely US-based Phase 3 trials, P7977-1231, GS-US-334-0107 and GS-US-334-0108, fatigue was reported at a higher incidence than in Study GS-US-334-0133. The combined incidence of fatigue and asthenia is similar when comparing GS-US-334-0133 to the other trials. Diarrhea and irritability were approximately twice as frequent in the SOF+RBV 24 week treatment group compared with the SOF+RBV 12 Week treatment group. Nausea was more commonly reported with SOF+RBV for 12 weeks (31%) compared with either placebo treatment (11%) or SOF+RBV 24 weeks (13%).</p></div>

Subject was a 51 year old female with a family history of Wolff Parkinson White disease and a medical history relevant for palpitations. On Day 37 of SOF + RBV treatment, the subject experienced a "feeling of lump in throat, awareness of heart beat that was out of rhythm, breathlessness, cough and inability to sleep". These symptoms were identical to episodes she had experienced in the past, prior to study participation. She was admitted to the hospital. Her vital signs were stable (per investigator report) and ECG demonstrated ventricular ectopics. She was started on bisoprolol (5mg qd) and zoplicone (7.5mg qpm) and discharged the following day. While in the hospital, she missed one dose of RBV but otherwise study drugs were not interrupted or altered. She completed 24 weeks of treatment per protocol and achieved SVR12. The investigator assessed the event as not related to study drugs.</p><p>Grade 1 palpitations was the most common cardiac AE, occurring in 1% of placebo subjects, 1% of SOF + RBV 12 Week subjects, and 2% of SOF + RBV 24 Week subjects <ref type="table" target="#tab_23">(Table 17)</ref>.

According to the patient, he had an arrhythmia that required no treatment or additional follow up. On physical exam he was noted to have "extra beats" with normal vital signs (heart rate 80 beats per minute). The symptoms, though recorded as ongoing at the time of the data cut, were reported as resolved on post-treatment Day 8.</p><p>There were no Grade 3 cardiac AEs in either of the treatment arms.

Laboratory results were assigned toxicity grades (Grade 0, Grade  Elevated total bilirubin was the most frequent Grade 3 (20 subjects, 9.0%) and Grade 4 (12 subjects, 5.4%) laboratory abnormality. These elevations occurred mostly (30 of 32 subjects, 93.8%) in subjects receiving atazanavir (ATV) as part of the ARV regimen and were consistent with RBV-induced hemolysis in the setting of UGT1A1 inhibition by ATV.</p><p>As noted by the Applicant, none of the elevations in total bilirubin were associated with elevations in direct bilirubin or transaminitis. Consistent with RBV-induced hemolysis, total bilirubin elevations peaked at Week 1 or 2 with subsequent decreases observed thereafter. All subjects had improvement in total bilirubin to near baseline by the posttreatment Week 12 visit.</p><p>Among subjects not taking ATV, Grade 3 or 4 elevated total bilirubin was observed in 2 subjects (1.5%) which is similar to the rate (2.0%) observed with HCV-monoinfected subjects receiving SOF+RBV in registrational Phase 3 studies included in the Primary Safety Population of the original NDA submission. Reviewer's Comments Information regarding increased incidence of elevated total bilirubin levels in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects receiving concomitant atazanavir should be included in the prescribing information.</p><p>Grade 3 lipase elevations were the only other Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities to occur in more than 1 subject, occurring in 3 subjects in the SOF+RBV 24 Week TN GT 1 group.</p><p>-Two of the subjects had asymptomatic elevations of lipase (one subject at Week 12 and one subject at Week 20). -The third subject (#1961-8812) had Grade 1 or 2 lipase elevations at each on-treatment study visit and had Grade 3 lipase elevation (346 U/L) at Week 8. This was reported as a Grade 1 AE of pancreatitis by the investigator and was considered related to study drug. Additional information was subsequently requested and the investigator noted that the subject was asymptomatic with respect to findings suggestive of pancreatitis. The only other concomitant AE was "pain secondary to tooth extraction". The subject completed scheduled dosing without interruption and lipase values returned to within the reference range by posttreatment Week 4. The incidental finding of elevated lipase was reconsidered as clinically insignificant and has been removed from the database as an AE by the investigator.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIV-1 Viral Load at Baseline and End of Treatment</head><p>The majority of the subjects in the study had HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at baseline. Almost all the subjects with baseline HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL were on HIV antiretroviral therapy (ARV). The snapshot algorithm was applied by Dr. Karen Qi to calculate the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL at EOT. The algorithm is usually used to compute the primary efficacy endpoint of percent of subjects with HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL in the HIV trials. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 25</ref> shows the HIV viral load at EOT by the baseline viral load (&lt; 50 or ≥ 50 copies/mL). In all three treatment groups, above 90% of the subjects who had Clinical Review/Addendum Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671</p><p>42 baseline viral load below 50 copies/mL maintained their viral load suppressed &lt;50 copies/mL at EOT. It should be noted that the nine subjects classified as "virologic failure" include two subjects with confirmed rebound (see HIV Virologic Rebound), one subject not receiving ARV and six subjects with sporadic, isolated virologic blips. Review team believes that these six subjects did not have treatment failure of their HIV regimen due to SOF-based treatment. Instead, they had "blips" which can be seen in patients on stable ART. These isolated blips are not thought to Clinical Review/Addendum Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 43 necessarily predict virologic failure. As stated in the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents, "isolated blips (viral loads transiently detectable at low levels, typically &lt;400 copies/mL) are not uncommon in successfully treated patients and are not thought to represent viral replication or to predict virologic failure." 1</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIV-1 Virologic Rebound</head><p>According to the protocol, the subjects who met the following criteria were considered to have HIV-1 virologic rebound:</p><p>• at any visit, having at least two consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL (at least two weeks apart) • currently on ARV treatment and had HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL Only two subjects met the virologic rebound criteria (Subject # 4262-8725 in Group 1 and Subject # 0843-8852 in Group 3) during SOF+RBV therapy.</p><p>One subject in the HCV GT 2/3 treatment-naïve SOF+RBV 12 Week group on raltegravir plus tenofovir/emtricitabine had detectable HIV-1 RNA at Week 12. Poor adherence to both antiretroviral and study drug medication was suspected by the investigator, and this subject also experienced HCV relapse. One subject in the HCV GT 1 SOF+RBV 24 Week group on atazanavir/ritonavir plus tenofovir/emtricitabine had HIV-1 RNA ranging between &lt;20 to 75 copies/mL ontreatment, and 491 and 32 copies/mL at the posttreatment Week 4 and 12 visits, respectively. Poor adherence with antiretroviral treatment was reported by the investigator.</p><p>Subject #1692-8915 in Group 2 had HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at baseline, but had ≥ 50 copies/mL at Weeks 20 and 24 visits.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Summary</head><p>The observed safety profile of sofosbuvir and ribavirin (SOF+RBV) regimens is consistent with the previously noted adverse event profile in Primary Clinical Review based on the evaluation of data submitted at the time of original NDA. In addition, no new adverse events were identified. No clustering of adverse events and no trends in any specific adverse event type were noted.</p><p>In conclusion, based on the review of the additional data submitted, no major safety issues associated with sofosbuvir use have been identified to date. The noted safety profile of sofosbuvir is acceptable. A comprehensive assessment of the collective evidence to support a 24 week SOF+RBV regimen as an alternative therapeutic option for genotype 1 subjects who are ineligible to receive an IFN-based therapy was done.</p><p>The primary clinical data supporting the use of SOF+RBV for 24 weeks for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection is derived from Study GS-US-334-0123 (PHOTON-1) which is an ongoing Phase 3 trial evaluating SOF+RBV for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1-3 in HIV-infected subjects, including subjects with compensated cirrhosis with treatment durations of 12 or 24 weeks, depending on HCV genotype and treatment history.</p><p>As described earlier, in PHOTON-1, SOF+RBV regimen was studied for 24 weeks in 114 HCV genotype 1 treatment-naïve subjects co-infected with HIV-1. Out of these 114 subjects, 76% (87 subjects) have achieved SVR12 <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">(Table 10)</ref>. Relapse accounted for all HCV genotype 1 virologic failures except for one subject who experienced on-treatment virologic failure with hematologic parameters suggestive of inconsistent RBV adherence. The number of GT1 subjects with cirrhosis in this trial was small (n=5) and the observed SVR12 was 60% (3/5) based on these limited number of subjects. A substantial difference in SVR12 results was noted between GT1a vs. GT1b subjects (82% vs. 54% respectively) as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 10</ref>. The small number of subjects in these subgroups should be noted.</p><p>As noted by the Applicant, Phase 2 data from the NIAID-sponsored trial (11-I-0258) and the re-treatment arm of Study P2938-0721 (QUANTUM) further support the results obtained in PHOTON-1 with SVR12 response rates of 68% and 66% in genotype 1 HCV-infected patients who are not co-infected with HIV, and who were treated with SOF+RBV for 24 weeks, respectively. The data from NIAID-sponsored trial (11-I-0258) and the re-treatment arm of Study P2938-0721 (QUANTUM) have not been independently reviewed.</p><p>These Phase 2 and 3 data collectively demonstrate HCV genotype 1 treatmentnaïve SVR rates between 66 and 76% following SOF+RBV for 24 weeks, which is similar to the current HCV genotype 1 standard of care of a PI (boceprevir or telaprevir) plus PEG/RBV with SVR rates between 66% and 75%, after 24-48 weeks of therapy. SOF+RBV offers an all oral, interferon-free, low pill burden option to HCV genotype 1 patients who may be unable to take interferon. Exploratory analyses were performed by the review team and were presented at the Advisory Committee meeting in a collaborative presentation from Drs. Karen Qi and Jeffry Florian. Please refer to their respective reviews for details of the analyses performed.</p><p>One of the exploratory analyses performed predicted the SVR rate based on the observed SVR rate for PEG/RBV treatment in the historical trials, which ranges from 40% to 50%. As a conservative assessment, it was assumed that 50% of the HCV genotype 1 treatment-naïve subjects in NEUTRINO could be PEG/RBV treatment failures and that all 11% of subjects who failed to respond SOF+PEG+RBV in NEUTRINO can also be classified as PEG/RBV treatment failures. This implied that 39% (i.e., 50% -11%) of the potential PEG/RBV treatment failures responded to the SOF+PEG+RBV treatment. Thus, based on these assumptions, the predicted SVR rate in HCV genotype 1 treatmentexperienced population is 78% (i.e., 39/50).</p><p>Another analysis was done using selected baseline factors which are known to be associated with lower response to PEG/RBV therapy. These baseline factors were: IL28B non-CC genotype, baseline HCV RNA viral load &gt;800,000 IU/mL and METAVIR score of F3-F4. Using NEUTRINO data, subjects with all three of these baseline factors had an observed SVR12 rate of 71%, with a 95% confidence interval of 57-83% ( <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). Acknowledging the lack of clinical data directly obtained in the HCV GT1 patients who have failed a prior PEG/RBV regimen, the review team believes that the SOF+PEG+RBV shorter treatment duration and improved tolerability profile can provide a therapeutic option for this patient population.</p><p>Please refer to AC transcripts for detailed discussion by the committee members on the FDA analyses and the proposed treatment regimen.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Recommendation on Regulatory Action</head><p>From a clinical reviewer's perspective, the approval of sofosbuvir is recommended for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection in adults. This recommendation is based on the review of the data presented in the marketing new drug application <ref type="bibr">(NDA 204671)</ref>. The efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir was demonstrated in the four pivotal Phase 3 trials (P7977-1231, GS-US-334-0107, GS-US-334-0108, and GS-US-334-0110). The currently available data supports a favorable risk benefit assessment for the use of sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin in treatment-naïve and treatmentexperienced subjects with genotype 2 or 3 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and sofosbuvir in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin in treatment-naïve subjects with genotype 1 or 4 HCV infection.</p><p>No deficiencies in the submitted/reviewed data preclude recommendation for approval of sofosbuvir at this time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Risk Benefit Assessment</head><p>The overall risk benefit assessment is markedly favorable for sofosbuvir. This assessment is based on the demonstrated efficacy results, observed safety profile, shorter treatment duration and simpler treatment regimens compared to currently available therapeutic regimens for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy</head><p>The efficacy of sofosbuvir in subjects with chronic HCV infection was established in four Phase 3 pivotal trials (P7977-1231, GS-US-334-0107, GS-US-334-0108, and GS-US-334-0110). The primary efficacy endpoint was sustained virologic response defined as HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ 12 weeks after the discontinuation of treatment or active therapy (SVR12). The overall efficacy results for each of the pivotal trials are briefly summarized below and details are further discussed in Section 6 (Review of Efficacy).</p><p>• The efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir and ribavirin (SOF+RBV) for 12 weeks compared with pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PEG+RBV) for 24 weeks was evaluated in treatment-naive subjects with genotype 2 or 3 HCV infection (Study P7977-1231). The overall SVR12 rate in the SOF+RBV group was 67%, which was noninferior to the SVR12 rate of 67% in the PEG+RBV group. The difference (95% CI) in proportions was 0.1% (-8% to 8%). The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference between groups (i.e., SOF+RBV − PEG+RBV) was greater than the prespecified noninferiority margin of -15%.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>10</head><p>• The efficacy and safety of SOF+RBV for 12 weeks versus placebo was evaluated in subjects with genotype 2 or 3 HCV infection who were interferon (IFN) intolerant, IFN ineligible, or unwilling to take IFN (Study GS-US-334-0107). A statistically significant proportion of subjects (p &lt;0.001) in the SOF+RBV group achieved SVR12 (78%) compared with placebo (0%).</p><p>• The efficacy and safety of SOF+RBV for 12 weeks or 16 weeks was evaluated in treatment-experienced subjects with genotype 2 or 3 HCV infection (Study GS-US-334-0108). The SVR12 rates in the SOF+RBV 12 Week group was 50% and in the SOF+RBV 16 Week group was 71%, which were each statistically significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) compared to the prespecified null rate of 25%.</p><p>• The efficacy and safety of a SOF+PEG+RBV treatment regimen for 12 weeks was evaluated in treatment-naïve subjects with genotype 1, 4, 5, or 6 HCV infection (Study GS-US-334-0110). A statistically significant higher proportion of subjects achieved SVR12 (90%, p &lt; 0.001) compared with an historical SVR12 rate of 60%. It should be noted that few subjects with genotype 5 (N=1) and genotype 6 (N=6) were included in the clinical trial and the available data are insufficient to make any definite dosing recommendations for patients with genotype 5 or 6.</p><p>In summary, two Phase 3 trials demonstrated efficacy in treatment-naive CHC subjects: Study GS-US-334-0110 demonstrated the efficacy of a SOF+PEG+RBV treatment regimen for 12 weeks in subjects with genotype 1 or 4 HCV infection and Study P7977-1231 demonstrated the efficacy of a SOF+RBV treatment regimen for 12 weeks in subjects with genotype 2 or 3 HCV infection; one Phase 3 trial (Study GS-US-334-0107) demonstrated the efficacy of a SOF+RBV-treatment regimen for 12 weeks in subjects with genotype 2 or 3 HCV infection who were IFN intolerant, IFN ineligible, or unwilling to take IFN thus addressing an unmet need for therapy in these patients, and one Phase 3 trial (Study GS-US-334-0108) demonstrated the efficacy of a SOF+RBV treatment regimen for 12 or 16 weeks in treatment-experienced subjects with genotype 2 or 3 HCV infection. All four Phase 3 trials included a subset of subjects with compensated cirrhosis which represents a harder to treat subgroup.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety</head><p>The safety evaluation focused on overall safety as well as adverse events of special interest. The data derived from the four pivotal Phase 3 trials (P7977-1231, GS-US-334-0107, GS-US-334-0108, and GS-US-334-0110) constitute the primary safety population. The data from Phase 1 trials, Phase 2 trials and other ongoing trials constitute the supporting safety data. The notable safety findings have been discussed in relevant sections throughout the review and the details are provided in Section 7 (Review of Safety). Safety data for the SOF+PEG+RBV regimen in subjects with genotype 1, 4, 5, and 6 HCV infection were evaluated from trial GS-US-334-0110. The three most common adverse events in subjects in the SOF+PEG+RBV group were: fatigue (59%), headache (36%), and nausea (34%).</p><p>An improved safety profile for all-oral SOF+RBV regimens was noted as compared to interferon based treatment regimens. Overall, the observed incidences of adverse events (any grade), Grade 3 or higher adverse events, and adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation, interruption or dose modification of the study drugs was lower in sofosbuvir-containing treatment regimens. The incidence of treatmentemergent adverse events reported as related to study drug (by investigator's causality assessment) was low. No clustering of adverse events and no trends in any specific adverse event type were noted.</p><p>Based on the review of available clinical data at this time, a detailed safety evaluation focusing on cardiac disorders revealed no potential safety concerns in regards to cardiac toxicity associated with sofosbuvir use. No renal adverse events of concern have been identified to date. Mild elevations of serum creatine kinase values were noted without any associated clinical symptoms of concern. Mild elevations of lipase values were noted which were not associated with clinical signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis. No obvious safety concern of gastrointestinal toxicity associated with sofosbuvir use was identified. Elevated bilirubin levels consistent with hemolytic anemia associated with ribavirin therapy were noted. No safety signals related to hepatotoxicity was identified in the sofosbuvir treated groups. No acute hypersensitivity reactions such as Stevens -Johnson Syndrome (SJS) or Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) were reported. No safety signals related to bone marrow suppression were identified in the sofosbuvir treated groups.</p><p>In conclusion, the observed safety profile of sofosbuvir and ribavirin (SOF+RBV) regimens is consistent with the known safety profile of ribavirin. The safety profile of pegylated interferon and ribavirin containing sofosbuvir regimen (SOF+PEG+RBV) is similar to the well documented adverse event profile of pegylated interferon and ribavirin containing treatment regimens. In addition, the known toxicities of ribavirin or expected Clinical Review Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 Sofosbuvir 12 side effects associated with pegylated interferon use do not seem to be exacerbated when used in combination with sofosbuvir. No major safety issues associated with sofosbuvir use have been identified to date.</p><p>Overall Risk Benefit Assessment Sofosbuvir and ribavirin combination regimen provides a first all-oral treatment option for chronic hepatitis C patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection. The SOF+RBV regimen offers a shorter duration of treatment with an improved safety profile compared to interferon based regimen. In addition, SOF+RBV regimen provides therapeutic option for patients who are ineligible, intolerant or non-willing to take interferon-based regimens, thus addressing an unmet need in this patient population.</p><p>Sofosbuvir in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin (SOF+PEG+RBV) provides improved efficacy and shorter duration of treatment for chronic hepatitis C patients with genotype 1 or 4 infection. The shorter duration of interferon and ribavirin based regimen translates into a better tolerated side effect profile which in turn leads to less treatment discontinuations and contributes to improved rates of sustained virologic response. The observed safety profile is consistent with the well-documented safety profile of interferon and ribavirin.</p><p>An advisory committee meeting has been scheduled on October 25, 2013 to discuss this application. The expert opinion and recommendations from the committee will be considered before the final regulatory decision is made regarding approval of sofosbuvir for treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Review</head><p>Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 Sofosbuvir 13 2 Introduction and Regulatory Background HCV is a small, enveloped, single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus of the family Flaviviridae. Globally, it is estimated that 170-200 million persons are infected with HCV, and it affects about 3-5 million people in the United States (US).</p><p>(http://www.epidemic.org/thefacts/theepidemic/worldPrevalence/) HCV infection is a major public health problem and a leading cause of chronic liver disease in the US. The natural history of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) involves progression to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver failure, and death. CHC is currently the most common reason for liver transplantation in the US. By 2007, there were more yearly deaths in the US related to HCV than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Ly 2012)</ref>. Without effective treatment interventions, significant increases in CHCassociated morbidity, mortality, and health care costs are predicted <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kim 2002)</ref>. The ultimate goal of CHC treatment is to reduce the occurrence of end-stage liver disease and its complications including decompensated cirrhosis, liver transplantation and hepatocellular carcinoma.</p><p>HCV is classified into different genotypes based on genetic (RNA sequence) variability. The most common genotype in the US (70-75%) is genotype 1 followed by genotype 2 and genotype 3. Genotype 4, 5, and 6 HCV infections are most prevalent in the Middle East, South Africa, and Southeast Asia, respectively.</p><p>The current application requests approval of sofosbuvir for the proposed indication for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in adults.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Product Information</head><p>Generic <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(</ref> No trade name for sofosbuvir has been approved at this time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Tables of Currently Available Treatments for Proposed Indications</head><p>The current standard of care treatment for chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection is the triple therapy with NS3/4A protease inhibitor in combination with pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin for a total duration of 24 to 48 weeks based on on-treatment response.</p><p>The current standard of care treatment for chronic hepatitis C genotype 2 and 3 infection is the combination therapy with pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin for a total duration of 24 weeks. The recommended treatment duration for genotype 4 HCV infection is the combination therapy with pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin for a total duration of 48 weeks. The currently approved drugs for the treatment of HCV infection are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_47">Table 1</ref>. The currently available therapeutic regimens have decreased the morbidity and mortality associated with HCV infection. However, the tolerability of these regimens is still a major issue. It is imperative that safe and effective treatment options are available to minimize the impact of this major public health problem. Therefore, the development of new therapeutic modalities that are more efficacious, are better tolerated with improved safety profiles, have less associated pill and injection burden and can be administered with simple treatment and management algorithms are much needed for the optimal management of patients chronically infected with HCV.</p></div>

Currently, no pharmacologically related products have received FDA approval and this is the first drug in the pharmacologic class of HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor filed for the marketing licensure in US.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Important Safety Issues With Consideration to Related Drugs</head><p>The development of an investigational agent labeled BMS-986094 (formerly known as INX-189), a nucleotide polymerase (NS5B) inhibitor in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of hepatitis C was halted by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company in August, 2012 after nine patients in a clinical trial had to be hospitalized and one of them died of heart failure. In a Press Release dated August 23, 2012, Bristol-Myers Squibb stated that "While the cause of these unexpected events, which involve heart and kidney toxicity, has not been definitively established, the Company has determined that it is in the best interest of patients to halt development of BMS-986094." (http://www.bms.com/News/press releases/Pages/default.aspx)</p><p>Although sofosbuvir is structurally different (GS-7977 is a 2'-F, 2'-Me uridine monophosphate analogue prodrug and BMS-986094 is a 2'-Me guanosine monophosphate analogue prodrug), a detailed safety evaluation focused on cardiac disorders was done to identify any potential safety signal. No safety issues related to cardiac toxicity have been noted in clinical development program of sofosbuvir to date. Please see Section 7.2.6 for full assessment.</p><p>The proposed indication for sofosbuvir use is in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin or with ribavirin (based on genotype); hence the safety profile of these drugs is discussed briefly in this section.</p><p>Almost all patients treated with pegylated interferons and ribavirin experience one or more adverse events during the course of therapy. The most commonly reported adverse events are influenza-like side effects such as fatigue, headache, myalgia, fever and rigors. Other common adverse events are anorexia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, arthralgias, injection site reactions, alopecia, and pruritus. Neuropsychiatric side effects include depression, anxiety, insomnia, emotional lability, mood disorders, frank psychosis, suicidal ideation, actual suicide, and homicide. Adverse events are a major reason that patients decline or stop HCV therapy altogether. The currently approved alpha-interferon product labels carry Warnings and Precautions regarding potential toxicities in a substantial number of organ systems. All the approved interferon products carry a Pregnancy Category rating of C.</p><p>The most common and concerning adverse events related to ribavirin are hemolytic anemia and rash. The hemolytic anemia associated with ribavirin therapy may result in worsening of cardiac disease and lead to fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions.</p><p>Ribavirin is genotoxic and teratogenic and is classified as Pregnancy Category X. The clinical protocols and the development plan were reviewed by the Division of Antiviral Products (DAVP) throughout the clinical development program and feedback was provided addressing the issues involving dose, durations, and optimization of treatment regimens.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Summary of Presubmission Regulatory Activity Related to Submission</head><p>Two End-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meetings were held with DAVP. Agreements were reached on the study design of pivotal trials in different patient populations to support the New Drug Application (NDA) for sofosbuvir (Pharmasset EOP2 meeting held August 18, 2011 and Gilead EOP2 meeting held on June 05, 2012).</p><p>A Type C Meeting (teleconference) was held on October 17, 2012 to discuss the strategy related to the format and content of the sofosbuvir NDA. The following excerpts from the official meeting minutes are included below to highlight one of the key agreements reached as the result of this meeting which is relevant to the current submission:</p><p>Sponsor's Question: Does the Agency agree that the data available in treatment-naïve genotype 2 and 3 HIV/HCV co-infected subjects at the time of the NDA filing supports the proposed indication?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FDA Response:</head><p>At this time, SVR4 data are not sufficient to support an indication in HIV/HCV treatment-naive genotype 2 and 3 subjects; however, we do expect these data to be submitted with the initial NDA. SVR12 data are needed to support an indication. Fewer than 300 HIV/HCV subjects may be acceptable for a future indication in the setting of favorable safety and efficacy data, and we encourage further discussion with the Division to reach agreement on the details of such a proposal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion at the Meeting:</head><p>Gilead stated they no longer plan for an HIV/HCV treatment-naïve genotype 2 and 3 indication with the original NDA submission; however, the submission would include SVR4 data for 31 HIV/HCV treatment-naïve genotype 2 and 3 subjects enrolled through the end of September 2012. Gilead had difficulty getting the expected enrollment for the genotype 2/3 co-infected population as agreed upon at the End-of-Phase 2 meeting held in June 2012. Logistical issues related to biopsies were the biggest contributor to the delay, because HIV physicians were not used to requesting this type of test.</p><p>Gilead expects to submit a supplemental NDA to support the HIV/HCV coinfection indication following the approval of the original NDA.</p><p>Pre-NDA Meeting: A Pre-NDA meeting was held on March 14, 2013 to seek agreement on key aspects related to the content and format of the application, to seek agreement on key phase 3 data and to discuss the proposed indication for sofosbuvir, specifically for genotype 3 subjects. The key outcomes of this meeting pertaining to current submission are noted below:</p><p>• Gilead presented summary data supporting 12-week treatment duration for genotype 2 treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced HCV-infected patients.</p><p>Their rationale for the 12-week duration is based on the high response rates in genotype 2 across multiple trials, overlapping confidence intervals, and small numbers in subgroups such as cirrhosis which therefore affect the differences observed. Gilead stated that they were cautious about over-interpreting results given the small numbers across the subgroups. Therefore, Gilead has no plans to change the 12 week treatment duration for all genotype 2 patients in the proposed label.</p><p>• Gilead agreed with the Agency's recommendation that longer treatment duration (16 weeks) would be more beneficial for all genotype 3 treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced HCV-infected patients.</p><p>• Gilead referenced discussion with European Medicines Agency (EMA), and their view that the label would be similar to HIV drug labels with broader indication statements. The Agency responded that this issue will also be a topic for discussion during the NDA review and the Advisory Committee meeting.</p><p>• Gilead is committed to doing an additional trial in HCV-infected subjects with severe renal impairment and will work with the Agency to design the trial.</p><p>• There will be no late submissions for this NDA submission.</p><p>• The sofosbuvir NDA will have an Advisory Committee Meeting.</p><p>• The meeting minutes from the October 17, 2012 Type C teleconference and the March 14, 2013 pre-NDA meeting will serve as an agreement between Gilead Sciences and the Agency (FDA/DAVP) as to what constitutes a complete NDA package for sofosbuvir.</p><p>The details of the milestone meetings can be found in the official meeting minutes archived in Document Archiving, Reporting &amp; Regulatory Tracking System (DARRTS).</p><p>All previous reviews can also be accessed in DARRTS for additional information.</p></div>

The Applicant certified that, as the sponsor of the submitted trials, the Applicant has not entered into any financial arrangement with the listed clinical investigators (list was included in the submission) whereby the value of compensation to the investigator could be affected by the outcome of the trial as defined in 21 CFR 54.2(a). The Applicant also certified that each listed clinical investigator required to disclose to the sponsor whether the investigator had a proprietary interest in this product or a significant equity in the sponsor as defined in 21 CFR 54.2(b) did not disclose any such interests. The Applicant further certified that no listed investigator was the recipient of significant payments of other sorts as defined in 21 CFR 54.2(f).</p><p>There are seven investigators listed who are participating or have participated in the clinical trials and who have financial interest or arrangements as described in 21 CFR 54.4(a)(3). Six of the investigators have significant payments of other sorts greater than $25,000 and one investigator disclosed equity interest greater than $50,000. The Form FDA 3455 for each investigator was provided.</p><p>Overall, the number of investigators with a financial interest is low. Moreover, due to the global multicenter nature of these trials, the potential bias by any one investigator is minimized. In addition, the efficacy endpoints are determined using objective measurements of HCV-RNA PCR by and hence will not be vulnerable to bias on the part of the investigator. Hence, the likelihood that trial results were biased based on financial interests is minimal.</p></div>

The S282T substitution was not cross-resistant with the NS5A inhibitor, GS-5885, or RBV. SOF remained fully active against all NS5B nucleoside and nonnucleoside inhibitor mutants, NS5A resistance mutants, and NS3 PI resistance associated mutants tested indicating that these mutants are not cross-resistant to sofosbuvir.</p><p>No S282T substitutions were identified at baseline or at time of relapse in any of the subjects from any of the Phase 3 trials in either the Gilead or FDA analyses.</p></div>

Key findings from Dr. Ellis's Review are provided below:</p><p>The nonclinical safety profile of sofosbuvir has been evaluated in: safety pharmacology studies in rats and dogs with GS-9851 (GS-9851 comprises 2 diastereomers, SOF and GS-491241, in an approximate 1:1 ratio); single-and repeat-dose toxicology studies in mice, rats and dogs with GS-9851 and/or sofosbuvir alone for up to 3, 6 and 9 months duration, respectively; up to 1-month repeat-dose toxicology studies with sofosbuvir to qualify impurities; fertility and pre-and post-natal developmental studies in rats and embryo-fetal developmental studies in rats and rabbits with sofosbuvir; and genetic toxicology studies (Ames, in vitro chromosomal aberration and in vivo mouse micronucleus assays) with GS-9851. In addition, numerous in vitro and in vivo nonclinical pharmacokinetic studies, evaluating the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of sofosbuvir, have been conducted.</p><p>Myocardial inflammation and degeneration occurred in rats administered oral GS-9851 doses of 2000 mg/kg/day (AUC last~2 06 μg.h/ml for GS-331007) in a 7-day toxicology study. The estimated AUC exposure for sofosbuvir-derived GS-331007 is ~14-fold that in humans at the recommended sofosbuvir dose, since GS-9851 consists of 50% sofosbuvir. Heart toxicity was not observed in rats administered oral doses of sofosbuvir up to 500 mg/kg/day (AUC last~6 6 μg.h/ml for GS-331007) for 6 months, or in dogs and mice administered sofosbuvir at up to 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day (AUC last~1 95 and 293 μg.h/ml for GS-331007), the highest doses examined in 9 and 3 month studies in dogs and mice, respectively, corresponding to AUC exposures ~9 (rat), 27 (dog) and 41 (mouse)-fold that in humans at the recommended sofosbuvir dose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Review</head><p>Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 Sofosbuvir 22 Gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage occurred in male dogs administered oral sofosbuvir doses of 500 mg/kg/day (AUC last~2 09 to 278 μg.h/ml for GS-331007 at 6 &amp; 3 months, respectively), corresponding to AUC exposures ~29 to 39-fold that in humans at the recommended sofosbuvir dose. Increased frequency and incidence of emesis and diarrhea also occurred at this dose level. These GI-related toxicities are most likely sofosbuvir-related; however, they also appear consistent with idiopathic hemorrhagic gastroenteritis of spontaneous origin. The NOEL for GI toxicity is 100 mg/kg/day (AUC last~9 0 μg.h/ml for GS-331007) in dogs administered oral doses of sofosbuvir for up to 9 months, corresponding to AUC exposure ~13-fold that in humans at the recommended sofosbuvir dose. GI hemorrhage has not been observed in rats or mice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Clinical Pharmacology</head><p>This section provides a brief summary of the clinical pharmacology of sofosbuvir. The Office of Clinical Pharmacology has determined that there is sufficient clinical pharmacology information provided in the NDA to support a recommendation of approval of sofosbuvir. Please refer to the Clinical Pharmacology Review by Dr. Jenny Zheng and Dr. Jeffry Florian for additional information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.1">Mechanism of Action</head><p>Sofosbuvir is an inhibitor of the HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is essential for viral replication. Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug of 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-2'-C-methyluridine monophosphate that undergoes intracellular metabolism to form the pharmacologically active uridine analog triphosphate (GS-461203), which can be incorporated into HCV RNA by HCV NS5B polymerase and acts as a chain terminator. In a biochemical assay, GS-461203 inhibited the polymerase activity of the recombinant NS5B from HCV genotypes 1b, 2a, 3a and 4a with IC50 values ranging from 0.7 to 2.6 µM. GS-461203 is not an inhibitor of human DNA and RNA polymerases or an inhibitor of mitochondrial RNA polymerase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.2">Pharmacodynamics</head><p>• In vitro studies indicated that sofosbuvir and its metabolites: • GS-331007 showed little or no inhibition of the renal transporters OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, and MATE1 (IC50 values &gt; 100 µM).</p><p>• Sofosbuvir and its metabolites GS-566500 and GS-331007 were minimally metabolized by FMO, UGT, or CYP. In human liver microsomes, CYP-and UGTrelated metabolism represents a minor contribution to SOF and GS-606965 (nucleotide analog monophosphate) disappearance.</p><p>Please refer to Clinical Pharmacology Review for detailed assessment of exposureresponse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.3">Pharmacokinetics</head><p>A comprehensive range of clinical trials was conducted to characterize the pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir and its predominant circulating metabolite GS-331007.</p><p>The results are summarized below:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Absorption</head><p>• Following oral administration of sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir was absorbed quickly and the peak plasma concentration was observed ~0.5-2 hours post-dose, regardless of dose level. Peak plasma concentration of GS-331007 was observed between 2 and 4 hours post-dose.</p><p>• Steady-state GS-331007 and sofosbuvir pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters after once-daily administration of sofosbuvir are similar between HCV-infected subjects and healthy subjects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of Food</head><p>• Relative to fasting conditions, the administration of a single dose of sofosbuvir with a standardized high fat meal slowed the rate of absorption of sofosbuvir but did not substantially affect the extent of absorption. The exposure of GS-331007 was not altered in the presence of a high-fat meal. Therefore, sofosbuvir can be administered without regard to food (as instructed in phase 3 trials).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distribution</head><p>• Sofosbuvir is approximately 61-65% bound to human plasma proteins and the binding is independent of drug concentration over the range of 1 μg/mL to 20 μg/mL. Protein binding of GS-331007 was minimal in human plasma. After a single 400 mg dose of [ 14 C]-SOF in healthy subjects, the blood to plasma ratio of 14 C-radioactivity was approximately 0.7.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Review</head><p>Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 Sofosbuvir</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>24</head><p>• Sofosbuvir is extensively metabolized in the liver to form the pharmacologically active, intracellular nucleoside analog triphosphate GS-461203. The metabolic activation pathway involves sequential hydrolysis of the carboxyl ester moiety catalyzed by human cathepsin A (CatA) or carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) and phosphoramidate cleavage by histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) followed by phosphorylation by the pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway. Dephosphorylation of the active metabolite results in the formation of the nucleoside metabolite GS-331007, which cannot be efficiently rephosphorylated and lacks anti-HCV activity in vitro.</p><p>• After a single 400 mg oral dose of [ 14 C]-SOF, 4%, 7.0% and 91% of the mean circulating plasma total radioactivity (24,979 ng eq·h/g) were accounted for by sofosbuvir, GS-566500 and GS-331007, respectively. These results indicate GS-331007 is the major circulating metabolite of sofosbuvir.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Elimination</head><p>• Following a single 400 mg oral dose of [ 14 C]-SOF, mean total recovery of the dose was greater than 92%, consisting of approximately 80%, 14%, and 2.5% recovered in urine, feces, and expired air, respectively. The majority of the sofosbuvir dose recovered in urine was GS-331007 (78%) while 3.5% was recovered as sofosbuvir. These data indicate that renal clearance is the major elimination pathway for GS-331007.</p><p>• The median terminal half-lives of sofosbuvir and GS-331007 were 0.4 and 27 hours, respectively. The primary safety population is represented by the integrated data from four Phase 3 trials (P7977-1231, GS-US-334-0107, GS-US-334-0108, and GS-US-334-0110).

Subjects received SOF or placebo on Days 0 to 27. Subjects also received treatment with PEG 180 µg weekly + RBV 1000 or 1200 mg (divided daily dose) starting on Day 0 of the trial which continued for 48 weeks. Subjects were followed for 24 weeks after the end of treatment to assess SVR at 12 and 24 weeks (SVR12 and SVR24).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Review</head><p>Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 Sofosbuvir 34 A total of 63 subjects received at least one dose of study drug: SOF 100 mg (16 subjects), SOF 200 mg (18 subjects), SOF 400 mg (15 subjects), or placebo (14 subjects) in combination with PEG+RBV. Of the 63 dosed subjects, 17 subjects did not complete 48 weeks of PEG+RBV treatment. Reasons for study discontinuation were generally similar and distributed across the four treatment groups. Overall, demographic and baseline characteristics were similar among the four treatment groups with no notable differences. Most subjects (82.5%) had baseline HCV RNA levels &gt; 800,000 IU/mL, genotype 1a infection (81%), and IL28B non-CC allele (73%). SVR12 and SVR24 rates were greatest in the SOF 200 mg+PEG+RBV (72% and 83%, respectively) and 400 mg+PEG+RBV (87% and 80%, respectively) groups versus the SOF 100 mg+PEG+RBV (56% and 56%, respectively) and placebo+PEG+RBV groups (50% and 43%, respectively).</p><p>No viral breakthrough was observed in any subject in any of the SOF dose groups through the 28 days of SOF dosing. Eight subjects (6 SOF+PEG+RBV subjects and 2 placebo+PEG+RBV subjects) had viral breakthrough during the PEG+RBV treatment period. For the 6 SOF+PEG+RBV subjects, breakthrough occurred relatively soon after discontinuing SOF (at Week 6 or 8). Ten subjects (7 SOF+PEG+RBV and 3 placebo+PEG+RBV subjects) relapsed during follow-up visits. Of the 7 relapsed SOF+PEG+RBV subjects, 5 received SOF 100 mg+PEG+RBV, 1 received SOF 200mg+PEG+RBV, and 1 received SOF 400 mg+PEG+RBV. No deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs), pregnancies, or discontinuations of study drug due to adverse events (AEs) were reported in the SOF treatment period of this trial. All AEs were reported as Grade 1 (mild) or 2 (moderate) in severity, and were consistent with the known safety profile of PEG+RBV.</p><p>As SVR12 and SVR24 rates were lowest, and breakthrough and relapse rates were highest, in the SOF 100 mg+PEG+RBV group, SOF 200 mg+PEG+RBV and 400 mg+PEG+RBV were the therapeutic doses carried forward for further evaluation in Study P7977-0422 over a longer treatment duration.</p></div>

A total of 25 genotype 2 or 3 HCV-infected subjects were enrolled and received open-label SOF 400 mg in combination with PEG+RBV. Overall, the demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable between the four treatment groups. Most subjects (76%) had a baseline HCV RNA ≥ 800,000 IU/mL, had genotype 1a HCV infection (63%), and had IL28B non-CC allele. Most subjects (77%) had portal fibrosis based on the liver biopsy.

In genotype 1 HCV-infected subjects, virologic breakthroughs during treatment with PEG+RBV following treatment with SOF+PEG+RBV were more common in the SOF 200 mg+PEG+RBV group compared with the SOF 400 mg+PEG+RBV group, suggesting that the SOF 400 mg dose may provide greater suppression of viral activity.</p><p>Seven treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in five subjects in the SOF/placebo treatment period of this trial: retinal vein occlusion (SOF 200 mg+PEG+RBV), lymphangitis (SOF 400 mg+PEG+RBV), acute myocardial infarction (SOF 400 mg+PEG+RBV), depression and suicidal ideation (SOF 400 mg+PEG+RBV), and chest pain and ST segment elevation on ECG (placebo+PEG+RBV). Except for one SAE (lymphangitis) that was considered to be unrelated to all drugs, all of these SAEs were considered to be related to PEG, and/or RBV, but not SOF or placebo. No subjects in the genotype 2 or 3 SOF 400 mg+PEG+RBV group experienced an SAE. The retinal vein occlusion was the only treatment-emergent SAE that did not resolve. Seventeen treatment-emergent AEs leading to discontinuation of any drug were reported in 8 subjects. Three subjects, all in the SOF 400 mg+PEG+RBV group, had AEs leading to discontinuation of SOF: SAE of acute myocardial infarction (subject had an ongoing history of atypical chest pain, further discussed in Section 7.2.6), depression and suicidal ideation (SAEs, subject had a history of ongoing depression), and aphthous stomatitis. These four events were considered by the investigator to be unrelated to SOF or placebo, but related to PEG and/or RBV. There were no deaths reported in the trial and one subject (placebo+PEG+RBV group) had a confirmed ongoing pregnancy Clinical Review Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 Sofosbuvir 36 during the trial.

No subject relapsed between SVR12 and SVR24, showing the durability of SVR12.</p><p>Mean duration of exposure to study drug was 11.4 weeks for Group A; 21.3 weeks for Group B; and 23.1 weeks for Group C and showed that most subjects were exposed to study drug for planned duration of treatment for the treatment group (Group A = 12 weeks and Groups B/C = 24 weeks).The majority of subjects in all groups had at least one AE. Most AEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity, and were typical of the expected safety profile of PEG+RBV.</p><p>Grade 3 or higher AEs were reported by &lt; 18% of subjects in all treatment groups and the frequency was comparable among treatment groups. Grade 4 AEs were reported by Subject #1040-7223 in Group A (road traffic accident, SAE), Subject #1009-7421 in Group B (pyelonephritis, SAE) and by two subjects in Group C1 (#1033-7090 and #1008-7428; neutropenia). Besides neutropenia, fatigue was the only other Grade 3 AE that was reported in ≥3 subjects in any treatment group. The majority of Grade 3 AEs of neutropenia, fatigue, and anemia were considered related to at least PEG+RBV study drug. No Grade 3 AEs of neutropenia, fatigue, and anemia were considered related to sofosbuvir only.</p><p>Thirteen treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 12 subjects: two subjects (3.8%) in Group A, six subjects (4.8%) in Group B, and four subjects (2.6%) in Group C (two subjects each in both Groups C1 and C2). Nine SAEs were considered unrelated to study drug treatment (arrhythmia -details in Section 7.2.6, colitis ischemic, chest pain, cholecystitis acute, cholelithiasis, alcohol poisoning, road traffic accident, costochondritis, and hip arthroplasty). Four SAEs of anemia, autoimmune hepatitis (details in Section 7.4.2), pyelonephritis, and pancytopenia were reported as related to PEG+RBV study drug (but unrelated to sofosbuvir). Two SAEs (autoimmune hepatitis and chest pain) led to permanent discontinuation of study drug. No deaths were reported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study P7977-0523 (ELECTRON)</head><p>This Phase 2a, open-label trial evaluated different treatment regimens of SOF alone and in combination with RBV with and without PEG. This submission includes the data for Parts 1, 2, and 3 (Groups 1−9). In Part 1 (Groups 1−4) and 2 (Group 6) of this trial, the potential to achieve SVR following treatment with SOF 400 mg once daily + RBV 1000 or 1200 mg daily (divided dose) with shortened PEG therapy (180 µg weekly) or the absence of PEG was evaluated in noncirrhotic, treatment-naive subjects with Clinical Review Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 Sofosbuvir 38 genotype 2 or 3 HCV infection. In Part 2 (Group 5), SOF 400 mg once daily alone was evaluated in noncirrhotic, treatment-naive subjects with genotype 2 or 3 HCV infection. In Part 2 (Group 7), SOF 400 mg once daily + RBV 1000 or 1200 mg daily (divided dose) was evaluated in noncirrhotic subjects with genotype 1 HCV infection who demonstrated null response (defined as &lt; 2 log 10 IU/mL decrease from baseline in HCV RNA) following previous PEG+RBV therapy. For Part 3, two treatment groups were added to evaluate SOF 400 mg once daily + RBV 1000 or 1200 mg daily (divided dose) for 12 weeks in treatment-experienced subjects with genotype 2 or 3 HCV infection and treatment-naive subjects with genotype 1 HCV infection. In this trial, SOF 400 mg was administered orally once daily for 8 or 12 weeks, according to treatment group assignment. This trial was not designed to evaluate formal statistical hypotheses. All but one subject completed the trial as assigned by treatment group. One subject (Subject 1030-5047) discontinued PEG at Day 29 due to an AE of depression; but completed treatment with SOF+RBV for 12 weeks (Group 4). The event was considered probably related to PEG, unlikely related to SOF, and not related to RBV.</p><p>No deaths were reported. Three SAEs were reported: angina pectoris (Subject #1031-5070 -details in Section 7.2.6), urethral injury (Subject #1030-5137), and furuncle (Subject #1030-5039). Only urethral injury occurred during treatment in a treatmentnaive subject with genotype 1 HCV infection who received SOF+RBV for 12 weeks (Group 8). The two other SAEs occurred during follow-up. All SAEs were considered not related to SOF.</p><p>Hematology laboratory abnormalities were more common among subjects who received PEG than in subjects who did not receive PEG. For subjects who received SOF in combination with PEG+RBV (Groups 2−4 and 6), the most frequently reported Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities were decreased hemoglobin levels and neutrophil counts. No Grade 4 laboratory abnormality of decreased hemoglobin levels was reported. For subjects who received SOF alone and in combination with RBV (Groups 1, 5, and 7−9) one Grade 4 laboratory abnormality of decreased lymphocytes was reported in a subject receiving SOF monotherapy (Group 5). The most frequently reported Grade 3 hematology laboratory abnormality was decreased hemoglobin levels. Three Grade 3 chemistry laboratory abnormalities were reported in subjects receiving SOF alone or in combination with RBV: elevated creatine kinase, elevated ALT, and elevated total bilirubin. No AE was associated with these laboratory abnormalities.</p></div>

For this submission, only data for the SOF 400 mg + RBV treatment regimens (Groups C and G) through follow-up Week 12 are included. Following screening, 50 treatment-naive subjects with genotype 1, 2, or 3 HCV infection (genotype 1, 38 subjects and genotype 2 or 3, 12 subjects) were randomized to Groups C and G in Clinical Review Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 Sofosbuvir 39 equal ratios. Randomization was stratified by genotype (i.e., genotype 1a vs genotype 1b vs other), baseline HCV RNA (&lt; 6 log 10 or ≥ 6 log 10 IU/mL), and cirrhosis (present or absent). Three subjects had cirrhosis at screening: 1 of 25 subjects (4%) in Group C and 2 of 25 subjects (8%) in Group G. Subjects in Group C received SOF 400 mg once daily + RBV 1000 or 1200 mg (divided daily dose) for 12 weeks and subjects in Group G received SOF 400 mg once daily + RBV 1000 or 1200 mg (divided daily dose) for 24 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was SVR12.</p><p>Sofosbuvir 400 mg in combination with RBV given for 12 weeks was shown to be as effective as 24 weeks of treatment in achieving SVR in subjects with genotypes 1 through 3 HCV (56% versus 52%, respectively). Virologic relapse occurred in a similar proportion of subjects who received either 12 or 24 weeks of sofosbuvir+RBV treatment (i.e., 39% and 44%, respectively).</p><p>Similar safety profile was observed in the 12-and 24-week treatment groups. The majority of subjects in all groups had at least 1 AE and 1 laboratory abnormality, generally Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity, and comparable within the sofosbuvir+RBV groups. In the sofosbuvir+RBV groups the most frequent AEs (and AEs considered related to study drug) were fatigue, nausea, headache, and insomnia. In the 24-week sofosbuvir+RBV group, two of 25 subjects (8%) experienced four Grade 3 AEs. Two of these events (bronchitis and chest pain) were also considered SAEs and unrelated to study drug. No other Grade 3 or 4 AEs or SAEs were reported in the sofosbuvir+RBV groups. Adverse events that led to study drug discontinuation of sofosbuvir+RBV included decreased appetite (Grade 2, 1 subject) reported in the 12-week treatment group.</p></div>

The subjects were enrolled in approximately 1:3 ratio and were stratified by HCV genotype (2 or 3), screening HCV RNA levels (&lt; 6 log 10 IU/mL or ≥ 6 log 10 IU/mL), and cirrhosis (present or absent). Approximately 20% of the subjects enrolled had evidence of cirrhosis. Eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of following treatment groups:</p><p>• SOF+RBV: SOF 400 mg + RBV 1000 mg or 1200 mg (based on baseline body weight) daily for 12 weeks</p><p>• PEG+RBV: PEG 180 µg weekly + RBV 800 mg daily for 24 weeks A total of 527 subjects were randomized (263 subjects in SOF+RBV group; 264 subjects in PEG+RBV group). All randomized subjects were enrolled at 90 sites: 61 in the US (including 1 in Puerto Rico), 14 in Australia, 6 in New Zealand, 5 in Canada, 2 in Sweden, 1 in Italy, and 1 in the Netherlands. A total of 499 randomized subjects received treatment in this trial (256 subjects in the SOF+RBV group; 243 subjects in the PEG+RBV group).</p><p>Overall, the SOF+RBV treatment regimen seems to be better tolerated than the comparator PEG+RBV treatment regimen. The overall summary of adverse event profile in Study P7977-1231 is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref>.  There were a decreased number of treatment-emergent as well as treatment-related AEs observed in the SOF+RBV group compared to the PEG+RBV group (86% vs. 96% and 72% vs. 94% respectively). The frequency of Grade 3 and Grade 4 events, AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drugs, and AEs leading to modification or interruption of study drugs were also lower in SOF+RBV group compared to active control group <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 5)</ref>. Three subjects discontinued due to AEs in SOF+RBV group. MedDRA preferred terms were: decreased appetite, weight decreased, depression, abnormal dreams, agitation, apathy in one subject; increased CPK (n=1) and chest pain (n=1). The most frequently reported AEs leading to dose modification or interruption of study drug in SOF+RBV group were: anemia (16 subjects), decreased Hgb (3 subjects), and fatigue, nausea, dizziness, dyspnea, and myalgia (2 subjects each). Although the number of subjects with SAE was higher in the SOF+RBV group (n=7) compared to PEG+RBV group (n=3); only one SAE (anemia) was reported as treatment-related (RBV was interrupted). The causality assessments of the investigators seem reasonable. The observed SAEs are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref>.  The primary objectives of this trial as noted by the Applicant were the following:</p><p>• To determine the efficacy of treatment with GS-7977 + RBV compared to treatment with GS-7977 placebo + RBV placebo as measured by the rate of sustained viral response 12 weeks after discontinuation of therapy (SVR12) • To evaluate the safety and tolerability of GS-7977 + RBV compared to placebo control as assessed by review of the accumulated safety data</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Summary</head><p>Four Phase 3 pivotal trials evaluated the efficacy of sofosbuvir in subjects with chronic HCV infection.</p><p>• Study P7977-1231 evaluated the efficacy and safety of SOF+RBV for 12 weeks compared with PEG+RBV for 24 weeks in treatment-naive subjects with genotype 2 or 3 HCV infection. The primary efficacy endpoint was SVR12 and the prespecified non-inferiority margin was met. The overall SVR12 rate in the SOF+RBV group was 67%, which was noninferior to the SVR12 rate of 67% in the PEG+RBV group. The difference (95% CI) in proportions was 0.1% (-8% to 8%). The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference between groups (i.e., SOF+RBV − PEG+RBV) was greater than the prespecified noninferiority margin of -15%.</p></div>

All four Phase 3 trials included a subset of subjects with compensated cirrhosis which represents a harder to treat subgroup.</p><p>Sofosbuvir and ribavirin combination regimens provide a shorter, interferon-free, more convenient, all oral regimen option for chronic hepatitis C patients with genotype 2 and 3 infection. Sofosbuvir in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin provides a shorter 12 week regimen for chronic hepatitis C patients with genotype 1 and 4 infection. A shorter HCV treatment regimen translates into less pegylated interferon and ribavirin associated adverse events, less discontinuation and overall improved sustained virologic response rates. It should be noted that few subjects with genotype 5 (N=1) and genotype 6 (N=6) were included in the clinical trial and the available data are insufficient to make any definite dosing recommendations for patients with genotype 5 or 6.</p></div>

Evaluating clinical outcomes from prospective, randomized controlled clinical trials is challenging and not feasible because of the difficulty of maintaining patients on a randomized arm without intervening therapy for a sufficient duration (many years) to identify late-occurring clinical events such as HCC; therefore, treatment response is defined by virological parameters.</p><p>The most important virological parameter for treatment of chronic hepatitis C has been the sustained virological response (SVR), defined as the absence of HCV RNA from serum by a sensitive PCR assay 24 weeks following discontinuation of therapy. The attainment of SVR has been proven to be a reliable predictor of long-term clearance of hepatitis C infection and is generally regarded as a "virological cure".

Extending the treatment duration may potentially improve the overall efficacy results in the SOF+RBV treatment regimen. Moreover, high relapse rates observed in the subgroup of genotype 3 subjects further indicates that treatment duration needs to be optimized in this patient population.

These subjects were excluded from the primary efficacy Improved SVR rates for HCV GT3 subjects were noted with longer treatment duration in GS-US-334-0108, the only pivotal trial where different durations were explored. These data, combined with the approximately 40% relapse rate in the treatment-naïve trials, indicate that a longer treatment duration should be considered in all GT3 subjects. However, the SOF+RBV 16 Weeks treatment regimen was not evaluated in treatment naïve GT3 subjects in any of the pivotal Phase 3 trials submitted for review in this NDA. This poses a dilemma for a regulatory recommendation of 16 weeks of sofosbuvir and ribavirin therapy in all genotype 3 patients. Several bridging analyses were conducted by the Applicant and the FDA statistical review team to explore if this recommendation is reasonable or not. This is further discussed in Section 6.1.10.</p><p>Based on subgroup analyses from Study GS-US-334-0108, a numerical trend toward improved SVR12 rates with longer SOF/RBV duration (16 weeks) was observed in certain subgroups (e.g., cirrhosis, prior nonresponders) of genotype 2 subjects. We do acknowledge the small subgroup sample size; however, the improved efficacy outcome in this subgroup of patients with no potential additional safety risk due to tolerable safety profile warrants a longer duration of therapy in this population to maximize the outcome of therapy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Review</head><p>Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 Sofosbuvir 77 HCV genotype 1a treatment-naïve subjects had higher SVR12 rate than the genotype 1b subjects in GS-US-334-0110 (i.e., 92% vs. 82%). Historically, the subjects infected with genotype 1a HCV are harder-to-treat compared to the subjects with genotype 1b HCV infection. The Applicant attributed the observed treatment difference to the findings that the subjects with genotype 1a had a lower percentage of IL28B CC subjects, black subjects, non-cirrhotic subjects and had a lower mean age as compared to the subjects infected with genotype 1b HCV in the trial. However, the statistical reviewer compared the SVR12 rates between the two sub genotypes across the subgroups defined by the demographics and baseline characteristics, and found that the genotype 1a subjects had numerically higher SVR12 rate than the genotype 1b subjects in all subgroups. It should be noted that these analyses were post-hoc and the lack of a control group in this trial makes it challenging to derive any definitive conclusion whether the observed differences between the two sub genotypes were due to chance. The labeling implications of this observation are ongoing at this time.</p></div>

In the 12-week SOF+RBV group, 82% of the HCV genotype 2 subjects achieved SVR12 compared with 30% of the HCV genotype 3 subjects (p-value &lt; 0.0001 based on Chi-Square test). In the 16-week SOF+RBV group, the SVR12 rates were 89% and 62% for the genotypes 2 and 3 subjects, respectively (p-value = 0.0052 based on Chi-Square test).</p><p>The collective evidence from the three trials indicates that 12 weeks of SOF+RBV treatment regimen is not the optimal regimen for the genotype 3 patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response Rates based on Gender</head><p>The post-hoc analyses showed that the female subjects with genotype 3 infection had higher SVR12 rates than male subjects in all of the SOF+RBV treatment groups in the three pivotal trials (P7977-1231, GS-US-334-0107 and GS-US-334-0108) except for the SOF+RBV 12 Week treatment group in Study GS-US-334-0108 where the sample sizes were small. In addition, compared with the 24-week PEG+RBV group, the gender difference was more notable for the 12-week SOF+RBV in Study P7977-1231. These post-hoc exploratory analyses show that gender appears to affect the SVR rate for SOF+RBV among the HCV genotype 3 subjects. Additional subgroup analyses evaluating response rates based on documented response to prior course of HCV treatment were also evaluated by Statistical and Virology reviewers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.8">Analysis of Clinical Information Relevant to Dosing Recommendations</head><p>Study GS-US-334-0108 was the only pivotal trial which evaluated SOF+RBV 16 Weeks treatment duration. In Study GS-US-334-0108, treatment with SOF+RBV for 16 weeks resulted in higher SVR12 rates compared with the shorter treatment duration of 12 weeks. The difference in the percentage of subjects who achieved SVR12 between the 2 treatment groups (SOF+RBV 12 Week group − SOF+RBV 16 Week group) was −22% (95% CI: −35% to −9%) in favor of the SOF+RBV 16 Week group. This difference was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). However the relapse rate in the 16-week arm was still as high as 38% even though it was much lower than 66% in the 12-week arm. This suggested that the efficacy could potentially be further improved with longer treatment duration or additional of a third antiviral agent (PEG or DAA).</p><p>Exposure-response analyses were conducted by Dr. Florian for genotype 3 subjects based on the sparse pharmacokinetic data from GS-US-334-0108 (treatmentexperienced; SOF/RBV 12 weeks: n=64; SOF/RBV 16 weeks: n=63). These analyses Clinical Review Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 Sofosbuvir 80 demonstrated that increasing the treatment duration improved SVR12 from 45% to 78% in subjects with GS-331007 exposures greater than the median (7062 ng·hr/mL) though only marginal benefit was observed in subjects with GS-331007 exposures less than the median (7062 ng·hr/mL) (from 28 to 31%). Given the improvement in response observed by extending treatment to 16-weeks and the observation that all the treatment failures in both durations were relapsers, it is likely that extending the treatment duration in genotype 3 subjects even longer (e.g., 24 weeks) may result in further SVR12 improvements in this population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comments</head><p>The Phase 3 efficacy results show decreased response rates in genotype 3 subjects compared to genotype 2 subjects for a similar duration of therapy. Moreover, the reduced response rates in genotype 3 subjects seems to be driven by the high relapse rate which indicates that extending the duration of therapy may optimize the treatment regimen by potentially increasing the overall response rates.</p><p>6.1.9 Discussion of Persistence of Efficacy and/or Tolerance Effects</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SVR12 and SVR24 Concordance</head><p>Evaluation of SVR at 24 weeks (SVR24) post-treatment cessation has been the universally accepted time point to assess virologic response. With peg-IFN and RBV based therapy, viral relapse usually occurs in the first several weeks following treatment cessation and measurement of SVR at an earlier time point could yield greater trial efficiency. FDA reviewers examined whether SVR12 could be used as a primary efficacy endpoint by evaluating the correlation between SVR12 and SVR 24 in over 13,000 subjects pooled from multiple clinical trials of peg-IFN-based regimens. In brief, there was a high rate of concordance between SVR12 and SVR24. Sensitivity and specificity for SVR12 was 99% and 98%, respectively; therefore, SVR12 is now used as a primary endpoint for registrational trials.</p><p>In clinical trials of sofosbuvir, data is being collected for SVR24 in addition to SVR12 to further evaluate the persistence of treatment effects and concordance between SVR12 and SVR24 in non-IFN based regimens. Data from trials P7977-1231 and GS-US-334-0107 was evaluated by Dr. Florian. SVR24 data was unavailable from GS-US-334-0108 or GS-US-334-0110, so no concordance assessments could be performed for those two trials. Overall, assessments at week 12 of follow-up (SVR12) were concordant with those at week 24 of follow-up (SVR24). The positive predictive value based on data from the SOF+RBV treatment arm in P7977-1231 was 98.8% (161/163). The SOF+RBV treatment arm in GS-US-334-0107 showed 100% concordance between SVR12 and SVR24 in subjects with data available for both time points. The overall positive predictive value between SVR12 and SVR24 in SOF+RBV treatment arms was Clinical Review Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 Sofosbuvir 81 99.4% (314/316).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Review</head><p>Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 Sofosbuvir 82 SOF+RBV for 12 weeks is the only sofosbuvir regimen studied in treatment-naïve genotype 3 subjects in the pivotal Phase 3 trial (P7977-1231). However, GS-US-334-0108 demonstrated treatment-experienced genotype 3 subjects receiving SOF+RBV for 16 weeks had clinically significant increased SVR12 compared with the same regimen for 12 weeks. Therefore, the Applicant conducted a bridging analysis to estimate the SVR12 rate for 16 weeks of SOF+RBV in treatment-naïve genotype 3 subjects using the genotype 3 data in Studies P7977-1231 and GS-US-334-0108. Based on these results, the Applicant proposed a 16-week SOF+RBV regimen for all patients with genotype 3 infection.</p><p>Additional analyses were also done by the FDA Statistical Reviewer to determine whether the statistical methods in the Applicant's bridging analyses were appropriate. Also, in the statistical reviewer's opinion, instead of applying the model to estimate the SVR12 rate, the SVR12 rate could be extrapolated directly from the observed rates in Studies P7977-1231 and GS-US-334-0108 based on the assumption of the same odds ratios of 16-week SOF+RBV over 12-week SOF+RBV between treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced subjects. For details of statistical analyses please refer to FDA Statistics Review.</p><p>The statistical reviewer obtained an SVR12 rate of 83% for the 16-week SOF+RBV in treatment-naïve genotype 3 subjects based on the extrapolation which was very close to the Applicant's. The reviewer also used relative risk (RR) and proportion difference (PD) to extrapolate the SVR rate. The estimated SVR12 rate was 76% based on RR and 88% based on PD. All these post-hoc analyses suggested that the 16 weeks of SOF+RBV treatment in genotype 3 treatment-naïve subjects would lead to a higher SVR12 rate than 56% rate for the 12 weeks of SOF+RBV treatment seen in Study P7977-1231. From the statistical perspective, these bridging analyses were based on the assumptions (with no available clinical trial data to validate) and the lack of 16 week trial data makes it difficult to determine the optimal treatment duration for genotype 3 treatment-naïve patients.</p></div>

Given this previous observation, the high overall SVR rate identified in the Applicant's treatment-naïve trial (GS-US-334-0110), and analyses performed by the Pharmacometrics group (see Clinical Pharmacology Review), the currently available evidence supports the effectiveness of SOF+PEG+RBV regimen in genotype 1 PEG/RBV-nonresponders.</p><p>Data from GS-US-334-0110 suggests that subjects with detectable HCV RNA at Treatment Week 2 (TW 2) were less likely to achieve SVR12 compared to subjects with HCV RNA target not detected at TW 2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Summary</head><p>The observed safety profile of sofosbuvir and ribavirin (SOF+RBV) regimens is consistent with known safety profile of ribavirin. The safety profile of pegylated interferon and ribavirin containing sofosbuvir regimen (SOF+PEG+RBV) is similar to the well documented adverse event profile of pegylated interferon and ribavirin containing treatment regimens. In addition, the known toxicities of ribavirin or expected side effects associated with pegylated interferon use do not seem to worsen when used in combination with sofosbuvir. No clustering of adverse events and no trends in any specific adverse event type were noted.</p><p>• An improved safety profile for all-oral SOF+RBV regimens was noted as compared to interferon based treatment regimens. Overall, the observed incidences of adverse events (any grade), Grade 3 or higher adverse events, and adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation, interruption or dose modification of the study drugs was lower in SOF containing treatment regimens. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events reported as related to study drug (by investigator's causality assessment) was low.</p><p>• Based on the review of available clinical data at this time, a detailed safety evaluation focusing on cardiac disorders revealed no potential safety concerns in regards to cardiac toxicity associated with sofosbuvir use.</p></div>

The SOF+RBV regimen offers a shorter duration of treatment with improved safety profile compared to interferon based regimen. In addition, SOF+RBV regimen provides therapeutic option for patients who are ineligible, intolerant or non-willing to take interferon-based regimens, thus addressing an unmet need in this patient population.</p><p>Sofosbuvir in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin (SOF+PEG+RBV) provides improved efficacy and shorter duration of treatment for chronic hepatitis C patients with genotype 1 or 4 infection. The number of subjects with genotype 5 or 6 infection evaluated in pivotal trials is very small to make any conclusive decisions regarding dosing recommendations in this subpopulation. The shorter duration of interferon and ribavirin based regimen translates into a better tolerated side effect profile which in turn leads to less treatment discontinuations and contributes to improved rates of sustained virologic response. The observed safety profile is consistent with the well-documented safety profile of interferon and ribavirin. Some of the adverse events noted such as hepatocellular carcinoma or signs/symptoms of hepatic decompensation are consistent with the patient population under study and may be related to the underlying liver disease progression.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Review</head><p>Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 Sofosbuvir 97 Exposure-response safety analyses were also evaluated by Dr. Florian for adverse events of dyspnea and system organ class cardiac disorders (based on MEDRA system organ classification) to identify if the SOF or GS-331007 exposures from the Phase 3 trials were associated with any cardiac adverse events.</p><p>This analysis was based on the pooled Phase 3 population and identified that any grade dyspnea and any grade cardiac events were more likely in subjects with higher GS-331007 exposures. However, the significance of these adverse events relationships should be interpreted with caution. First, the overall number of cardiac events in the Phase 3 population administered SOF was 19 out of 991 subjects with PK data available (6 of 327 in SOF+PEG+RBV [1.8%] and 13 of 664 in SOF+RBV [1.9%]). This event rate was lower than the cardiac event rate observed in the PEG+RBV control arm from <ref type="bibr">P7977-1231 (11 of 243 [4.2%]</ref>). In addition, the adverse event listings under this system organ class were predominantly grade 1 (17 of 19; only two events were grade 2) and include palpitations, tachycardia, bradycardia, and ventricular extrasystoles. These adverse events could also be confounded by concomitant administration of ribavirin in all subjects treated in Phase 3 trials, which is known to cause hemolytic anemia. Some of the symptoms of anemia include fatigue, dyspnea, dizziness, headache, insomnia, tachycardia, and chest pain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comments</head><p>In most of the cases noted above, the subject either had a prior history of cardiovascular disease or had cardiovascular risk factors. No clustering of adverse events was noted. Ribavirin, which causes hemolytic anemia, can result in profound decreases in hemoglobin levels that can contribute to fatigue and possibly worsening of cardiac status.</p><p>Based on the review of submitted data to date, no obvious safety issue related to cardiac toxicity has been identified. We will continue to monitor closely in the postmarketing setting for any potential signals.</p></div>

Low potassium levels were detected and potassium supplement was started. The patient was released on the same date. Two days later, all study drugs were interrupted. The patient was hospitalized with a fever over 104 F. CT scan showed an early abscess on right lower quadrant. She was treated with Zosyn. The patient restarted the study drugs after 10 days of interruption and completed to final week 12 dose per protocol without any new adverse events. The outcome of the event was reported as resolved. The investigator assessed the event not related to the study medications or study procedures. Alternative This 34-year-old Caucasian male patient was treated with SOF+RBV for 12 weeks. Medical history was significant for eczema, asthma and gastric reflux. Concomitant medications included Seretide inhaler for asthma and Nexium for gastric reflux. Four weeks after treatment discontinuation, the patient was hospitalized for worsening eczema, swelling in both lower legs lower, and painful left lower leg. A bilateral lower limb venous Doppler ultrasound showed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). X-rays were normal with no evidence of bony or joint abnormality or fracture or dislocation. The patient was started on intravenous cefazolin and prednisolone 50 mg orally, emulsifying ointment; betamethasone valerate 0.01% and 0.05% and wet dressing for exacerbated eczema. The skin biopsies showed spongiotic dermatitis pattern which can be seen in eczema and the presence of occasional eosinophils also raised the possibility of a drug reaction.

CK and Troponin were negative. She had an episode of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) versus atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) of 175-205. She also had a five second syncopal episode with her heart rate decreasing to the 60s followed by a rate of around 110. The patient was admitted for atrial fibrillation with RVR, syncope and systemic inflammatory response (SIRS). Echocardiogram revealed pericardial effusion without hemodynamic compromise. She had a protracted clinical course and underwent an extensive diagnostic work-up and was diagnosed with autoimmune pericarditis/adult onset still's disease several months after treatment completion. It was noted that the patient responded well to corticosteroid and anakinra (antiinflammatory, IL-1 inhibitor) therapy. Medical history included hepatic cirrhosis, alcoholism and drug abuse. Two weeks after study treatment completion, the patient was found pulseless and apneic on the street. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was administered for one minute by Emergency Medical Services and was transported to the Emergency Room. The patient was given Narcan with good response. The patient reported taking Percocet and 'had been drinking" and experienced a "blackout." It was reported that the patient was using illicit Percocet.

The subject reported feeling very weak and tired recently and had difficulty walking up a flight of stairs due to shortness of breath. The subject reported a stress test done a year ago was normal. She also reported feeling her throat "closing up" and had some pain while swallowing. She denied any cough, dysuria or rashes. Upon arrival in the ER, her temperature was 100.6 (unit not reported) and had mild shortness of breath at rest. Laboratory results included troponin &lt;0.01 ng/ml (RR: 0.0-0.78), white blood cell count 3.4 K/uL (RR: 4.0-11.0), neutrophils 30% (RR: 45-75) and normal cardiac enzymes. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm. Chest x-ray was normal. Stress test showed mild abnormality (small amount of anterior septal reperfusion noted). The subject underwent a cardiac angiogram. Acute coronary syndrome was ruled out. Sepsis work-up was negative. RBV dose was reduced to 600 mg daily. The event of noncardiac chest pain was reported as resolved two days after ribavirin dose reduction. The investigator assessed the event leukopenia and fever, related to peginterferon alfa-2a, not related to other study drugs, and the event noncardiac chest pain not related to study drugs.</p></div>

At the Week 3 visit, the CK had increased to 8759 U/L. He did not report worsening of symptoms at that visit, and noted that he had been feeling so good since starting treatment, the preceding week at work he elected to perform the heaviest manual labor jobs available, and 1 day preceding the Week 3 visit he spent the entire day using a handsaw in both arms to saw wood. Local repeat blood work 2 days after the Week 3 visit demonstrated an elevated CK of 993 U/L, normal creatinine, and normal ECG. Study drugs were continued with a plan for close follow up. He was advised to reduce his physical activity. He returned to the clinic 4 days later (Day 29) for his Week 4 study visit and his CK was elevated at 2225 U/L (central laboratory). Study drugs were discontinued. During the posttreatment follow up period, the subject's symptoms of arthralgia, myalgia, and muscle twitching resolved. MRI of the cervical spine (19 days posttreatment) showed C6 and C7 nerve root compromise with prominent wasting of the distal triceps. On posttreatment Day 28, CK had returned to baseline with a value of 387 IU/L. However, at the posttreatment Week 24 visit, the subject's CK increased to 9121 U/L and he was referred to a rheumatologist for evaluation. An electromyography (EMG) demonstrated myopathic changes, and a muscle biopsy (253 days posttreatment) showed evidence for compensated denervation likely related to previous radiculopathy and no evidence for inflammatory myopathy.

CK elevations did not appear to be related to treatment duration with respect to time of onset in these subjects.</p><p>The following observations regarding CK elevations were noted by the Applicant.</p><p>• CK elevations were mostly mild to moderate in severity and not associated with the onset of musculoskeletal symptoms, and not related to cumulative study drug exposure. • Greater than or equal to Grade 3 CK elevations in SOF treatment groups in the primary safety population were mostly associated with increased physical activity levels. • The frequency of CK elevations was slightly higher in IFN-free treatment groups as compared to IFN containing treatment groups (with or without SOF) • There is no evidence of a causative relationship between SOF and CK elevations. • There is no current evidence for SOF-related musculoskeletal toxicity</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comments</head><p>The number of subjects with Grade 3 or Grade 4 CK elevations is low. No cases or rhabdomyolysis were reported in the development program. Due to presence of confounding factors such as increased physical activity in subjects with Grade 3 or Grade 4 levels it is challenging to assess any causal relationship between SOF use and CK elevations. However, the contributory role of sofosbuvir cannot be fully ruled out. Additional data from ongoing/future trials evaluating sofosbuvir may be helpful in further assessment of this finding. At this time, recommend including this information in the prescribing information to ensure that health care providers are aware and can monitor CK levels as clinically indicated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Renal Adverse Events</head><p>There were no cases of acute renal failure or renal dysfunction in the primary safety population. There were no Grade 3 or Grade 4 events of elevated creatinine levels. There was one report of increased creatinine leading to discontinuation of study drugs in a subject receiving SOF+PEG+RBV; this subject had a previously undisclosed history of renal dysfunction.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comments</head><p>No sofosbuvir-related renal toxicity has been identified in the sofosbuvir clinical development program to date.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse Events of Completed Suicide, Suicide Attempt, and Suicidal Ideation</head><p>Based on the Safety Reports submitted to the IND 106739, Gilead was requested to conduct a comprehensive assessment of sofosbuvir clinical development program of all cases of completed suicide, suicide attempt, and suicidal ideation.</p><p>Neuropsychiatric side effects associated with alpha interferon use include depression, anxiety, insomnia, emotional lability, mood disorders, frank psychosis, suicidal ideation, suicide, and homicide. There is not much published data on neuropsychiatric side effect profile of ribavirin in HCV infected patients as ribavirin is indicated in combination with pegylated interferon for treatment of CHC. However, the Applicant referenced three published studies of RBV monotherapy in which neuropsychiatric events of depression, irritability, anxiety, and insomnia were reported at higher frequency in subjects receiving ribavirin as compared to those receiving placebo.</p><p>Although more subjects in the SOF+RBV 12 Week and 16 Week groups (7.2%, 41 subjects and 6.1%, 6 subjects, respectively) had depression (AEs of depression or depressed mood) compared with the subjects in the Placebo group, incidence was lower compared to the PEG+RBV group (17.3%, 43 subjects). The rate of pre-existing depression in subjects enrolled in the SOF registrational Phase 3 trials ranged from 33% (NEUTRINO) to 55% (POSITRON).</p><p>In summary, in the 3488 HCV-infected subjects treated to date with sofosbuvir, only one subject committed suicide and suicidal ideation or suicide attempt were reported in 11 subjects (&lt; 1%). A summary of all these 11 cases was reviewed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Review</head><p>Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 Sofosbuvir 122 Subject #3317-8735 who was enrolled in Study GS-US-334-0123 (PHOTON-1) committed suicide 9 days after completing 12 weeks of treatment with SOF+RBV. No psychiatric AEs were reported while on treatment. Medical history was significant for HIV/HCV-coinfection, GERD, and insomnia, and psychiatric history was significant for ADHD. According to the investigator, the subject was acting differently towards his housemates after returning from a holiday visit with his family. Two days after his return, he left a voicemail for his girlfriend apologizing, stating he hated living in his residential program, and that he had lied to his parents about being laid off; he then jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge. The investigator considered the suicide unrelated to SOF and RBV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comments</head><p>Based on the review of data submitted to date, the incidence of adverse events of completed suicide, suicidal ideation or suicide attempt was low and were mostly observed in subjects with pre-existing psychiatric conditions and/or accompanied by major life stressors. Based on the available evidence, I agree with Applicant that sofosbuvir does not appear to contribute to the adverse events of suicide, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempt. At this time, these adverse events do not raise clinically significant safety concerns. We will continue to monitor for these adverse events in the postmarketing setting to identify any emerging safety signals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gastrointestinal Adverse Events</head><p>Due to observed findings of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and increased frequency and incidence of emesis and diarrhea in male dogs, a focused safety evaluation for gastrointestinal AEs was done.</p><p>The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea in SOF+RBV containing groups (SOF+RBV 12 Weeks; SOF+RBV 16 Weeks) was similar to the placebo group and was lower than the pegylated interferon-containing regimens (PEG+SOF+RBV 12 Weeks; PEG+RBV 24 Weeks).</p><p>A high level safety summary focused on gastrointestinal adverse events was also requested by the Applicant. Response received on June 25, 2013 is summarized here.</p><p>The Applicant noted that colitis and pancreatitis, sometimes fatal, have been observed in patients treated with interferon (IFN). Therefore, the high level summary of gastrointestinal events provided by the Applicant focused on these two conditions.</p><p>There was one report of colitis in the primary safety population. There was one case of pancreatitis in the primary safety population. Subject #5586-7268 was randomized to placebo treatment in Study GS-US-334-0107 (POSITRON). On Day 1, the subject was hospitalized for pancreatitis. He admitted to heavy alcohol use in the preceding week up to and including the day of hospitalization. The patient was also found to have choledocholithiasis on CT scan with mild dilation of the common bile duct.</p><p>There was one case of ischemic colitis reported in Study P7977-0724 (ATOMIC). Subject #1051-7234 was a 57 year old male in Study P7977-0724 randomized to SOF+PEG+RBV for 24 weeks. Medical history included hypertension for six months and short term diarrhea with rectal bleeding approximately a year ago (with no other signs and symptoms); resolved, no work-up was done. He experienced Grade 2 focal ischemic colitis, diarrhea, and Grade 3 abdominal pain on Day 52 that was assessed as unrelated to study drugs. He was hospitalized for ischemic colitis and experienced Grade 2 lower GI hemorrhage and flatulence. Ischemic colitis resolved without sequelae on Day 71 and the patient completed treatment per protocol. A mesenteric computerized tomography angiography of the abdomen and pelvis was performed and atherosclerotic changes were noted in the descending abdominal aorta and common iliac arteries. The investigator considered focal ischemic colitis was due to atherosclerosis.</p><p>There was one case of pancreatitis in the secondary safety population (N=711). Subject #1001-1067 was a 43 year old female in Study P7977-0221 (28-day study) with a past medical history relevant for alcohol abuse and diabetes complicated by peripheral neuropathy who was treated with SOF 400mg+PEG+RBV for 28 days followed by PEG+RBV for 44 weeks. She experienced Grade 2 acute pancreatitis requiring hospitalization 17 days after completing PEG+RBV treatment that was assessed as not related to study drugs. The event was considered resolved without sequelae on posttreatment Day 37.</p><p>There was one case of pancreatitis reported in the NIAID-sponsored Study 11-I-0258. There was one case of colitis in the AI444040 study. Colitis was reported 11.5 weeks after starting study drugs in a 49-year-old female subject receiving SOF+DCV (daclatasvir). Colitis resolved without treatment interruption, and was assessed as unrelated to study drugs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comment</head><p>There is no obvious safety concern of gastrointestinal toxicity associated with sofosbuvir use (as assessed by gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea and adverse events of colitis and pancreatitis).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Elevated Lipase Levels</head><p>Treatment-emergent lipase elevations were reported in 9-31% of subjects in the primary safety population <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 42</ref>). None of these isolated, sporadic elevations, with the exception of the pancreatitis case reported in the placebo group, was associated with clinical signs or symptoms of pancreatitis. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Elevated Bilirubin Levels</head><p>No Grade 4 elevations (&gt;5 x ULN) in total or direct bilirubin levels were noted in pivotal trials. The incidence of Grade 3 total bilirubin laboratory abnormalities was low in subjects in the SOF+RBV 12 Week (2.3%, 13 subjects) and SOF+RBV 16 Week group (2.0%, 2 subjects). No subjects in the SOF+PEG+RBV group had a Grade 3 or 4 total bilirubin laboratory abnormality <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 43</ref>). However, the SOF+PEG+RBV group had a higher overall incidence of graded total bilirubin abnormalities compared with the PEG+RBV group. This difference was likely due to the lower RBV dose (800 mg) in the PEG+RBV regimen compared with the weight-based RBV dosing (1000 or 1200 mg) in the SOF+PEG+RBV regimen. Increases from baseline in median total bilirubin values were observed in both the SOF+RBV groups, which peaked at Week 1 for the SOF+RBV 12 Week group and peaked at Week 2 for the SOF+RBV 16 Week group. Subsequently, median total bilirubin values decreased and were returning towards baseline levels by the end of study treatment.</p><p>Transient elevations of bilirubin (hyperbilirubinemia) are consistent with RBV-induced hemolysis. This is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, which shows that the elevations in bilirubin  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comments</head><p>Elevated bilirubin levels seen in clinical trials of sofosbuvir seem to be driven by ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia. Moreover, the levels peeked in the first 1-2 weeks and then returned to baseline values after completion of ribavirin-containing regimen. These isolated elevations in bilirubin values do not raise safety concerns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4">Supportive Safety Results</head><p>The supportive safety results have been integrated in the different sections of this review. Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined by the Applicant as the events that meet one of the following criteria:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4.1">Common Adverse Events</head><p>• Events with onset dates on or after the start of treatment and up to 30 days after the permanent discontinuation of the study regimen from each specified study phase, and continuing adverse events diagnosed prior to the start of treatment with worsening severity grade after the start of treatment</p><p>• Continuing adverse events that are serious or result in any study drug discontinuation</p><p>For Study GS-US-334-0108, AEs that occurred up to 30 days after the last dose of active study drugs (i.e., SOF and RBV) were included in the integrated safety analysis.</p><p>The AE tables in this section are derived from FDA analyses of the pooled data from Phase 3 pivotal trials. The AEs represented in the tables are without regard to drug causality, which in this reviewer's opinion is an appropriate way to present AE data for this application, as frequently reported adverse events are those observed with pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy.</p><p>A summary of AEs reported in ≥ 10% subjects in any group in the Primary Safety Population is provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 46</ref>.</p><p>The most frequently reported AEs in subjects in the SOF+RBV 12 Week and SOF+RBV 16 Week groups were <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 46)</ref> As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 44</ref>, the three most common AEs in subjects in the SOF+PEG+RBV group were fatigue (59%), headache (36%), and nausea (34%).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hematology Test Abnormalities</head><p>Anemia is the most common cause of RBV dose reduction. Guidance on the management of RBV dose reductions was provided in the protocol for each of the trials, based upon the RBV labeling. The number of subjects with hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL (the level that recommended RBV dose reduction per protocol) and &lt; 8.5 g/dL (the level that recommended RBV dose discontinuation per protocol) at any post baseline visits is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 45</ref>. Hemoglobin values of &lt; 10 g/dL and &lt; 8.5 g/dL are those recommended in the approved ribavirin package inserts for ribavirin dose-reduction and discontinuation, respectively.  Although the RBV dose of 800 mg in the PEG+RBV group was lower than the weightbased RBV dose of 1000 or 1200 mg in the SOF+RBV groups, the frequency of hemoglobin reductions (all grades) was similar across groups. These reductions could be due to the additive effect of PEG-related bone marrow suppression. When weightbased RBV dosing was administered with PEG (as in the SOF+PEG+RBV regimen), the rates of hemoglobin reduction were higher than with either SOF+RBV or PEG+RBV (800 mg), and the reticulocytosis observed at the same dose of RBV was lower in the SOF+PEG+RBV group compared with SOF+RBV groups. Similarly, the incidence of hyperbilirubinemia appeared to be directly related to the amount of hemolysis and degree of reticulocytosis; this was highest in the SOF+RBV group even though the rate of anemia was higher in the SOF+PEG+RBV group Week group, within the Primary Safety Population, the majority of on-treatment liver abnormalities were Criterion 3 (total bilirubin &gt; 2 × ULN). These analyses are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 47</ref>. In most cases, these total bilirubin elevations were isolated and transient and occurred for 1 or 2 visits. These events appeared consistent with RBV-associated hemolysis. These have been discussed earlier in Section 7.3.5. The subjects meeting criterion 1 and 2 are further discussed in this section.   • Only one subject had Criterion 2 on-treatment liver abnormality (ALT &gt; 5 × ULN). Subject #0530-1419 had an ALT value of 328 U/L (7.6 × ULN) on Day 10; however, baseline ALT values were also &gt; 5 × ULN (308 U/L). AST was also elevated to 4.6 × ULN (164 U/L) and alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin were within normal range. ALT and AST continued to decline over time and both were within normal range by Day 58.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Liver-related abnormalities, SOF+PEG+RBV (Primary Safety Population)</head><p>All of the on-treatment liver abnormalities occurring in SOF+PEG+RBV subjects in Study GS-US-334-0110 were either Criterion 2 (ALT &gt; 5 × ULN) or Criterion 3 (total bilirubin &gt; 2 × ULN). Nine subjects in had ALT ≥ 5 × ULN (Criterion 2): A total of six subjects had ALT &gt; 5 × ULN for 1 or 2 visits occurring between Days 9 and 69. In these subjects, elevations in AST occurred in parallel (range: 3.9−6.1 × ULN) and generally other liver chemistry parameters remained within normal range. Three subjects had ALT &gt; 5 × ULN for longer periods: All 9 subjects with on-treatment ALT &gt;5x ULN completed 12 weeks of treatment per protocol.</p><p>Three subjects also had total bilirubin &gt; 2 × ULN (Criterion 3). In all three subjects, total bilirubin elevations &gt; 2 × ULN (range: 2.1−2.4 × ULN) were isolated and transient and occurred during Weeks 1 and 2 only. Other liver chemistry parameters (ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase) were within normal range and these events appeared consistent with RBV-associated hemolysis.</p></div>

Two subjects in Study P7977-0724 had AST or ALT &gt; 3 × ULN and total bilirubin &gt; 2 × ULN at the same time point (Criterion 1) and are summarized below: permanently discontinued due to elevated liver abnormalities at this visit. The next day, the subject was admitted to a local hospital and the event was reported as an SAE of autoimmune hepatitis. A liver biopsy revealed severe inflammatory activity and areas of multiacinar collapse, and a differential diagnosis of concurrent autoimmune hepatitis versus drug-induced liver injury was reported.</p><p>Although the subject underwent preparation for a liver transplant, her laboratory tests significantly improved and by posttreatment Day 20, all liver parameters had decreased but remained abnormal. Her physical examination on Day 20 was unremarkable except for mild jaundice and right upper quadrant mild discomfort but with no hepatosplenomegaly. The subject was advised to complete Week 4 of steroid therapy during the next week. The autoimmune process was considered stable with prednisone 10 mg once daily treatment. Detailed past medical history revealed a diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (an autoimmune disease).</p></div>

In P7977-0221, both subjects had transient ALT &gt; 5 × ULN and also AST &gt; 5 × ULN elevations for one visit (either Week 24 or 28); these two subjects received treatment with PEG+RBV after discontinuing SOF on Day 28. Both subjects completed treatment with PEG+RBV.</p><p>In P7977-0724, five subjects had ALT ≥ 5 × ULN that began between Days 8 and 64. Increases in AST ≥ 5 × ULN occurred in parallel, although other liver chemistry parameters (total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase) generally remained within normal range throughout the trial. Four subjects completed their assigned study treatment. One subject (Subject #1015-7064) had elevated ALT &gt; 5 × ULN and AST &gt; 5 × ULN on Day 29 that was reported as a clinical Grade 3 AE of hepatic enzyme increased, although other liver chemistry parameters remained within normal range (Day 29 to posttreatment Day 28). Study drugs were discontinued on Day 32 because of this AE. Final ALT and AST values at posttreatment Day 28 were within normal range.</p></div>

The largest upper bounds of the 2-sided 90% CI for the mean differences between sofosbuvir (400 mg and 1200 mg) and placebo were below 10 ms, the threshold for regulatory concern as described in ICH E14 guidelines. The largest lower bound of the 2-sided 90% CI for the ΔΔQTcF for moxifloxacin was greater than 5 ms, and the moxifloxacin profile over time is adequately demonstrated (shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref> of the IRT review, not included in this review), indicating that assay sensitivity was established.</p><p>This was a randomized, blinded, placebo and positive controlled, four period cross over trial, 60 subjects received sofosbuvir 400 mg, sofosbuvir 1200 mg, placebo, and moxifloxacin 400 mg.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Review</head><p>Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 Sofosbuvir 141 Some of the secondary objectives of this trial are as follows:</p><p>• To determine if the administration of a combination of SOF and RBV to HCVinfected subjects with HCC meeting the Milan criteria prior to undergoing liver transplantation can elicit a sustained viral response as determined by HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ 12 weeks after the discontinuation of therapy (SVR12). • To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a combination of SOF+RBV in HCVinfected subjects prior to undergoing liver transplantation.</p><p>This trial is being conducted at 14 centers in the US, 1 center in New Zealand, and 1 center in Spain. Subjects must have been listed for liver transplantation for HCC (meeting the Milan criteria) secondary to HCV-related cirrhosis with a MELD score of &lt; 22 and an HCC-weighted MELD score of ≥ 22 and a Child-Pugh Turcotte (CPT) score ≤ 7.</p><p>Enrolled subjects will receive oral SOF 400 mg once daily and RBV 1000 or 1200 mg (administered as a divided dose, BID) for a maximum of 24 weeks (before Protocol Amendment 4) or a maximum of 48 weeks (after Protocol Amendment 4) or until time of transplant, whichever comes first. Treatment will be discontinued within 24 hours prior to the liver transplant if it occurs before the subject has completed their 24-or 48-week treatment course, as appropriate.</p><p>Subjects who experience post-treatment viral relapse and have no resistance mutations (before Protocol Amendment 4); subjects who stopped treatment at Week 24 and are currently in post-treatment follow-up; and subjects who reach Week 24 and have not yet been transplanted (after Protocol Amendment 4) may receive up to 24 additional weeks of treatment in the retreatment substudy. For purposes of analysis, only those subjects who completed Week 24 of study treatment, relapsed in post-treatment follow-up, and then restarted on SOF+RBV study treatment will be included in the "Relapsers Retreated with SOF+RBV" analysis set. Subject #7585-7709 had HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ (16 weeks post-treatment) when Protocol Amendment 4 was approved and did not consent to restarting study drug. All other subjects who were in posttreatment follow-up and waiting for transplant at the time of Amendment 4 approval had HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ. For purposes of analysis, subjects who continued on treatment (without interruption) at the Week 24 visit will be analyzed with the "main part" of the pre-transplant phase of the trial.</p><p>Once a subject received a cadaveric organ, they entered the posttransplant follow-up phase for up to 48 weeks and were followed closely for evidence of recurrent HCV infection as determined by HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ. The planned posttransplantation immunosuppressive regimen during the first 12 weeks posttransplant is as follows:</p><p>• Solumedrol/Prednisone (tapered over approximately 7 days) Of the 61 subjects who received at least one dose of study drugs (safety analysis set), 9 subjects (14.8%) were on treatment in the pretransplant phase at the time of the data cutoff for updated response, 29 subjects (47.5%) have undergone liver transplantation while on treatment, 8 subjects (13.1%) completed 24 weeks of treatment and subsequently have undergone a liver transplantation, 2 subjects (3.3%) completed 24 weeks of treatment and were prematurely terminated from the trial due to disease progression, 7 subjects (11.5%) relapsed during posttreatment follow-up and were retreated with SOF+RBV in the retreatment substudy, and 6 subjects (9.8%) prematurely discontinued treatment <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 50</ref>). Of the 6 subjects who prematurely discontinued treatment, 4 subjects (6.6%) had efficacy failure (2 breakthrough and 2 nonresponse) and 2 subjects (3.3%) discontinued due to an AE. Of the subjects who prematurely discontinued the trial, 5 subjects (8.2%) died, 3 subjects (4.9%) had efficacy failure, and 3 (4.9%) subjects had progressive disease and were no longer transplant candidates. Five subjects (one with HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ on the day of transplantation was not discontinued from the trial) had on-treatment virologic failure (3 breakthroughs and 2 non-response).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comments</head><p>Additional data on the above noted five subjects has been requested from the Applicant.</p><p>A total of 11 of 15 subjects, who completed 24 weeks of treatment and had an observed or imputed Week 4 posttreatment follow-up HCV RNA value, relapsed during posttreatment follow-up. Of these 11 subjects, two subjects underwent a liver transplantation before they were able to receive an additional 24 weeks of retreatment, two subjects had progressive disease and were no longer transplant candidates, and seven subjects were retreated with SOF+RBV. Of the seven retreated subjects, three subjects continue on retreatment and four have undergone a liver transplantation at the time of the data cutoff for this response. Of the four retreatment subjects who underwent a liver transplantation, two subjects died (Subjects #1028-7706 and #1028-7724); one subject had a graft loss 2 days posttransplant (Subject #7585-7710), was retransplanted 3 days later and has achieved pTVR12; and one subject had recurrent HCV infection at posttransplant Week 4 (Subject #7585-7731).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comments</head><p>The outcome in three out of the four retreatment subjects who underwent a liver transplantation was not favorable. At the time of this updated report submission, 35 of 37 subjects have been followed to posttransplant Week 12 and 23 subjects (65.7%) had HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ. Of the 24 subjects who have reached 24 weeks posttransplantation, 17 (70.8%) had HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 51</ref>). Addition of another DAA might potentially improve the response rates in hard-to-treat pretransplant population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interim Safety Results</head><p>The mean exposure to SOF+RBV prior to transplantation was 17.7 weeks for subjects in the FAS with any treatment duration and HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ before transplantation. The mean exposure to retreatment SOF+RBV for subjects who had relapsed and were being retreated with SOF+RBV in the retreatment substudy was 13.2 weeks. resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was done which showed diffuse interstitial infiltrate throughout the right lung with patchy consolidative opacities in the right lung base. The diagnosis was changed to pneumonitis, not yet determined (NYD). Rheumatology work-up for immune-mediated lung injury was negative. The patient required intubation. Due to concern for interstitial lung disease (ILD), the patient was started on high dose intravenous solumedrol. Lung biopsies showed: "right lung, middle lobe: organizing acute lung injury with organizing pneumonia and right lung, upper lobe: organizing acute lung injury with organizing pneumonia". The investigator's overall assessment was that the most likely sequence of events was: 1) viral URI --&gt; 2) bacterial superinfection (pneumonia) --&gt; 3) partial control of infection via antibiotics preventing florid sepsis --&gt; 4) progression of infection vs infection related ARDS to involve bilateral lung fields --&gt; 5) hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation --&gt; 6) infection/inflammation related necrosis leading to pulmonary hemorrhage-improvement in right sided disease with residual LLL consolidation, persistent interstitial fibrosis and new bronchopleural fistula. After a prolonged clinical course, the subject died 38 days after the last dose of study drugs. o Subject #1028-7705 died 6 days after the first liver transplantation, which resulted in primary graft non-function (Grade 4 acute hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis starting on Day 1 after transplant). The subject underwent a second liver transplantation 3 days after the first transplantation (Grade 5 acute renal failure started on Day 1 after the second transplantation), which also resulted in graft failure and renal failure. The subject died 3 days after the second liver transplantation. Study drugs were stopped on the day of the first transplant (6 days prior to death). These events were considered not related to study drug. o Subject #1028-7706, who relapsed and was retreated with SOF+RBV, received a liver transplantation that resulted in graft failure. The subject had cardiogenic shock resulting in a low-flow state on the day of transplant, and developed hepatic artery thrombosis on the day after transplantation (Grade 4 hepatic artery thrombosis and renal failure). Despite aggressive management and surgical removal of the hepatic artery thrombosis, the subject died of cardiogenic shock 3 days after the transplant. Study drugs were stopped on the day before the transplant (4 days prior to death). These events were considered not related to study drug. o Subject #1028-7724, who relapsed and was retreated with SOF+RBV, had a Grade 4 AE of hepatic artery thrombosis on the day of liver transplantation leading to graft dysfunction. The subject developed renal failure the day after transplantation. The subject underwent a second liver transplantation 5 days after the first transplantation. The subject developed sepsis after the second transplantation, which led to death 14 days after the first transplant, and 9 days after the second transplant. All study drugs were stopped on the day prior to the first transplant. These events were considered not related to study drug.</p></div>

Twelve subjects (38.7%) had the IL28B CC allele. A total of 23 subjects (74.2%) were IFN eligible. Each of the 8 IFN-ineligible subjects (25.8%) had significant psychiatric disease as the reason for ineligibility, 1 of whom also had autoimmune disorder and 1 of whom also had seizure disorder. More than half of subjects (61.3%) had CD4 T-lymphocyte counts ≥ 500 cells/mm 3 . The mean baseline CD4 T-lymphocyte count in the safety analysis set was 601 cells/mm 3 . Most subjects were on ARV treatment at study enrollment (87.1%).</p><p>Of the 27 subjects on ARVs during the treatment period, all took an emtricitabine/tenofovir-based regimen that was combined with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (n = 13), a boosted PI (n = 9), or an integrase inhibitor (n = 5).</p></div>

Of the seven subjects with virologic failure, six subjects relapsed, all of whom had genotype 3 HCV infection and an IL28B non-CC genotype, and one subject had on-treatment virologic failure at Week 10. The reasons subjects with HCV genotype 2 infection did not achieve SVR4 were lost to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, and on-treatment virologic failure likely due to study drug nonadherence.</p><p>Two of the four subjects who prematurely discontinued treatment had posttreatment Week 4 HCV RNA assessments; one subject relapsed after receiving approximately 6 weeks of treatment (discontinued due to investigator decision) and one subject had SVR4 after receiving approximately 10 weeks of treatment (discontinued due to AEs).</p><p>Two subjects who were receiving ARV treatment had HIV-1 virologic rebound during the SOF+RBV treatment:</p><p>o Subject #4262-8725 (Group 1; treatment-naive with genotype 2 or 3 HCV infection) was receiving ARV treatment with RAL and FTC/TDF.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Age</head><p>None of the sofosbuvir Phase 3 trials imposed an upper age limit as part of the trial entry criteria. An age cutoff of &lt; 65 and ≥ 65 years was chosen to evaluate elderly subjects. Across the 5 treatment groups in the Primary Safety Population, 66 subjects (5.1%) were ≥ 65 years of age. The mean (SD) age across the groups was 51 (10.3) years.</p><p>In the SOF+RBV 12 Week group, anemia was reported at a higher frequency in subjects aged ≥ 65 years compared with &lt; 65 years (anemia: 18.5%, 5 subjects vs 9.8%, 53 subjects). In the SOF+RBV 16 Week group, only 4 subjects (4.1%) reported AEs of anemia, with 1 subject aged ≥ 65 years. However, a higher frequency of anemia was also reported in the PEG+RBV group, in subjects aged ≥ 65 years compared with &lt; 65 years (anemia: 45.5%, 5 subjects vs 9.9%, 23 subjects). Hence, any effects on anemia noted in older subjects may not be associated with sofosbuvir use.</p><p>In the SOF+PEG+RBV group, anemia was the only AE reported at a 2-fold higher incidence in subjects aged ≥ 65 years compared with &lt; 65 years. As noted by the Applicant, no other differences indicative of a sofosbuvir-containing regimen treatment effect were apparent for any other AEs or Grade 3 or 4 AEs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gender</head><p>In the SOF+RBV 12 and 16 Week groups , the incidence of overall AEs was slightly higher for female subjects compared with male subjects (approximately 93% vs 85%); however, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 AEs was similar between male and female subjects.</p><p>Female subjects had a higher incidence of AEs leading to dose modification or interruption of study drug compared with male subjects in the SOF+RBV 12 Week group (22.0%, 45 subjects vs 5.0%, 18 subjects) and SOF+RBV 16 Week group (19.4%, 6 subjects vs 1.5%, 1 subject). Dose modification or interruption was allowed per study protocol for RBV or RBV placebo only; no dose modification of SOF was permitted. Female subjects had a higher incidence of AEs leading to modification or interruption of study drug compared with male subjects in the SOF+PEG+RBV group (47% and 26% respectively). In the PEG+RBV group, female subjects had a higher incidence of dose Clinical Review Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 Sofosbuvir 153 modifications or interruptions compared with male subjects (33% and 23% respectively).

Overall, this difference in part could be explained by the trend of generally lower pretreatment hemoglobin levels in female subjects. In addition, based on lower median BMIs, female subjects may have had higher overall exposures to RBV from the weight-based RBV dosing in Phase 3 trials.</p><p>In the SOF+PEG+RBV, anemia was the only AE reported at a 2-fold higher incidence in female subjects (32%) compared with male subjects (14%).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjects with Cirrhosis</head><p>Subjects with cirrhosis were enrolled in pivotal trials; however, cirrhotic subjects with decompensation were excluded. In the SOF+RBV 12 Week and SOF+RBV 16 Week groups, overall no differences indicative of a SOF-containing regimen treatment effect were noted on the incidence of any AE, or any Grade 3 or 4 AE, when cirrhotic subjects were compared with noncirrhotic subjects. There was no apparent difference in the incidence of AEs that led to dose modification or interruptions in cirrhotic compared with noncirrhotic subjects in the SOF+RBV 12 Week and SOF+RBV 16 Week groups.</p><p>In the SOF+PEG+RBV group, anemia and neutropenia were reported at a higher incidence in cirrhotics (32% and 22% respectively) compared with noncirrhotic subjects (19% and 15% respectively). There was a higher incidence of AEs leading to modification or interruption of study drug (PEG and/or RBV) in cirrhotic subjects as compared with non-cirrhotic subjects in the SOF+PEG+RBV group (44%, 24 subjects vs. 31%, 85 subjects).</p><p>The overall incidence of total bilirubin abnormalities (all grades) was higher in cirrhotic compared with noncirrhotic subjects in the SOF+RBV 12 Week (39.7%, 46 subjects vs. 27.1%, 121 subjects) and SOF+RBV 16 Week groups (50.0%, 16 subjects vs. 31.8%, 21 subjects). In the SOF+PEG+RBV group, the only difference in overall graded laboratory abnormalities between cirrhotics and non-cirrhotics was total bilirubin (35.2%, 19 subjects, vs. 14.7%, 40 subjects). A similar trend was observed for the PEG+RBV group (20.0%, 10 subjects vs. 8.9%, 17 subjects), which indicates that cirrhotic subjects are more likely to develop hyperbilirubinemia in response to RBV-associated hemolytic anemia due to the decreased hepatic function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comments</head><p>The available clinical data across the development program supports the use of sofosbuvir 400 mg without dose modification in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment.</p></div>

Doses of SOF above the therapeutic dose (400 mg) have been administered in two Phase 1 trials. The highest dose of SOF administered in clinical trials to date was a single supratherapeutic dose of SOF 1200 mg to 59 healthy subjects in Study P7977-0613. As reported by the Applicant, the observed AEs were similar in frequency and severity to those reported in the placebo and SOF 400 mg treatment groups.</p><p>There is no specific antidote for sofosbuvir. The Applicant has noted that hemodialysis can remove the predominant circulating metabolite GS-331007 with an extraction ratio of 53%.</p><p>Sofosbuvir is not expected to have abuse or dependence potential.

Pertinent information provided through these responses is incorporated throughout this review in relevant sections.</p><p>The Applicant submitted the Safety Update Report on July 08, 2013 (90 days after the submission of the original NDA as was previously agreed). The report provides the available updated safety data from ongoing sofosbuvir-containing trials. The Applicant presented sofosbuvir safety data from 20 Gilead-sponsored clinical trials, 2 individual investigator compassionate-use protocols, and 3 non-Gilead-sponsored trials. The data submitted in the safety report by the Applicant has been summarized in this section and has also been integrated into other sections of this review as relevant. No independent analyses have been done for the data provided in the safety update.</p><p>This section summarizes the data included in safety update on Phase 2 and 3 trials that was not included with the original NDA submission. These trials are: P2938-0721 (QUANTUM), Re-treatment group; P7977-0523 (ELECTRON), Groups 10 and 11 (Part 4); GS-US-334-0109; GS-US-334-0114; GS-US-334-0125; GS-US-334-0126; and GS-US-334-0133 (VALENCE). The data presented by the Applicant is cumulative from the initiation of the clinical trials to the safety update data cutoff dates. This Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial evaluated efficacy, PK, PD, safety, and tolerability of SOF in combination with GS-0938 (guanidine nucleotide analog, an NS5B inhibitor) and/or RBV for 12 or 24 weeks in subjects with genotype 1 through 6 HCV infection. Due to ALT elevations associated with GS-0938 treatment, on December 16, 2011 Pharmasset, Inc. (subsequently acquired by Gilead) notified sites to immediately discontinue all study drugs in all subjects who were receiving GS-0938. Discontinued study drugs included GS-0938 monotherapy or GS-0938 in combination with SOF, with or without RBV. These subjects were monitored weekly for the first 4 weeks after discontinuing therapy and then biweekly during a safety follow-up period (12 weeks after the last dose of GS-0938). Following the safety follow-up period, subjects who were eligible based on ALT and HCV RNA values received SOF 400 mg once daily + RBV 1000 or 1200 mg daily (divided dose) for 24 weeks.</p><p>A total of 132 subjects were enrolled in the re-treatment group and received at least one dose of study drug, out of which 123 subjects (93.2%) completed study drug treatment. A total of 9 subjects (6.8%) did not complete study drug treatment: 5 subjects (3.8%) discontinued for other reasons, 2 subjects (1.5%) discontinued due to an AE, 1 subject (0.8%) was lost to follow-up, and 1 subject (0.8%) withdrew consent.</p><p>The mean age was 52 years (range, 19 to 74 years). The majority of subjects were male (56%), white (86%), and non-Hispanic/Latino (90%). Black or African American subjects and subjects of other race comprised 9.8% and 4.5% of subjects, respectively. The mean baseline body mass index (BMI) was 27.7 kg/m 2 , and most subjects (68.2%) had a baseline BMI &lt; 30 kg/m2. The majority of subjects had genotype 1a HCV infection (60.6%) while 18.9%, 9.8%, 8.3%, and 2.3% of subjects had genotype 1b, 2, 3, and 4 HCV infection, respectively. The majority of subjects (58%) had a baseline HCV RNA ≥ 6 log 10 IU/mL, and 9.8% of subjects had cirrhosis. The majority of subjects had an IL28B gene (IL28B) non-CC allele (67%).</p><p>The mean exposure to study drug for the SOF+RBV re-treatment group was 23.4 weeks.

All SAEs were considered not related to SOF+RBV, except for the SAEs of increased amylase and increased lipase in Subject #4021-2103, which were considered related to SOF+RBV treatment. The SAEs of increased amylase and increased lipase both started on Day 18, were ongoing at the time of safety update data cutoff date, and led to no action taken with SOF or RBV. It was noted that this subject had no clinical signs or symptoms of pancreatitis.</p><p>Nine subjects had Grade 3 AEs that were considered related to SOF+RBV: one subject in Group 1 (anemia), one subject in Group 2 (liver function test abnormal), and seven subjects in Group 3 (amylase increased, anemia [n = 2], asthenia, fatigue [n = 2], headache, and lipase increased). For most treatment-related Grade 3 AEs, no action on study drugs was taken. For all 3 Grade 3 AEs of anemia, RBV dose was either interrupted (Subject #2716-2419) or reduced (Subjects #3912-2188 and 6830-2373).

The subject reported the symptoms of "lump in throat, awareness of heart beat and that it was out of rhythm," breathlessness, cough, and inability to sleep. These symptoms were similar to those experienced during previous episodes prior to trial participation. "Ventricular ectopics" were noted on ECG during hospitalization. The subject was discharged on bisoprolol and zopiclone (sleep aid) the following day and the event was considered resolved with sequelae.</p><p>Subject #1081-2327 in Group 1 (SOF+RBV 12 Weeks) discontinued SOF+RBV due to AEs of malaise and headache. Both of these Grade 2 events started on Day 31 and resolved on posttreatment Day 10, and were considered related to SOF and RBV.</p><p>Grade 3 or 4 ALT elevations reported in this trial are listed below: o In Group 1, Subject #5528-2236 (Grade 2 ALT at baseline) had normal ALT values Weeks 1 through 12. In the setting of virologic relapse, had Grade 4 ALT level of 401 U/L at posttreatment Week 4. o In Group 3, Subject #1088-2273 and Subject #1386-2171 had baseline ALT of Grade 2 (175 and 176 U/L, respectively) which increased to Grade 3 ALT at Week 1 (247 and 223 U/L, respectively) before normalizing on treatment. o In Group 3, Subject #4021-2103 (Grade 2 ALT at baseline) and Subject #0487-2357 (Grade 1 ALT at baseline) had isolated occurrences of Grade 4 ALT at Week 16 and 6, respectively.</p><p>Two subjects in Group 3 had Grade 4 lipase abnormalities. This Phase 2, ongoing, open-label trial is evaluating the efficacy and safety of SOF and RBV for 48 weeks in HCV-infected subjects with cirrhosis and portal hypertension with or without liver decompensation. Patients with Child-Turcotte-Pugh scores up to 10 (Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A and B) and the presence of esophageal or gastric varices with hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) &gt; 6 were included. At the time of the 90day safety update, 20 subjects had been enrolled with mean treatment duration of 9.5 weeks for the 9 patients randomized to SOF+RBV treatment. The mean age was 57 years (range 44 to 69 years), mean BMI 30, baseline Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores ranged from 6 to 19. The Applicant notes that the safety of SOF+RBV in these patients has been similar to what was observed in the pre-transplant patients. There have been no Grade 3 or 4 AEs, and only a single SAE of ascites reported to date. No patients discontinued treatment due to AEs. Laboratory abnormalities were consistent with RBV-associated hemolysis with a mean reduction in hemoglobin of -2.8 g/dL at Week 12. No additional safety issues have been identified in these patients as per the Applicant.</p></div>

This pregnancy was not medically confirmed and the partner was lost to follow-up.</p><p>Other Notable Adverse Events in the Safety Update -Subject #1543-9011 (Study GS-US-334-0109) in Group 1 (SOF+RBV 12 Weeks group) discontinued SOF and RBV on Day 16 due to the Grade 1 AE of dyspnea and Grade 2 AE of tinnitus. Subject is a 69-year-old white, Hispanic male with past medical history significant for GERD, benign prostate hypertrophy, diverticulosis, and a history of seizure related to a traumatic brain injury and jaw fracture. The subject experienced mild dyspnea on Day 12 and moderate pulsatile tinnitus of the right ear on Day 15. Both were considered unrelated to study drug by the investigator. Study drugs were discontinued on Day 12 -at the onset of dyspnea. The dyspnea resolved and the tinnitus remained ongoing at the week 4 follow-up visit (Day 27).</p><p>-Subject #0532-9082 (Study GS-US-334-0109) in Group 1 (SOF+RBV 12 Weeks group) had a Grade 4 increased lipase. The subject had normal lipase at baseline and through Week 2 visit, and then had a single occurrence of an asymptomatic Grade 4 increased lipase at Week 4. Lipase levels returned to normal from Week 6 through posttreatment Week 4.</p><p>-Three subjects in the SOF+RBV 24 Week group (Study GS-US-334-0114, a Phase 2 trial in HCV GT4 infected Egyptian adults) had SAEs (all were Grade 3, considered not related to SOF+RBV, and did not result in treatment discontinuation): o Subject #0407-8494 had abdominal pain, which started on Day 91 and was ongoing at the time of the data cutoff date; o Subject #0407-8488 had chest pain (subject is a 65-year-old Caucasian female with past medical history significant for hypokalemia, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, diabetes mellitus, shortness of breath and heart burn presented with complaints of non-radiating left sided chest pain associated with shortness of breath on study Day 53. Pain improved with Motrin. Stress test was negative for ischemia. Ejection fraction was noted as 43% with mild diffuse global hypokinesia. Hemoglobin was 11.6 g/dl and Troponin I was &lt;0.01 ng/ml (RR:0-0.10). ECG revealed sinus tachycardia. Chest pain resolved on Day 54. No actions were taken with the study drugs. The investigator assessed the event not related to the study medications. Alternative causality was provided as pre-existing condition. o Subject #0407-8441 had loss of consciousness. Subject is a 57 year old Caucasian male with past medical history significant for cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and mild mitral valve regurgitation. Concomitant medications included Cardio Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), Perindopril EG, and metformin.

Majority of the AEs reported in the Study GS-US-334-0108 were Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate) in severity. No treatment-emergent deaths were reported in this trial. No subjects in the SOF+RBV 12 Week group had a Grade 4 (life-threatening) AE. Only one subject (Subject #0519-1532) in the SOF+RBV 16 Week group had a Grade 4 AE (opiate overdose), which was reported as serious. The observed serious adverse events in the trial are shown in Table 10 below. None of the reported serious adverse events were considered treatment-related.</note></figure>

Malignant hepatic neoplasm and anemia were the only Grade 3 AEs reported in more than one subject. Grade 3 malignant hepatic neoplasm was reported for three subjects (2.9%) in the SOF+RBV 12 Week group and none of the subjects in the SOF+RBV 16 Week group. Grade 3 anemia was reported for two subjects (1.9%) in the SOF+RBV 12 Week group and none of the subjects in the SOF+RBV 16 Week group. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 AEs that were considered related to study drug by the investigator was low (four subjects (3.9%) in the SOF+RBV 12 Week group and two subjects (2%) in the SOF+RBV 16 Week group).

This difference could be attributed to the lower dose of RBV (800 mg daily) used in PEG+RBV control group compared to weight-based RBV dosing in SOF+PEG+RBV group.A higher proportion of subjects in PEG+RBV containing arms experienced hemoglobin nadirs of ≤10 g/dL and ≤ 8.5 g/dL than subjects who received SOF+RBV alone. This could be attributed to longer duration of treatment in the PEG+RBV group as compared with the SOF+RBV groups.Table 46).

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_143"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Decreased neutrophil counts (20.2%, 66 subjects) and decreased hemoglobin (27.2%, 89 subjects) were the most commonly reported Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities in the SOF+PEG+RBV group in the Primary Safety Population(Table 46). This finding was consistent with the expected bone marrow suppressive effects of PEG and the hemolytic anemia observed with RBV treatment in this subject population. Neutrophil levels returned to near-baseline values at the posttreatment Week 4 visit. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophils was slightly higher frequency in the SOF+PEG+RBV group compared with the PEG+RBV group (20.2%, 66 subjects and 14.9%, 36 subjects, respectively). This decrease may be due to the difference in baseline neutrophil counts in the 2 treatment groups: the SOF+PEG+RBV group had overall lower baseline neutrophil counts as compared with the PEG+RBV group. A higher percentage of black subjects in the SOF+PEG+RBV group compared with the PEG+RBV group may account for these differences in baseline neutrophil values (16.5% and 2.1%, respectively).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comments</head><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a known complication of cirrhosis in this patient population. All three subjects with malignant hepatic neoplasm had documented evidence of baseline cirrhosis either on histology or imaging study.</p><p>Selected case narratives of SAEs are summarized below due to their clinical significance.</p><p>Subject ID: [GS-US-334-0107] 0407-7218 Acute pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis was reported in a 67-year-old Caucasian female patient approximately 6 weeks after study treatment completion. Medical history included back pain. Concomitant medications included ondansetron, ibuprofen, pregabalin, oxycodone/paracetamol and triamcinolone. The patient was admitted with symptoms of severe abdominal pain. Initial lipase level was 3,769 (units not reported). Amylase level was 1000 (no unit reported). CT scan findings were consistent with acute pancreatitis and no gallstones were found. The patient was discharged after 3 days. The event was considered resolved. The investigator assessed the event not related to study drugs. No alternative causality was provided.</p><p>Subject ID: [GS-US-334-0107] 1069-7352 Hypoglycemic episode A 55-year-old Caucasian male subject was receiving treatment with SOF+RBV. Medical history included: diabetes mellitus type 1, insomnia, GERD and hypertension. Concomitant medications included temazepam, omeprazole, clazapril, amlodipine, aspirin, nova rapid, protophane, and fluvax. Around TW 6, the patient was admitted due to hypoglycemic episode. While shopping, the subject felt faint and ate a Snicker's bar and drank some milk. His blood sugar was found to be 11 (unit not reported) and blood pressure was low. It was reported that the subject had two hypoglycemic episodes in the past two days and has had a recent change of insulin regimen. The investigator assessed the event not related to study drugs. Alternative explanation included the subject's  o One subject in GS-US-334-0123 who met Criterion 2 (Subject #0994-8731) had elevated ALT at baseline (74 U/L) and an ALT nadir at Week 1 (53 U/L), but subsequently did not achieve any value within normal range. ALT steadily increased to 5.7 × ULN (193 U/L) at Day 70 (Week 10). AST also increased to a peak at 114 U/L on Day 70 as well. Mild increases in total bilirubin were noted from Week 4 onward but remained &lt; 2 × ULN. There were no concurrent AEs observed during the study period. Both ALT and AST values decreased by posttreatment Week 4 to 98 U/L and 70 U/L, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comments</head><p>Marked elevations in ALT levels (5-to 10-fold above the upper limit of normal) have been reported in one percent of subjects during treatment and follow-up in hepatitis C trials for Pegasys. Transient elevations in ALT (2-to 5-fold above baseline) were observed in 10% of subjects treated with PegIntron, and were not associated with deterioration of other liver functions (Re: USPI for Pegasys and PegIntron). No specific safety concern related to hepatotoxicity associated with sofosbuvir use has been identified to date.</p></div>

Systemic exposure (Cmax) to GS-331007 at 1500 mg/kg/day in the study was approximately 90-fold greater than the exposure in HCV-infected subjects at the recommended dose of 400 mg. No QT, electrocardiogram, or waveform changes were observed in a cardiovascular safety pharmacology study in dogs with oral GS-9851 at up to 1000 mg/kg, doses of SOF at 500 mg/kg/day for up to 9 months, or GS-9851 at 500 mg/kg/day for 28 days.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-Transplant Population</head><p>Recurrence of HCV infection after liver transplantation is almost universal. The rate of fibrosis progression in these patients is accelerated compared to non-transplant HCV patients with approximately 10-30% developing cirrhosis within 5 years of transplant. Moreover, liver transplant recipients with chronic HCV have a significantly lower 5-year survival compared to other recipients due to a higher rate of graft failure from recurrent disease <ref type="bibr">(Fontana et al. Liver Transplantation 2012)</ref>. There are currently no approved therapies to prevent recurrence of HCV infection post liver transplant.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.6.1">Human Carcinogenicity</head><p>The maximum study duration of sofosbuvir trials (approximately 48 weeks) limits the assessment for oncologic events. Most of the reported malignancies are those consistent with the patient population and no clustering of any particular events was noted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.6.2">Human Reproduction and Pregnancy Data</head><p>Because ribavirin is genotoxic and teratogenic, pregnancy was one of the exclusion criterion during the clinical development program of sofosbuvir. Breastfeeding women were excluded as well. Women of childbearing potential included in trials were required to use two effective methods of birth control. In addition, urine pregnancy testing was performed at regular intervals during the trial as defined in each protocol. Pregnancy, once determined, was a condition for required withdrawal of the subject from the trial.</p><p>In total, there have been three pregnancies reported in clinical trials in the SOF clinical development program. These are briefly described below:</p><p>-Two of the pregnancies were reported in the female partners of male study subjects. Both female partners were pregnant at the start of the trial. An analysis of hypersensitivity AEs was performed by the Applicant for all clinical trials submitted to the NDA 204671 and/or the 90-day safety update. As per the Applicant, no subject experienced any acute type 1 hypersensitivity AE in any sofosbuvir-containing treatment arm. Hypersensitivity occurred in none or less than 1% of active treatment arms. There were no Grade 3 or 4 hypersensitivity events reported in any subject receiving sofosbuvir. No subjects had any dose reduction, treatment interruption or discontinuation of study drugs due to hypersensitivity. No cases of angioedema were reported in any sofosbuvirtreated subject across the sofosbuvir clinical program, and no subject with hypersensitivity experienced any increase in eosinophil count. As per the Applicant, "There is no current evidence for SOF-related hypersensitivity as assessed by the AEs of hypersensitivity in the SOF clinical development program".</p><p>No deaths were reported during the re-treatment period.</p><p>Decreased hemoglobin (18 subjects, 13.7%) was the most frequently observed Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality; decreased lymphocytes and increased lipase (5 subjects each, 3.8%) and hyperglycemia and hyperbilirubinemia (2 subjects each, 1.5%) also occurred in more than one subject. Hemolysis-related increases in total bilirubin were not associated with increases in ALT levels. No Grade 3 or 4 ALT laboratory abnormalities were observed. No unusual pattern of AEs or laboratory abnormalities was observed in the presented data for SOF+RBV 24 Week regimen. Adverse event profile was similar to that described with 12 or 16 week SOF-containing regimens.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comment</head><p>Study GS-US-334-0133 (VALENCE)</p><p>This Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is evaluating the efficacy and safety of SOF and RBV treatment for 12 or 24 weeks in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced subjects with genotype 2 or 3 HCV infection. Subjects were randomized in a 4:1 ratio to receive SOF 400 mg once daily + RBV 1000 or 1200 mg daily (divided dose) or SOF placebo once daily + RBV placebo twice daily, and the planned treatment duration was 12 weeks. Based on emerging clinical data suggesting that subjects with HCV genotype 3 could benefit from extending the SOF+RBV treatment duration from 12 to 24 weeks, the protocol was amended. Subjects with genotype 2 HCV infection randomized to SOF+RBV treatment continued to received SOF+RBV for 12 weeks and subjects with genotype 3 HCV infection randomized to SOF+RBV treatment who had not completed treatment received SOF+RBV for 24 weeks. Subjects who had completed treatment at the time of the amendment completed follow-up visits as planned. Subjects randomized to the placebo group were terminated from the trial and offered open-label treatment through Study GS-US-334-0109 if they were eligible. Randomization was stratified by prior treatment experience (treatment-naive or treatment-experienced) and cirrhosis (presence or absence).</p><p>In total, 419 subjects received at least one dose of study drugs: 85 subjects in Group 1 (SOF+RBV 12 Weeks), 85 subjects in Group 2 (placebo) and 249 subjects in Group 3 (SOF+RBV 24 Weeks). At the time of safety update data cutoff date, 68.2% of subjects in Group 1 had completed study treatment. In Group 3, no subjects have completed study treatment or discontinued study treatment at the time of the safety update data cutoff date.</p><p>The mean exposure to study drug was 11.9 weeks for Group 1 (SOF+RBV 12 Weeks), 7.3 weeks for Group 2 (placebo), and 17.2 weeks for Group 3 (SOF+RBV 24 Weeks). There were no Grade 4 AEs reported in this trial up to the data cutoff date. Adverse events of anemia (3 subjects), fatigue (2 subjects), and hyperglycemia (2 subjects) were the only Grade 3 AEs reported in more than one subject in the trial. The Grade 3 AEs of arrhythmia, gastroenteritis, hyperglycemia, malignant hepatic neoplasm, road traffic accident, amylase increased, lipase increased, breast cancer, and colon cancer were </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comments</head><p>As per Applicant, the incidence of SAEs was higher in the SOF-compassionate-use protocols (43.6%) than across the rest of the sofosbuvir clinical development program.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-Gilead Sponsored Trials</head><p>The Applicant has provided safety data for 3 non-Gilead sponsored trials to support the safety of SOF in combination with other agents. These include: Study CO-US-334-0137, Study CO-US-334-0136, and Study CO-US-334-0112 from the interim abbreviated CSR provided by the NIAID (11-I-0258 CSR).</p><p>Of the 168 subjects in the Study CO-US-334-0137 (Janssen Study HPC2002) as of 01 April 2013, two subjects (1.2%) had died. One subject had a fatal trauma (accidental fall down stairs) and the other subject had a fatal ischemic stroke (The event occurred over one month after the last dose of study drugs in a 58 year old male subject. Polycythemia rubra vera was noted as a possible alternative explanation for the ischemic stroke in this case). Six subjects (3.6%) reported SAEs. No pregnancies were reported.</p><p>Of the 211 subjects in Study CO-US-334-0136 (BMS Study AI444040), 20 subjects (9.5%) reported SAEs through April 1, 2013. Only one SAE of accidental drug overdose was considered related to study treatment by the investigator. A mild headache was reported as being associated with the overdose. Two female subjects (0.9%) reported pregnancies. One 29-year-old subject was estimated to have conceived around the time of discontinuation of SOF, DCV, and RBV and delivered a healthy full-term infant. A 44year-old subject became pregnant approximately 6 months after discontinuing study drug but spontaneously aborted early in the pregnancy.</p><p>Of the 60 subjects in Study CO-US-334-0112 (NIAID Study 11-I-0258) as of April 1, 2013, one subject (1.7%) reported an SAE of acute pancreatitis. This event occurred more than four months after study treatment had been discontinued. One partner Clinical Review Poonam Mishra, MD NDA 204671 Sofosbuvir 166 subject travelled from US to Italy. Per subject report, he had a brief attack of shortness of breath, sweating, body aches, cold sensation and chills, then lost consciousness for 45 minutes. Doppler ultrasound of neck vessels revealed atherosclerosis. Echo was normal (ejection fraction of 65%). ECG revealed normal sinus rhythm with "eleven extra systoles and three ventricular with no significant breaks." The investigator reported causality as not related to study medications or procedures, but related to an unspecified pre-existing condition.</p><p>The Applicant concluded that "The overall safety profile for SOF in combination with other antiviral agents is consistent with the profile observed in the original NDA submission and, therefore, there are no new safety concerns for SOF based on the data presented in this safety update."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Comment</head><p>No new safety concerns associated with sofosbuvir use have been identified based on the review of the data provided in the 90 Day Safety Update Report.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.2">Labeling Recommendations</head><p>The proposed Package Insert (PI or label) is being reviewed by all disciplines. Labeling discussions are ongoing and the recommendations have not been finalized at the time of this review. Please refer to Cross Discipline Team Leader Memo by Dr. Sarah Connelly for detailed labeling recommendations. Some of the key recommendations under consideration by the clinical review team are outlined below:</p><p>• After in-depth discussions about the regulatory implications of proposed indication (for sofosbuvir use) -"in combination with other agents", the review team has decided to propose the use of sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin in subjects with genotype 2 or 3 HCV infection and sofosbuvir in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin in treatment-naïve subjects with genotype 1 or 4 HCV infection.</p><p>• Few subjects with genotype 5 (N=1) and genotype 6 (N=6) were included in the clinical trials. Discussions are ongoing whether available data on genotypes 5 and 6 is sufficient for dosing recommendations.</p><p>-Propose to include a statement in the Prescribing Information -Data on genotypes 5 and 6 are insufficient for dosing recommendations</p><p>• we believe an indication should specify the subpopulation studied which was patients with HCC meeting Milan criteria and awaiting liver transplantation.</p><p>-Discussions regarding how best to communicate the available information are ongoing. 6. Are there any other postmarketing studies/trials needed to further define the optimal use of sofosbuvir?</p><p>Please refer to the FDA background package for in depth discussion of these issues. Detailed information on the AC discussions and recommendations will be accessible via the official transcripts of the meeting. Do there appear to be the requisite number of adequate and well-controlled studies in the application?</p></div>
