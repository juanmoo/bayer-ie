<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Since Symbyax was approved in 2003, for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder, we have become aware of new safety information from analysis of data related to an increased risk of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and weight gain associated with olanzapine use. This information was not available when Symbyax was granted marketing authorization for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder. Therefore, we consider this information to be "new safety information" as defined in FDAAA.</p><p>In accordance with section 505-1 of FDCA, as one element of a REMS, FDA may require the development of a Medication Guide as provided for under 21 CFR Part 208. Pursuant to 21 CFR Part 208, FDA has determined that Symbyax poses a serious and significant public health concern requiring the distribution of a Medication Guide. The Medication Guide is necessary for patients' safe and effective use of Symbyax. FDA has determined that Symbyax is a product that has serious risks of which patients should be made aware because information concerning the risks could affect patients' decisions to use Symbyax. Under 21 CFR 208, you are responsible for ensuring that the Medication Guide is available for distribution to patients who are dispensed Symbyax.</p><p>You must revise and submit your Medication Guide to include the metabolic risks of Symbyax. Your proposed REMS must contain your revised Medication Guide and a timetable for submission of assessments of the REMS. The timetable for assessment of the REMS shall be no less frequent than 18 months, 3 years, and 7 years after the REMS is approved. Your assessment of the REMS should include an evaluation of: a. Patients' understanding of the serious risks of Symbyax b. A report on periodic assessments of the distribution and dispensing of the Medication Guide in accordance with 21 CFR 208.24 c. A report on failures to adhere to distribution and dispensing requirements, and corrective actions taken to address noncompliance</p><p>In accordance with section 505-1, you are required within 120 days of the date of this letter to amend your supplements with a REMS prior approval supplement containing your proposed REMS.</p><p>Use the following designator to prominently label all submissions, including supplements, relating to this REMS:</p><p>SUPPLEMENT FOR NDA 21-520 PROPOSED REMS <ref type="bibr">(b)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">(4)</ref> (b) (4) (b) <ref type="bibr">(4)</ref> 1.

Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug [see <ref type="bibr">Patient Counseling Information (17.5.)</ref>].</p><p>Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including olanzapine alone, as well as olanzapine taken concomitantly with fluoxetine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. While relative risk estimates are inconsistent, the association between atypical antipsychotics and increases in glucose levels appears to fall on a continuum and olanzapine appears to have a greater association than some other atypical antipsychotics.</p><p>Mean increases in blood glucose have been observed in patients treated (median exposure of 9.2 months) with olanzapine in phase 1 of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE). The mean increase of serum glucose (fasting and nonfasting samples) from baseline to the average of the 2 highest serum concentrations was 15.0 mg/dL.</p><p>In a study of healthy volunteers, subjects who received olanzapine (N=22) for 3 weeks had a mean increase compared to baseline in fasting blood glucose of 2.3 mg/dL.

The difference in mean changes between SYMBYAX and placebo was greater in patients with evidence of glucose dysregulation at baseline (including those patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus or related adverse reactions, patients treated with anti-diabetic agents, patients with a baseline random glucose level ≥200 mg/dL, or a baseline fasting glucose level ≥126 mg/dL). SYMBYAXtreated patients had a greater mean HbA 1c increase from baseline of 0.15% (median exposure 63 days), compared to a mean HbA 1c decrease of 0.04% in fluoxetine-treated subjects (median exposure 57 days) and a mean HbA 1c increase of 0.12% in olanzapine-treated patients (median exposure 56 days).</p><p>In an analysis of 6 controlled clinical studies, a larger proportion of SYMBYAX-treated subjects had glycosuria (4.4%) compared to placebo-treated subjects (1.4%).</p><p>The mean change in nonfasting glucose in patients exposed at least 48 weeks was 5.9 mg/dL (N=425). <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> shows short-term and long-term changes in random glucose levels from adult SYMBYAX studies. Controlled fasting glucose data is limited for SYMBYAX; however, in an analysis of 5 placebo-controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies with treatment duration up to 12 weeks, olanzapine was associated with a greater mean change in fasting glucose levels compared to placebo (2.76 mg/dL vs 0.17 mg/dL).</p><p>The mean change in fasting glucose for olanzapine-treated patients exposed at least 48 weeks was 4.2 mg/dL (N=487).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.9</head><p>Activation of Mania/Hypomania A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of Bipolar Disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a manic episode in patients at risk for Bipolar Disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described for clinical worsening and suicide risk represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for Bipolar Disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, Bipolar Disorder, and depression. It should be noted that SYMBYAX is approved for the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder.</p><p>In the 2 controlled bipolar depression studies there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of manic reactions (manic reaction or manic depressive reaction) between SYMBYAX-and placebo-treated patients. In 1 of the studies, the incidence of manic reactions was (7% <ref type="bibr">[3/43]</ref>) in SYMBYAX-treated patients compared to (3% <ref type="bibr">[5/184]</ref>) in placebo-treated patients. In the other study, the incidence of manic reactions was (2% [1/43]) in SYMBYAX-treated patients compared to <ref type="bibr">(8% [15/193]</ref>) in placebo-treated patients. This limited controlled trial experience of SYMBYAX in the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder makes it difficult to interpret these findings until additional data is obtained. Because of this and the cyclical nature of Bipolar I Disorder, patients should be monitored closely for the development of symptoms of mania/hypomania during treatment with SYMBYAX.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.10">Tardive Dyskinesia</head><p>A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.</p><p>The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses or may even arise after discontinuation of treatment.</p><p>There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.</p><p>The incidence of dyskinetic movement in SYMBYAX-treated patients was infrequent. The mean score on the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) in the SYMBYAX-controlled database across clinical studies involving SYMBYAX-treated patients decreased from baseline. Nonetheless, SYMBYAX should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of tardive dyskinesia. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on SYMBYAX, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with SYMBYAX despite the presence of the syndrome. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.</p></div>

This 733 and clinical anticonvulsant toxicity following initiation of concomitant fluoxetine treatment. 734 Alcohol -The coadministration of ethanol with SYMBYAX may potentiate sedation and orthostatic hypotension [see Drug 735 Interactions <ref type="bibr">(7.8)]</ref>. 736 Thioridazine -Thioridazine should not be administered with SYMBYAX or administered within a minimum of 5 weeks 737 after discontinuation of SYMBYAX. 738 In a study of 19 healthy male subjects, which included 6 slow and 13 rapid hydroxylators of debrisoquin, a single 25-mg oral 739 dose of thioridazine produced a 2.4-fold higher C max and a 4.5-fold higher AUC for thioridazine in the slow hydroxylators compared 740 with the rapid hydroxylators. The rate of debrisoquin hydroxylation is felt to depend on the level of CYP2D6 isozyme activity. Thus, 741 this study suggests that drugs that inhibit CYP2D6, such as certain SSRIs, including fluoxetine, will produce elevated plasma levels of 742 thioridazine [see Contraindications <ref type="bibr">(4)</ref>]. 743 Thioridazine administration produces a dose-related prolongation of the QT c interval, which is associated with serious 744 ventricular arrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes-type arrhythmias and sudden death. This risk is expected to increase with 745 fluoxetine-induced inhibition of thioridazine metabolism [see Contraindications <ref type="bibr">(4)</ref>]. 746 Due to the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death potentially associated with elevated thioridazine plasma 747 levels, thioridazine should not be administered with fluoxetine or within a minimum of five weeks after fluoxetine has been 748 discontinued [see Contraindications <ref type="bibr">(4)</ref>]. 749 Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) -Single doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of imipramine or its 750 active metabolite desipramine. 751 In two fluoxetine studies, previously stable plasma levels of imipramine and desipramine have increased &gt;2-to 10-fold when 752 fluoxetine has been administered in combination. This influence may persist for 3 weeks or longer after fluoxetine is discontinued. 753 Thus, the dose of TCA may need to be reduced and plasma TCA concentrations may need to be monitored temporarily when 754 SYMBYAX is coadministered or has been recently discontinued [see Clinical <ref type="bibr">Pharmacology (12.3)</ref>]. 755 Antihypertensive Agents -Because of the potential for olanzapine to induce hypotension, SYMBYAX may enhance the 756 effects of certain antihypertensive agents [see <ref type="bibr">Warnings and Precautions (5.11)</ref>]. 757 Levadopa and Dopamine Agonists -The olanzapine component of SYMBYAX may antagonize the effects of levodopa and 758 dopamine agonists. 759 Benzodiazepines -Multiple doses of olanzapine did not influence the pharmacokinetics of diazepam and its active 760 metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam. 761 When concurrently administered with fluoxetine, the half-life of diazepam may be prolonged in some patients [see Clinical 762 <ref type="bibr">Pharmacology (12.3)</ref>]. Coadministration of alprazolam and fluoxetine has resulted in increased alprazolam plasma concentrations and 763 in further psychomotor performance decrement due to increased alprazolam levels. 764 Clozapine -Elevation of blood levels of clozapine has been observed in patients receiving concomitant fluoxetine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>765</head><p>Haloperidol -Elevation of blood levels of haloperidol has been observed in patients receiving concomitant fluoxetine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>766</head><p>Phenytoin -Patients on stable doses of phenytoin have developed elevated plasma levels of phenytoin with clinical 767 phenytoin toxicity following initiation of concomitant fluoxetine. 768 Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 -In vitro studies utilizing human liver microsomes suggest that olanzapine has little 769 potential to inhibit CYP2D6. Thus, olanzapine is unlikely to cause clinically important drug interactions mediated by this enzyme. 770 Fluoxetine inhibits the activity of CYP2D6 and may make individuals with normal CYP2D6 metabolic activity resemble a 771 poor metabolizer. Coadministration of fluoxetine with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6, including certain antidepressants 772 (e.g., TCAs), antipsychotics (e.g., phenothiazines and most atypicals), and antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and others) 773 should be approached with caution. Therapy with medications that are predominantly metabolized by the CYP2D6 system and that 774 have a relatively narrow therapeutic index should be initiated at the low end of the dose range if a patient is receiving fluoxetine . 20 775 concurrently or has taken it in the previous five weeks. If fluoxetine is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a 776 drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need for a decreased dose of the original medication should be considered. Drugs with a narrow 777 therapeutic index represent the greatest concern (including but not limited to, flecainide, propafenone, vinblastine, and TCAs). 778 Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A -In vitro studies utilizing human liver microsomes suggest that olanzapine has little potential 779 to inhibit CYP3A. Thus, olanzapine is unlikely to cause clinically important drug interactions mediated by these enzymes. 780</p><p>In an in vivo interaction study involving the coadministration of fluoxetine with single doses of terfenadine (a CYP3A 781 substrate), no increase in plasma terfenadine concentrations occurred with concomitant fluoxetine. In addition, in vitro studies have 782 shown ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A activity, to be at least 100 times more potent than fluoxetine or norfluoxetine as an 783 inhibitor of the metabolism of several substrates for this enzyme, including astemizole, cisapride, and midazolam. These data indicate 784 that fluoxetine's extent of inhibition of CYP3A activity is not likely to be of clinical significance. 785 Effect of Olanzapine on Drugs Metabolized by Other CYP Enzymes -In vitro studies utilizing human liver microsomes 786 suggest that olanzapine has little potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Thus, olanzapine is unlikely to cause 787 clinically important drug interactions mediated by these enzymes. 788 Lithium -Multiple doses of olanzapine did not influence the pharmacokinetics of lithium.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>789</head><p>There have been reports of both increased and decreased lithium levels when lithium was used concomitantly with fluoxetine. 790 Cases of lithium toxicity and increased serotonergic effects have been reported. Lithium levels should be monitored in patients taking 791 SYMBYAX concomitantly with lithium. 792 Drugs Tightly Bound to Plasma Proteins -The in vitro binding of SYMBYAX to human plasma proteins is similar to the 793 individual components. The interaction between SYMBYAX and other highly protein-bound drugs has not been fully evaluated. 794 Because fluoxetine is tightly bound to plasma protein, the administration of fluoxetine to a patient taking another drug that is tightly 795 bound to protein (e.g., Coumadin, digitoxin) may cause a shift in plasma concentrations potentially resulting in an adverse effect. 796 Conversely, adverse effects may result from displacement of protein-bound fluoxetine by other tightly bound drugs [see Clinical 797 <ref type="bibr">Pharmacology (12.3)</ref>]. 798 Valproate -In vitro studies using human liver microsomes determined that olanzapine has little potential to inhibit the major 799 metabolic pathway, glucuronidation, of valproate. Further, valproate has little effect on the metabolism of olanzapine in vitro. Thus, a 800 clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction between olanzapine and valproate is unlikely. 801 Biperiden -Multiple doses of olanzapine did not influence the pharmacokinetics of biperiden.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>802</head><p>Theophylline -Multiple doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline or its metabolites. 805 Teratogenic effects -Pregnancy Category C 806 SYMBYAX -Embryo fetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits with olanzapine and fluoxetine in 807 low-dose and high-dose combinations. In rats, the doses were: 2 and 4 mg/kg/day (low-dose) [1 and 0.5 times the maximum 808 recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively], and 4 and 8 mg/kg/day (high-dose) [2 and 1 times the MRHD on 809 a mg/m 2 basis, respectively]. In rabbits, the doses were 4 and 4 mg/kg/day (low-dose) [4 and 1 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, 810 respectively], and 8 and 8 mg/kg/day (high-dose) [9 and 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively]. In these studies, 811 olanzapine and fluoxetine were also administered alone at the high-doses (4 and 8 mg/kg/day, respectively, in the rat; 8 and 812 8 mg/kg/day, respectively, in the rabbit). In the rabbit, there was no evidence of teratogenicity; however, the high-dose combination 813 produced decreases in fetal weight and retarded skeletal ossification in conjunction with maternal toxicity. Similarly, in the rat there 814 was no evidence of teratogenicity; however, a decrease in fetal weight was observed with the high-dose combination. 815 In a pre-and postnatal study conducted in rats, olanzapine and fluoxetine were administered during pregnancy and throughout 816 lactation in combination (low-dose: 2 and 4 mg/kg/day [1 and 0.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis], respectively, high-dose: 4 and 817 8 mg/kg/day [2 and 1 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis], respectively, and alone: 4 and 8 mg/kg/day [2 and 1 times the MRHD on a 818 mg/m 2 basis], respectively). Administration of the high-dose combination resulted in a marked elevation in offspring mortality and 819 growth retardation in comparison to the same doses of olanzapine and fluoxetine administered alone. These effects were not observed 820 with the low-dose combination; however, there were a few cases of testicular degeneration and atrophy, depletion of epididymal 821 sperm and infertility in the male progeny. The effects of the high-dose combination on postnatal endpoints could not be assessed due 822 to high progeny mortality. 823 There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with SYMBYAX in pregnant women.</p></div>

In a rat teratology study, 827 early resorptions and increased numbers of nonviable fetuses were observed at a dose of 18 mg/kg/day (9 times the MRHD on a 828 mg/m 2 basis). Gestation was prolonged at 10 mg/kg/day (5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). In a rabbit teratology study, fetal 829 toxicity (manifested as increased resorptions and decreased fetal weight) occurred at a maternally toxic dose of 30 mg/kg/day 830 (30 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug 831 should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 832 Placental transfer of olanzapine occurs in rat pups.</p><p>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>833</head><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled clinical studies with olanzapine in pregnant women. Seven pregnancies were 834 observed during premarketing clinical studies with olanzapine, including two resulting in normal births, one resulting in neonatal 835 death due to a cardiovascular defect, three therapeutic abortions, and one spontaneous abortion. 836 Fluoxetine -In oral embryo fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, there was no evidence of teratogenicity following 837 administration of up to 12.5 and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively (1.5 and 3.6 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively) throughout 838 organogenesis. However, in rat reproduction studies, an increase in stillborn pups, a decrease in pup weight, and an increase in pup 839 deaths during the first 7 days postpartum occurred following maternal exposure to 12 mg/kg/day (1.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 840 basis) during gestation or 7.5 mg/kg/day (0.9 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) during gestation and lactation. There was no 841 evidence of developmental neurotoxicity in the surviving offspring of rats treated with 12 mg/kg/day during gestation. The no-effect 842 dose for rat pup mortality was 5 mg/kg/day (0.6 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). 843 Treatment of Pregnant Women During the Third Trimester -Neonates exposed to fluoxetine, a component of SYMBYAX, 844 SNRIs, or SSRIs , late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, 845 and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory 846 distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, 847 hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of 848 SNRIs and SSRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is 849 consistent with serotonin syndrome [see <ref type="bibr">Dosage and Administration (2.3)</ref>, Contraindications <ref type="bibr">(4)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Warnings and Precautions (5.7)</ref>, 850 and Drug Interactions <ref type="bibr">(7.3)</ref>]. 851 Infants exposed to SSRIs in late pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn 852 (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1-2 per 1000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and 853 mortality. In a retrospective case-control study of 377 women whose infants were born with PPHN and 836 women whose infants 854 were born healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately six-fold higher for infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20th week 855 of gestation compared to infants who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. There is currently no corroborative 856 evidence regarding the risk for PPHN following exposure to SSRIs in pregnancy; this is the first study that has investigated the 857 potential risk. The study did not include enough cases with exposure to individual SSRIs to determine if all SSRIs posed similar levels 858 of PPHN risk. 859 When treating pregnant women with fluoxetine during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider both the 860 potential risks and benefits of treatment. Physicians should note that in a prospective longitudinal study of 201 women with a history 861 of major depression who were euthymic at the beginning of pregnancy, women who discontinued antidepressant medication during 862 pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continued antidepressant medication. The 863 physician may consider tapering fluoxetine in the third trimester. 864 8.2 Labor and Delivery 865 SYMBYAX -The effect of SYMBYAX on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. Parturition in rats was not affected by 866 SYMBYAX. SYMBYAX should be used during labor and delivery only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk. 867 Olanzapine -The effect of olanzapine on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. Parturition in rats was not affected by 868 olanzapine. 869</p><p>Fluoxetine -The effect of fluoxetine on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. Fluoxetine crosses the placenta; 870 therefore, there is a possibility that fluoxetine may be associated with adverse effects on the newborn. 871 8.3 Nursing Mothers 872 SYMBYAX -Studies evaluating the individual components of SYMBYAX (olanzapine and fluoxetine) in nursing mothers 873 are described below. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from SYMBYAX, a decision should be 874 made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. It is 875 recommended that women not breast-feed when receiving SYMBYAX. 876 Olanzapine -In a study in lactating, healthy women, olanzapine was excreted in breast milk. Mean infant dose at steady 877 state was estimated to be 1.8% of the maternal olanzapine dose. It is recommended that women receiving olanzapine should not 878 breast-feed. 879</p><p>Fluoxetine -Fluoxetine is excreted in human breast milk. In 1 breast milk sample, the concentration of fluoxetine plus 880 norfluoxetine was 70.4 ng per mL. The concentration in the mother's plasma was 295.0 ng per mL. No adverse effects on the infant 881 were reported. In another case, an infant nursed by a mother on fluoxetine developed crying, sleep disturbance, vomiting, and watery 882 stools. The infant's plasma drug levels were 340 ng per mL of fluoxetine and 208 ng per mL of norfluoxetine on the 2nd day of 883 feeding. 884 8.4</p><p>Pediatric Use 885 SYMBYAX -Safety and effectiveness in children and adolescent patients have not been established [see Boxed Warning 886 and Warnings and Precautions <ref type="bibr">(5.1)</ref>]. Anyone considering the use of SYMBYAX in a child or adolescent must balance the potential 887 risks with the clinical need. 888 Safety and effectiveness of olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination in children and adolescent patients have not been 889 established. 890</p><p>Fluoxetine -Significant toxicity, including myotoxicity, long-term neurobehavioral and reproductive toxicity, and impaired 891 bone development, has been observed following exposure of juvenile animals to fluoxetine.

In another study, a similar decrease in apparent clearance of olanzapine of 14% was observed following olanzapine doses of 6 or 12 mg with concomitant fluoxetine doses of 25 mg or more. The decrease in clearance reflects an increase in bioavailability. The terminal half-life is not affected, and therefore the time to reach steady state should not be altered. The overall steady-state plasma concentrations of olanzapine and fluoxetine when given as the combination in the therapeutic dose ranges were comparable with those typically attained with each of the monotherapies. The small change in olanzapine clearance, observed in both studies, likely reflects the inhibition of a minor metabolic pathway for olanzapine via CYP2D6 by fluoxetine, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, and was not deemed clinically significant. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of the individual components is expected to reasonably characterize the overall pharmacokinetics of the combination <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">.   058  059  060  061  062  063  064  065  066  067  068  069</ref> Absorption and Bioavailability SYMBYAX -Following a single oral 12-mg/50-mg dose of SYMBYAX, peak plasma concentrations of olanzapine and fluoxetine occur at approximately 4 and 6 hours, respectively. The effect of food on the absorption and bioavailability of SYMBYAX has not been evaluated. The bioavailability of olanzapine given as Zyprexa, and the bioavailability of fluoxetine given as Prozac were not affected by food.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="080">Metabolism and Elimination</head><p>Olanzapine -Olanzapine displays linear pharmacokinetics over the clinical dosing range. Its half-life ranges from 21 to 54 hours (5th to 95th percentile; mean of 30 hr), and apparent plasma clearance ranges from 12 to 47 L/hr (5th to 95th percentile; mean of 25 L/hr). Administration of olanzapine once daily leads to steady-state concentrations in about 1 week that are approximately twice the concentrations after single doses. Plasma concentrations, half-life, and clearance of olanzapine may vary between individuals on the basis of smoking status, gender, and age [see <ref type="bibr">Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)</ref>].</p><p>Following a single oral dose of 14 C-labeled olanzapine, 7% of the dose of olanzapine was recovered in the urine as unchanged drug, indicating that olanzapine is highly metabolized. Approximately 57% and 30% of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. In the plasma, olanzapine accounted for only 12% of the AUC for total radioactivity, indicating significant exposure to metabolites. After multiple dosing, the major circulating metabolites were the 10-N-glucuronide, present at steady state at 44% of the concentration of olanzapine, and 4´-N-desmethyl olanzapine, present at steady state at 31% of the concentration of olanzapine. Both metabolites lack pharmacological activity at the concentrations observed.</p><p>Direct glucuronidation and CYP450-mediated oxidation are the primary metabolic pathways for olanzapine. In vitro studies suggest that CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and the flavin-containing monooxygenase system are involved in olanzapine oxidation. CYP2D6-mediated oxidation appears to be a minor metabolic pathway in vivo, because the clearance of olanzapine is not reduced in subjects who are deficient in this enzyme.</p><p>Fluoxetine -Fluoxetine is a racemic mixture (50/50) of R-fluoxetine and S-fluoxetine enantiomers. In animal models, both enantiomers are specific and potent serotonin uptake inhibitors with essentially equivalent pharmacologic activity.

R-norfluoxetine is significantly less potent than the parent drug in the inhibition of serotonin uptake. The primary route of elimination appears to be hepatic metabolism to inactive metabolites excreted by the kidney. 139 subjects (≥65 years of age) than in non-elderly subjects (&lt;65 years of age). 140</p><p>The disposition of single doses of fluoxetine in healthy elderly subjects (&gt;65 years of age) did not differ significantly from 141 that in younger normal subjects. However, given the long half-life and nonlinear disposition of the drug, a single-dose study is not 142 adequate to rule out the possibility of altered pharmacokinetics in the elderly, particularly if they have systemic illness or are receiving 143 multiple drugs for concomitant diseases. The effects of age upon the metabolism of fluoxetine have been investigated in 260 elderly 144 but otherwise healthy depressed patients (≥60 years of age) who received 20 mg fluoxetine for 6 weeks. Combined fluoxetine plus 145 norfluoxetine plasma concentrations were 209.3 ± 85.7 ng per mL at the end of 6 weeks. No unusual age-associated pattern of adverse 146 reactions was observed in those elderly patients. 147 Renal Impairment -The pharmacokinetics of SYMBYAX has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. However, 148 olanzapine and fluoxetine individual pharmacokinetics do not differ significantly in patients with renal impairment. SYMBYAX 149 dosing adjustment based upon renal impairment is not routinely required. 150 Because olanzapine is highly metabolized before excretion and only 7% of the drug is excreted unchanged, renal dysfunction 151 alone is unlikely to have a major impact on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of olanzapine 152 were similar in patients with severe renal impairment and normal subjects, indicating that dosage adjustment based upon the degree of 153 renal impairment is not required. In addition, olanzapine is not removed by dialysis. The effect of renal impairment on olanzapine 154 metabolite elimination has not been studied. 155 In depressed patients on dialysis (N=12), fluoxetine administered as 20 mg once daily for 2 months produced steady-state 156 fluoxetine and norfluoxetine plasma concentrations comparable with those seen in patients with normal renal function. While the 157 possibility exists that renally excreted metabolites of fluoxetine may accumulate to higher levels in patients with severe renal 158 dysfunction, use of a lower or less frequent dose is not routinely necessary in renally impaired patients. 159 Hepatic Impairment -Based on the individual pharmacokinetic profiles of olanzapine and fluoxetine, the pharmacokinetics 160 of SYMBYAX may be altered in patients with hepatic impairment. The lowest starting dose should be considered for patients with 161 hepatic impairment [see <ref type="bibr">Dosage and Administration (2.3)</ref>and <ref type="bibr">Warnings and Precautions (5.18)</ref>]. 162 Although the presence of hepatic impairment may be expected to reduce the clearance of olanzapine, a study of the effect of 163 impaired liver function in subjects (N=6) with clinically significant cirrhosis (Childs-Pugh Classification A and B) revealed little 164 effect on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine. 165 As might be predicted from its primary site of metabolism, liver impairment can affect the elimination of fluoxetine. The 166 elimination half-life of fluoxetine was prolonged in a study of cirrhotic patients, with a mean of 7.6 days compared with the range of . 27 167 2 to 3 days seen in subjects without liver disease; norfluoxetine elimination was also delayed, with a mean duration of 12 days for 168 cirrhotic patients compared with the range of 7 to 9 days in normal subjects. 169 Gender -Clearance of olanzapine is approximately 30% lower in women than in men. There were, however, no apparent 170 differences between men and women in effectiveness or adverse effects. Dosage modifications based on gender should not be needed. 171 Smoking Status -Olanzapine clearance is about 40% higher in smokers than in nonsmokers, although dosage modifications 172 are not routinely required. 173 Race -No SYMBYAX pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. In vivo studies have shown 174 that exposures to olanzapine are similar among Japanese, Chinese and Caucasians, especially after normalization for body weight 175 differences. Dosage modifications for race, therefore, are not routinely required. 176 Combined Effects -The combined effects of age, smoking, and gender could lead to substantial pharmacokinetic differences 177 in populations. The clearance of olanzapine in young smoking males, for example, may be 3 times higher than that in elderly 178 nonsmoking females. SYMBYAX dosing modification may be necessary in patients who exhibit a combination of factors that may 179 result in slower metabolism of the olanzapine component [see <ref type="bibr">Dosage and Administration (2.3)</ref>]. 180 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 181 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility 182 No carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or fertility studies were conducted with SYMBYAX. The following data are based on 183 findings in studies performed with the individual components. 184 Carcinogenesis 185</p><p>Olanzapine -Oral carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. Olanzapine was administered to mice in 28 225 was prolonged and estrous was delayed at 1.1 mg/kg/day (0.6 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis); therefore, olanzapine may produce 226 a delay in ovulation. 227 Fluoxetine -Two fertility studies conducted in adult rats at doses of up to 7.5 and 12.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.9 and 228 1.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) indicated that fluoxetine had no adverse effects on fertility. However, adverse effects on 229 fertility were seen when juvenile rats were treated with fluoxetine at a high dose (30 mg/kg) associated with significant toxicity [see 230 <ref type="bibr">Use in Specific Populations (8.4)</ref> The primary rating instrument used to assess depressive symptoms in these studies was the Montgomery-Asberg Depression 239 Rating Scale (MADRS), a 10-item clinician-rated scale with total scores ranging from 0 to 60. The primary outcome measure of these 240 studies was the change from baseline to endpoint in the MADRS total score. In both studies, SYMBYAX was statistically 241 significantly superior to both olanzapine monotherapy and placebo in reduction of the MADRS total score. 242 14.2 Treatment Resistant Depression 243 The efficacy of SYMBYAX in acute treatment resistant depression was demonstrated with data from 3 clinical studies 244 (n=579). Doses evaluated in these studies ranged from 6 to 18 mg for olanzapine and 25 to 50 mg for fluoxetine. 245 An 8-week randomized, double-blind controlled study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of SYMBYAX in patients 246 (n=300) who met DSM-IV criteria for Major Depressive Disorder and did not respond to 2 antidepressants of adequate dose and 247 duration in their current episode. Patients who were not responding to an antidepressant in their current episode entered an 8-week 248 open-label fluoxetine lead-in; non-responders were randomized (1:1:1) to receive SYMBYAX, olanzapine, or fluoxetine, and were 249 treated for 8 weeks. SYMBYAX was flexibly dosed between 6/50 mg, 12/50 mg, and 18/50 mg. Results from this study yielded 250 statistically significant greater reduction in mean total MADRS scores from baseline to endpoint for SYMBYAX versus fluoxetine 251 and olanzapine. A second study with the same treatment-resistant patient population (n=28), when analyzed with change in MADRS 252 as the outcome measure, demonstrated statistically significantly greater reduction in MADRS scores for SYMBYAX versus fluoxetine 253 and olanzapine. A third study demonstrated statistically significantly greater reduction in total MADRS scores for SYMBYAX versus 254 fluoxetine or olanzapine alone, when analyzed in a subpopulation of depressed patients (n=251) who met the definition of treatment 255 resistance (patients who had not responded to 2 antidepressants of adequate dose and duration in the current episode  <ref type="bibr">Warnings and Precautions (5.7)</ref> and Drug 310 Interactions <ref type="bibr">(7.3)</ref>]. Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome or NMS-like reactions 311 that may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood 312 pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., 313 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Serotonin syndrome, in its most severe form can resemble neuroleptic malignant syndrome, in which the . 30 314 symptoms may include hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuation of vital signs, and mental 315 status changes. Patients should be cautioned to seek medical care immediately if they experience these symptoms. 316 17.9 Allergic Reactions and Rash 317 Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they develop a rash or hives [see <ref type="bibr">Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</ref>].</p><p>318 Patients should also be advised of the signs and symptoms associated with a severe allergic reaction, including swelling of the face, 319 eyes, or mouth, or have trouble breathing. Patients should be cautioned to seek medical care immediately if they experience these 320 symptoms. 321 17.10 Orthostatic Hypotension 322 Patients should be advised of the risk of orthostatic hypotension, especially during the period of initial dose titration and in 323 association with the use of concomitant drugs that may potentiate the orthostatic effect of olanzapine, e.g., diazepam or alcohol 324 <ref type="bibr">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)</ref> and Drug Interactions <ref type="bibr">(7.8, 7.9)</ref>]. Patients should be advised to change positions carefully to 325 help prevent orthostatic hypotension, and to lie down if they feel dizzy or faint, until they feel better. Patients should be advised to call 326 their doctor if they experience any of the following signs and symptoms associated with orthostatic hypotension: dizziness, fast or 327 slow heart beat, or fainting. 328 17.11 Abnormal Bleeding 329 Patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of SYMBYAX and NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that 330 affect coagulation since the combined use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and these agents have been 331 associated with an increased risk of bleeding [see <ref type="bibr">Warnings and Precautions (5.14)</ref>]. Patients should be advised to call their doctor if 332 they experience any increased or unusual bruising or bleeding while taking Symbyax. 333 17.12 Hyponatremia 334 Patients should be advised that hyponatremia has been reported during treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs, including 335 SYMBYAX. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, 336 weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. More severe and/or acute cases have been associated with hallucination, 337 syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death [see <ref type="bibr">Warnings and Precautions (5.15)</ref>]. 338 17.13 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment 339 As with any CNS-active drug, SYMBYAX has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. Patients should be 340 cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that SYMBYAX therapy 341 does not affect them adversely [see <ref type="bibr">Warnings and Precautions (5.16)</ref>]. 342 17.14 Body Temperature Regulation 343 Patients should be advised regarding appropriate care in avoiding overheating and dehydration. Patients should be advised to 344 call their doctor right away if they become severely ill and have some or all of these symptoms of dehydration: sweating too much or 345 not at all, dry mouth, feeling very hot, feeling thirsty, not able to produce urine [see <ref type="bibr">Warnings and Precautions (5.17)</ref>]. 346 17.15 Concomitant Medication 347 Patients should be advised to inform their physician if they are taking Prozac ® , Prozac Weekly™, Sarafem ® , fluoxetine, 348 Zyprexa ® , or Zyprexa ® Zydis ® . Patients should be advised to inform their physicians if they are taking, plan to take, or have stopped 349 taking any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, including herbal supplements, since there is a potential for interactions. Patients 350 should also be advised to inform their physicians if they plan to discontinue any medications they are taking while taking SYMBYAX, 351 as stopping a medication may also impact the overall blood level of SYMBYAX [see <ref type="bibr">Warnings and Precautions (5.20)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">(7.8, 7.9)</ref> </p></div>

SYMBYAX is not approved for use in patients less than 18 years old. You may not have any symptoms, so your doctor should do blood tests to check your cholesterol and triglyceride levels before you start taking SYMBYAX and during treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Increase in weight (weight gain):</head><p>Weight gain is very commonly seen in patients who take SYMBYAX. Teenagers (13-17 years old) who received olanzapine, one of the components of SYMBYAX, are more likely to gain weight and to gain more weight than adults. SYMBYAX is not approved for use in patients less than 18 years old. Some patients may gain a lot of weight while taking SYMBYAX, so you and your doctor should check your weight regularly. Talk to your doctor about ways to control weight gain, such as eating a healthy, balanced diet, and exercising.</p><p>What is SYMBYAX? SYMBYAX is a prescription medicine approved for use in adults: • for short-term treatment of episodes of depression that happen with Bipolar I Disorder.</p><p>• for short-term treatment of episodes of depression that do not respond to 2 other medicines, also called treatment resistant depression.</p><p>SYMBYAX contains two medicines, olanzapine and fluoxetine hydrochloride.</p><p>It is not known if olanzapine is safe and works in children under 18 years of age.</p><p>It is not known if olanzapine and fluoxetine hydrochloride taken together, or as SYMBYAX, is safe and works in children under 18 years of age.

Given the smaller sample size for fluoxetine compared to OFC and the lack of fluoxetine arms in the studies with the highest rates of serious depression events, it is difficult to assess the potential relationship to fluoxetine. There were no other statistically significant differences between OFC and other treatment groups with respect to rates of individual SAEs. There were no deaths among subjects in the clinical trials that were likely related to OFC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse Events Leading to Dropout</head><p>Most of the adverse events that led to discontinuation for OFC-treated patients were events that were common with OFC and olanzapine (weight gain, somnolence, sedation) or that were associated with the underlying disease (suicidal ideation). The only events 3 that led to discontinuation at a statistically significantly higher rate for OFC-treated patients than for another group were increased weight (2.1%) and sedation (1.3%). In general, rates of discontinuation due to adverse events, both overall and for individual events, were similar for OFC-and olanzapine-treated patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Clinical Sections of Labeling</head><p>The requirement for approval hinged on adequate analysis and presentation of safety information with updated data regarding changes in weight and serum glucose and lipid levels as confirmed by the Division and the Safety team. The principle changes in Symbyax labeling in PLR format are reflected in the following tables demonstrating that with increased exposure and over time, olanzapine use including when used with fluoxetine (as Symbyax), is associated with an elevated risk of weight gain, blood glucose and hyperlipidemia. Similarly, in adolescents, olanzapine use including when used with fluoxetine (as Symbyax) is associated with an elevated risk of weight gain, blood glucose and hyperlipidemia with increased exposure and over time. As there was no data available on fasting glucose levels with Symbyax administration, random glucose levels are presented in labeling demonstrating elevated risk of hyperglycemia that increases with time on olanzapine and fluoxetine. </p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(b) (4) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</formula><p>This is a representation of an electronic record that was signed electronically and this page is the manifestation of the electronic signature.

Background</head><p>In the Approvable Action Letter for NDA 21,520/S-012, olanzapine/fluoxetine combination (OFC) for treatment resistant depression (TRD) in adults, dated 28 March 2007. The agency requested that the sponsor address following issues before the application may be approved. Lilly included a plan of rolling submissions to provide additional hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and weight gain information. The rolling submissions regarding risks of weight gain, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia were reviewed by the safety team and Evelyn Mentari, MD is the primary medical reviewer. The detailed information regarding weight gain, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia associated with OFC can be found in her review. This review will address the remaining issues for regulatory processing.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall Study design</head><p>The proposed study, Study H6P-MC-HDAY (HDAY), consists of 4 periods: a screening phase (phase I), an week stabilization/maintenance phase (phase II), a -week double-blind, randomized withdrawal phase (phase III) Following a brief screening phase (phase I), approximately patients with TRD will enter Phase II, and receive open-label OFC for weeks. In order to move to the phase III, patients must have received OFC for a minimum of weeks and meet detailed response criteria for the last . In phase III, approximately patients will be randomly allocated to either receiving OFC or to receive fluoxetine alone in a for 27 weeks. Patients who relapse during this phase will be discontinued from the study. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">Figure 1</ref> illustrates the study design.</p></div>

Mean changes in glucose from baseline to endpoint for patients with normal glucose at baseline were statistically significantly higher for olanzapine than for haloperidol (5.06 mg/dL for olanzapine versus 1.28 mg/dL for haloperidol); mean changes overall were also statistically significantly higher (3.90 mg/dL versus -0.98 mg/dL).

A euglycemic glucose clamp as performed before and after three weeks of treatment. The stated purpose of the study was to determine if olanzapine had any adverse effects on metabolic parameters in non-diabetic subjects. The results for olanzapine versus placebo comparison will be discussed below.</p><p>The olanzapine group consisted of 17 males and 5 females. They were 91% Caucasian with mean age of 35 years. The placebo group consisted of 13 males and 6 females. They were 58% Caucasian with mean age of 32 years. Olanzapine was given at 2.5 mg per day for two days, 5 mg per day for 2 days and 10-mg per day thereafter for a total of three weeks. The study was performed in a metabolic unit. Patients were allowed up to three, 72 hour passes. The blinded period was preceded by 3-7 days of diet stabilization.</p><p>At baseline, approximate mean values for both groups were glucose 87 mg/dl, C peptide 1.6 ng/ml, and insulin 6-7 uU/ml. At endpoint, fasting blood glucose increased 2.3 mg/dl (P=0.028) in the olanzapine-treated group and increased 0.34 mg/dl (NS) in the placebo-treated group. C peptide rose 0.34 (P=0.002) in the olanzapine-treated group with no change in the placebo-treated group. Mean triglyceride level in the olanzapine-treated group was 88 mg/dl at baseline; triglycerides increased 26 mg/dl (P=0.006) post-treatment. Mean triglycerides at baseline were 119 mg/dl in the placebo group; triglycerides fell 4 mg/dl (NS) post-treatment. Mean body weight in both groups at baseline was approximately 70 kg. The mean weight change in the olanzapine-treated group was +1.95 kg (P&lt;0.001), compared with -0.22 kg (NS) in the placebo-treated group. Meal tolerance tests showed an increase in glucose AUC from baseline to endpoint (P=0.02) in the olanzapine group, which was statistically different (P=0.033) from the small decrease (NS) in the placebo group.</p></div>

Hyperglycemia: Summary</p><p>Mean increases in nonfasting glucose were statistically significantly greater for adult patients treated with olanzapine than for patients treated with placebo. Mean increases in fasting glucose were also higher for adult patients treated with olanzapine, but the differences were not statistically significant. Differences between olanzapine-treated subjects and placebo-treated subjects in glucose-related laboratory analytes were greater in subjects categorized as having baseline potential glucose dysregulation. In categorical analyses, patients with baseline borderline glucose levels, olanzapine-treated patients experienced a greater percentage in upward shift (high) of glucose levels compared with the placebo-treated patients. The incidence of treatment-emergent glycosuria was statistically significantly higher for olanzapine-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients.</p><p>Mean increases in glucose were generally greater in antipsychotic-naïve adults treated with OFC than in OFC-treated adults overall. Mean increases in glucose were generally greater in antipsychotic-naïve adolescents treated with olanzapine than in adolescents overall.</p><p>When comparing within-group changes in nonfasting glucose for OFC and olanzapine with within-group changes for olanzapine in the Olanzapine Adult Placebo-Controlled Database, the nonfasting glucose mean change is greater overall in the OFC Controlled database, and most pronounced in patients with baseline glucose elevations or with baseline potential glucose dysregulation. In categorical analyses of patients with normal baseline nonfasting glucose who developed borderline or high post-baseline values, higher proportions of OFC-treated patients experienced shifts upward compared with placebo-treated patients. Furthermore, among patients with borderline glucose at baseline, a higher percentage of OFC-treated patients than placebo-treated patients had an upward shift in glucose level (to "high").  <ref type="figure">------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</ref>--This is a representation of an electronic record that was signed electronically and this page is the manifestation of the electronic signature. <ref type="figure">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_15">---- /s/ --------------------- Evelyn K</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.0">BACKGROUND</head><p>Symbyax (olanzapine/fluoxetine) is currently approved for bipolar depression. This NDA seeks a claim for the short-term treatment of "treatment resistant depression (TRD)" in a dose range of 3/25 to 12/50 mg/day. There are, as yet, no drugs approved for the treatment of TRD. Although it is widely appreciated in the clinical community that a substantial fraction of patients with MDD do not respond adequately to available antidepressant treatments, there is not, to my knowledge, a widely accepted definition of TRD. In fact, Lilly modified its definition of this entity over the course of its development program. In its original pilot study (HGFR), patients must have failed 2 treatments in the current episode. However, in the next 2 studies (HGIE and HGHZ), patients needed only a history of failure on an antidepressant, along with failure in the current episode. When Lilly recognized that this more liberal approach to defining TRD was not succeeding, they went back to their original definition for the final 2 trials (HDAO 1 and 2).</p><p>The studies supporting this claim were conducted under IND 28,705. We had several meetings with Lilly over the course of this development program.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Overview of Studies Pertinent to Efficacy</head><p>The focus of our review was on 5 double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter, shortterm efficacy and safety trials involving the olanzapine/fluoxetine combination (OFC) in adult patients with "treatment resistant depression (TRD)." These studies were, in order of their conduct: HGFR; HGIE; HGHZ; HDAO-1; HDAO-2. All 5 studies compared OFC to each of olanzapine and fluoxetine alone. These studies ranged in duration from 8 to 12 weeks, and except for HGIE, were of flexible dose design <ref type="bibr">(6/25, 6/50, 12/25, 12/50, or 18/50)</ref>. Study HGIE was the only 12 week study; the others were all 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to endpoint in MADRS total score for all studies except for HGFR, where it was change from baseline to endpoint in HAMD-21 total score.</p><p>All of these studies required patients to meet criteria for MDD and to have failed to respond to adequate treatment with at least 2 antidepressants (i.e., adequate dose and duration). For all 5 studies, one of these failures had to be during a prospective 6-8 week lead-in phase on one of the following drugs: fluoxetine (HDAO and HGFR); venlafaxine (HGIE); nortriptyline (HGHZ). For 3 of these studies (HGFR; HDAO-1; HDAO-2), both of the failures had to be in the current episode of MDD.</p><p>Results of individual studies: -HGFR: This small pilot study failed to show superiority of OFC to fluoxetine and olanzapine on the primary endpoint of HAMD-21 (p=0.06 and 0.19, respectively), however it did show superiority of OFC to both individual arms on the MADRS.</p><p>-HGIE: This was the only fixed dose study, comparing 4 doses of OFC (6/25, 6/50, 12/25, 12/50) vs olanzapine alone, fluoxetine alone, and venlafaxine alone. All 4 OFC doses were superior to olanzapine (with no evidence for dose/response), but none was superior to fluoxetine or venlafaxine on the MADRS at the 12-week endpoint (however, both were comparisons were positive at 8 weeks). However, when the analysis was restricted to the subset of patients who failed on antidepressant treatment within the same episode (one failure by history and one prospective failure, i.e., the same criteria as those used in studies HGFR, and HDAO 1 &amp; 2, OFC was superior to both fluoxetine (p=0.021) and olanzapine (p=0.003) at 12 weeks. Dr. Chen does 4 depressive symptoms than the HAMD-21. Although not positive on the primary endpoint for the OFC vs fluoxetine comparison in the originally randomized sample, study HGIE was positive for this comparison for the subset of patients who met the stricter criteria for TRD. Although this is a post-hoc comparison, I think it is an eminently reasonable comparison. Thus, I consider these data, overall, to provide sufficient support for the efficacy of OFC in TRD (more conservatively defined) to justify the approval of this new claim. Dr. Chen, the statistical reviewer, is more circumspect in her views on this application, and considers HDAO-2 to be the only reliable source of evidence to support this new claim. She expresses reservations about accepting evidence from studies HGFR and HGIE as supportive. However, she does seem to concede that study HGIE, at least for the subgroup of interest, might be considered a source of support. We will request longer-term efficacy trials as a phase 4 commitment.</p></div>

The observed common adverse events profile seen in TRD patients was consistent with that seen in the other indications studied, as were the laboratory, vital signs, and ECG data, generally. However, there were findings regarding changes in weight, glucose and lipids, for both OFC and olanzapine alone, that are not adequately reflected in current Symbyax or Zyprexa labeling, and are not adequately addressed by the new changes proposed for this supplement.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.0">BACKGROUND</head><p>Symbyax® (olanzapine/fluoxetine combination or OFC) is approved for the treatment of bipolar depression. It is a combination of two psychotropic medications-olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, and fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Lilly is seeking approval for the indication of treatment resistant depression (TRD) with this application.</p><p>On 18 August 1999 DPP met with Lilly and agreed that TRD was a legitimate target for pharmacologic intervention. Furthermore, it was agreed that TRD could be reasonably defined as failure to respond to two trials of antidepressants (of adequate dose and duration) within the current depressive episode.</p><p>Lilly's first trials did not meet their primary efficacy endpoints, and so on 16 January 2002 we met with them and agreed that more studies would be required. We also agreed that according to FDA Guidance for Industry: Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biologic Products, we would require at least one positive study and additional supporting studies to satisfy the efficacy requirements for claim in TRD.</p><p>On 14 April 2005 we met for pre-NDA discussion and agreed that the overall content and format of the planned submission would support a priority review for TRD. The submission was received as this sNDA on 28 September 2006 and filed on 7 November 2006.</p><p>This sNDA has been reviewed by Jing Zhang, M.D., Medical Officer, DPP and Yeh-Fong Chen, Ph.D., Office of Biostatistics. Because this is an approved product, the most relevant reviews are clinical and statistical.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.1</head><p>Overview of Studies A total of 5 double-blind, active-controlled studies (1 pilot and 4 pivotal) were conducted from May 1997 to May 2005 to evaluate the efficacy of OFC in the treatment of TRD. The database included efficacy data from each individual study report and a summary of clinical efficacy. The safety database is made up of patients from studies of several different depressive-spectrum diagnoses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Definition of Treatment Resistant Depression</head><p>The definition of TRD is, of course, crucial in evaluating the efficacy of OFC in treatment-resistant patients. We have agreed with Lilly that treatment resistance is best defined as having failed two appropriately-dosed antidepressants (given for an adequate treatment period to expect response) during the current depressive episode. Studies HDAO 1 and 2, as well as study HGFR (pilot study, n=28) used this definition as an inclusion criterion, whereas HGIE and HGHZ, while requiring two treatment failures, did not by design require the two failures to occur during the current episode. For supportive evidence of the studies designed with the more conservative definition of TRD, the sponsor selected subsets of patients from studies HGIE and HGHZ who met the accepted definition of two antidepressant failures in the current episode and we reviewed those data (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_36">Table 1</ref> for inclusion criteria and <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> for summary of patients by study meeting the conservative definition of TRD).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.3">Primary Efficacy Endpoint</head><p>Either change in MADRS <ref type="bibr">(Study HDAO, HGIE and HGHZ)</ref> or change in HAM-D (Study HGFR) was used as the primary endpoint in the TRD studies reviewed in this submission.</p><p>Team Leader Comment: Both the MADRS and HAM-D are considered validated measures of efficacy for the evaluation of depression in clinical trials. Compared to the HAM-D, the MADRS is more heavily weighted with items that measure core mood symptoms of depression, as opposed to somatic and other non-core mood symptoms which are more heavily weighted in the HAM-D. Because olanzapine is sedating and appetite stimulating, it may improve sleep and appetite without changing the core symptoms of depression. Therefore, the MADRS should be the more accurate outcome measure in short-term studies that include olanzapine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.4">Study Design</head><p>All five studies shared a similar design: randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multi-center trials which compared OFC to olanzapine monotherapy and fluoxetine monotherapy in patients with TRD. All studies consisted of 3 phases: lead-in, acute treatment, and open-label.</p><p>Patients with a history of having failed drug treatment for depression received fluoxetine (HDAO and HGFR), venlafaxine (HGIE), or nortriptyline (HGHZ) treatment for 6-8 weeks during the leadin phase. Patients not responding to treatment during lead-in phase (TRD patients) were randomized to an 8-12 week acute treatment phase. A 1:1:1 ratio was used for treatment-group randomization to OFC, fluoxetine, and olanzapine in Study HDAO and HGFR. In Study HGHZ, a ratio of 1:1:1:0.5 was used for OFC, fluoxetine, olanzapine and nortriptyline treatment groups. Study HGIE was a dose ranging study with patients randomized to OFC 6/25, OFC 6/50, OFC 12/25, OFC 12/50, FLX, OLZ, VNL, and OFC 1/5 group. All studies except HGIE utilized flexible dosing designs (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">table 3</ref>). The acute treatment phase was followed by an open-label extension phase throughout which eligible patients received OFC for 8 weeks to 6 months depending on study design.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1">Summary of Studies Pertinent to Efficacy Claim</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HDAO-2</head><p>The mean change from baseline to endpoint on MADRS total score in Study HDAO-2 (LOCF) is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>. OFC-treated patients had a statistically significantly greater mean decrease in the MADRS total score (-14.62) than both fluoxetine-treated patients <ref type="bibr">(-8.96</ref>) and olanzapine-treated patients <ref type="bibr">(-7.71)</ref>. Patients treated with OFC had statistically significantly greater decreases on the MADRS total score than did the fluoxetine-treated patients at every week of the study, including endpoint; they also had statistically significantly greater decreases than did the olanzapine-treated patients at Week 1 and from Week 4 through endpoint (Week 8). The visit-wise OC analysis is consistent with these findings. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HGFR</head><p>The pre-specified primary outcome variable of Study HGFR was mean change from baseline to endpoint in HAMD-21 total score. The secondary variables were mean change from baseline to endpoint in MADRS total score and CGI-Severity scale. The study failed in the sense that OFC-5 treated patients did not show statistically significant decrease in HAMD-21 total score compared to fluoxetine (OFC vs. FLX p=0.061) or olanzapine (OFC vs. OLZ p=0.19) monotherapy. However, for both MADRS and CGI-Severity, OFC treatment demonstrated statistical superiority to fluoxetine monotherapy and to olanzapine monotherapy. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref> summarizes the results for these endpoints; visit-wise OC analysis of mean change from baseline to endpoint in MADRS was consistent with the findings from the LOCF analysis. Team Leader Comment: Although a small study, the more conservative definition of TRD was employed in patient selection and statistically significant separation from monotherapies was demonstrated using MADRS. I believe the MADRS to be the more appropriate clinical scale to measure the effect of olanzapine on the core symptoms of depression for the reasons cited in section 5.1.3 above. I consider this study to be supportive of the efficacy claim of OFC in TRD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HGIE</head><p>Study HGIE was a dose-ranging study. Four different OFC doses (6/25, 6/50, 12/25 and 12/50) were chosen to assess the efficacy of OFC as compared to olanzapine, fluoxetine and venlafaxine in the treatment of TRD measured by mean change from baseline to endpoint (12 weeks) in MADRS total score. The OFC 6/25, OFC 6/50, OFC 12/25, and OFC 12/50 treatment groups each had statistically significantly greater mean decreases in MADRS total score compared with the OLZ treatment group. However, none of the individual OFC treatment groups were statistically significantly different from the FLX or VNL treatment groups. Examination of the mean change from baseline in MADRS suggested no evidence of dose-response. The composite OFC treatment group (composite of OFC 6/25, 6/50, 12/25 and 12/50 group) had a statistically significantly greater mean decrease in MADRS total score from baseline to endpoint compared with the OLZ treatment group. However, the composite OFC treatment group was not statistically significantly different at endpoint from the FLX or VNL treatment groups.</p><p>Mean change in MADRS total score was also examined within the subset of patients with two drug treatment failures during their current episode of MDD (n = 251). In this subset, the composite OFC treatment group demonstrated a statistically significantly greater mean decrease in MADRS total score compared with both the FLX (p=0.021) and OLZ (p=0.003) treatment group at endpoint.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Team Leader Comment: Study HGIE was conducted earlier in the development of OFC for TRD;</head><p>at that time the definition of TRD included patients who had historically failed one antidepressant (not necessarily during the current depressive episode), and then failed to respond to the lead-in 6 treatment (second antidepressant). When the data are examined using the more conservative definition of having failed two drugs during the current episode, the results are more significant and more relevant to the proposed treatment population. Therefore, I would consider Study HGIE to be a positive supportive study based on change in MADRS in the subset of patients who failed two antidepressants in current depressive episode, even though the study failed to demonstrate an effect of OFC on MADRS total score in all patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HGHZ</head><p>The primary efficacy analysis in Study HGHZ was mean change from baseline to endpoint for MADRS total score. Using pair-wise comparisons, the OFC treatment group had a statistically significantly (p= .044) greater mean decrease at endpoint in MADRS total score compared with the OLZ treatment group. There were no statistically significant differences between the OFC and FLX treatment groups, or between the OFC and NRT treatment groups. Visit-wise analyses (LOCF) revealed that the OFC treatment group had a statistically significantly greater mean decrease in MADRS total score compared with the FLX treatment group at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The OFC treatment group had a statistically significantly greater mean decrease in MADRS total score compared with the OLZ treatment group at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8. <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref> summarizes mean change from baseline to endpoint in the primary efficacy measure (MADRS total score) for all patients during the acute phase (LOCF). Mean change in MADRS total score was also examined within the subset of patients with failure to respond to two treatment courses during their current depressive episode. The results were consistent with the findings from all patients (OFC vs. FLX: p= 0.106; OFC vs. OLZ p=0.007).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HDAO-1</head><p>This study was designed exactly as was HADO-2 (same protocol), but demonstrated no statistical separation of OFC from fluoxetine or olanzapine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Conclusions Regarding Efficacy Data</head><p>In summary, when the most medication-resistant subset of patients with depression (those having failed two drug therapies during the current depressive episode) is examined with the more proper measure of efficacy for a sedating and appetite-stimulating drug like olanzapine (MADRS), the analyses presented by the Sponsor support the efficacy claim of Symbyax® in the treatment of TRD.</p><p>The Sponsor has submitted one clearly positive pivotal study (HDAO-2) and two supportive studies (HGFR and HGIE) for the use of Symbyax® for the indication of TRD. These data taken together with FDA's Guidance for Industry: Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">7</ref> and Biological Product, Part II C section 2, provide sufficient evidence of efficacy in the treatment of TRD. The efficacy summary is presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 7</ref>. Source: Dr. Zhang's review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6.0</head><p>Safety Data</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Safety Findings from the Placebo-Controlled Trials</head><p>The controlled trial safety database for Symbyax® includes patients who participated in the doubleblind, acute phases of 10 controlled clinical depression trials of up to 12 weeks duration. These 10 clinical trials were conducted in patients with several forms of depression: treatment-resistant depression (5 studies), bipolar depression (2 studies), major depressive disorder (MDD) with psychotic features (2 studies), and MDD with sexual dysfunction (1 study).</p><p>In addition to controlled trial safety data, OFC has been marketed since January 2004 and its safety profile has been established. Dr. Zhang's safety review for this sNDA detected an increase in treatment-emergent hyperglycemia which is not well characterized in labeling, and we will need to address this issue prior to approval.</p><p>Team Leader Comment: The issue of olanzapine-induced hyperglycemia is addressed in labeling as a general warning applied to all atypical antipsychotics, but it is evident from the data presented as part of this OFC supplement (see below) that patients most vulnerable to this adverse event are those with borderline to high serum glucose pre-treatment. There is no specific warning against or contraindication to using olanzapine-containing products in patients with baseline impaired glucose regulation, although current labeling does instruct the prescriber to monitor for worsening of glucose control in such patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2">Safety Findings and Issues of Particular Interest</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2.1">Common and Drug-Related Adverse Events</head><p>OFC treated patients exhibited an overall AE rate of approximately 83%. This is minimally higher than placebo-treated patients (74%), but similar to olanzapine-treated (82.7%) and fluoxetinetreated (82.3%) patients.</p><p>The most frequently reported adverse events in the OFC treatment group (reported by ≥5% of OFCtreated patients) were: increased weight, increased appetite, dry mouth, somnolence, fatigue, headache, peripheral edema, tremor, dizziness, sedation, diarrhea, nausea, and anxiety. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">8</ref> There were no commonly reported events for which event rates were statistically significantly higher (after adjusted for exposure) for OFC than for olanzapine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2.2">Adverse Events Leading to Dropout</head><p>Most of the adverse events that led to discontinuation for OFC-treated patients were events that were common with OFC and olanzapine (weight gain, somnolence, sedation) or that were associated with the underlying disease (suicidal ideation). The only events that led to discontinuation at a statistically significantly higher rate for OFC-treated patients than for another group were increased weight (2.1%) and sedation (1.3%). In general, rates of discontinuation due to adverse events, both overall and for individual events, were similar for OFC-and olanzapine-treated patients. See page 28 of Dr. Zhang's review for details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2.3">Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) in Clinical Trials</head><p>Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported by 4.0% of OFC-treated, 2.8% of fluoxetine-treated, 3.4% of olanzapine-treated, and 5.9% of placebo-treated patients. SAEs that were reported by two or more of the 771 OFC-treated patients were depression <ref type="formula">(8)</ref>, suicidal ideation <ref type="formula">(6)</ref>, chest pain <ref type="formula">(2)</ref>, dyspnea <ref type="formula">(2)</ref>, and peripheral edema <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(2)</ref>. Depression was statistically significantly more common in OFC-treated than in fluoxetine-treated patients, but the majority of these events occurred in Studies HGGY and HGGA, which were studies in bipolar and psychotic depression and did not have fluoxetine treatment arms. Given the smaller sample size for fluoxetine compared to OFC and the lack of fluoxetine arms in the studies with the highest rates of serious depression events, it is difficult to assess the potential relationship to fluoxetine. There were no other statistically significant differences between OFC and other treatment groups with respect to rates of individual SAEs.</p><p>There were no deaths among subjects in the clinical trials that were likely related to OFC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2.4">Laboratory Findings</head><p>Statistically significant differences were seen between treatment groups for several laboratory measures. In general, the changes observed in OFC-treated patients were consistent with changes observed with its component monotherapies, particularly olanzapine. The most common treatmentemergent laboratory abnormalities seen OFC-treated patients included: high prolactin (incidence rate of OFC vs. PLA: 27.6% vs. 4.8%), low total bilirubin (15.3% vs. 3.9%), low bicarbonate (14.1% vs. 8.8%), high ALT (7.8% vs. 0.5%), high fasting glucose (7.1% vs. 0%), high hemoglobin A1c (5.9% vs. 0%), and high triglycerides (5.2% vs. 0%). Rates of abnormalities in OFC-treated patients were, in general, similar to or lower than rates seen in olanzapine-treated patients. In contrast, numerous abnormalities were seen at higher rates in OFC-treated than in fluoxetine-or placebo-treated patients; this suggest that OFC's laboratory profile is similar to that of olanzapine.</p><p>Abnormalities in Hepatic Laboratory Measures OFC-treated patients had statistically significantly greater mean change to maximum than placeboor fluoxetine-treated patients for AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase; they also had a statistically significantly greater change to maximum on alkaline phosphatase as compared to olanzapine-treated patients. This increase in alkaline phosphatase does not seem to be clinically significant and is similar to what was submitted in the original OFC safety package; there were no statistically significant differences in exposure-adjusted rates of hepatic-related adverse events between OFC and any of the other treatment groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abnormalities in Glucose and Lipids</head><p>Analyses of the exposure-adjusted incidence of patients with specified increases (taken from American Diabetes Association and National Cholesterol Education Program outlier criteria) in fasting and nonfasting glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides revealed no statistically significant differences between OFC and comparators in exposure-adjusted event rates for fasting glucose or for triglycerides. However, OFC-treated patients had statistically significantly higher rates of treatment-emergent increase in non-fasting glucose than placebo-treated patients. OFC-treated patients also had statistically significantly higher rates of treatment-emergent high cholesterol than both fluoxetine-and placebo-treated patients. OFC-treated patients also had higher rates of treatment-emergent high cholesterol than olanzapine-treated patients, although the differences were not statistically significant. See <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 8</ref> and page 36 of Dr. Zhang's review for more detail.  Treatment-emergent impaired glucose tolerance (defined as fasting serum glucose &lt;100 mg/dL at baseline and between100 and 126 mg/dL post-baseline) or potential diabetes (fasting serum glucose &lt;100 mg/dL at baseline and ≥126 mg/dL post-baseline) were not statistically significant between treatment groups, but the data presented are not adequately refined enough to determine clinical significance (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 9</ref>).  A statistically significantly higher proportion of OFC-treated patients had glycosuria (4.4%) than did fluoxetine-(0.4%) or placebo-treated (1.4%) patients; the proportion in OFC-treated patients was close to statistically significantly greater than that of olanzapine-treated patients (2.3%).</p><p>Team Leader Comment: The effects of OFC on glucose and lipids are related and similar to the effects seen with olanzapine. These are potentially important safety issues when using olanzapine or OFC and they have been identified as such in labeling. However, the effect of olanzapine on patients with borderline or high glucose prior to taking the drug has not been fully elucidated in labeling (see recommendations).</p><p>Because hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, and obesity are independent risk factors for heart attack and stroke, we should consider grouping these together in the Warnings/Precautions section of labeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2.5">ECG Findings</head><p>Statistically significant differences in mean change at endpoint in heart rate and QT interval were observed between OFC and other treatment groups. These changes were consistent with known safety profiles of the individual drugs that make up OFC. As an example, heart rate decreased for fluoxetine, increased for olanzapine, and decreased only slightly for OFC, resulting in statistically significant differences between OFC and both of its component monotherapies. QT prolongation (corrected by regression) in OFC treated patients was statistically significantly different from a shortening of the QT interval seen in olanzapine-and placebo-treated patients and a slightly prolonged QT seen in fluoxetine-treated patients. However, the placebo-adjusted mean change <ref type="bibr">(5.3 ms)</ref> in OFC treatment is not considered to be clinically significant.</p><p>The most common treatment-emergent ECG abnormalities in OFC-treated patients were rhythm abnormalities (8.3%), morphology abnormalities (6.2%), and T-wave abnormalities (5.9%). However, there were no statistically significant differences between OFC and any of the other treatment groups for any abnormality category. No SAEs or dropouts were due to ECG abnormalities in the integrated safety database.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2.5">Vital Signs Findings</head><p>Several statistically significant changes in vital signs were identified by Dr. Zhang, but the clinical significance of these changes is minimal.</p><p>With regard to statistically significant changes in supine and standing pulse, OFC-treated patients had small decreases, while fluoxetine-treated patients had larger decreases, and olanzapine-treated patients had increases, suggesting that any potential effect of OFC on pulse is intermediate to those of fluoxetine and olanzapine.</p><p>The incidence of potentially clinically significant changes in vital signs for OFC-treated patients was low (with no measure having incidence greater than 4%), with no statistically significant differences in exposure-adjusted event rates between OFC and any of the other treatment groups. No patient dropouts were attributed to abnormal vital signs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Changes in Weight</head><p>Sixteen percent of OFC-treated patients gained a clinically significant (≥10%) amount of weight compared to 0.7% of fluoxetine-treated patients, 14.6% of olanzapine-treated patients, and 0.2% of placebo-treated patients. Exposure-adjusted rates of potentially clinically significant weight gain were statistically significantly greater for OFC as compared to both fluoxetine and placebo, but not statistically different from olanzapine. Dropouts due to weight gain were 2.1% of OFC-treated patients and 1.7% of olanzapine-treated patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Team Leader Comment: Weight gain is a known adverse event with olanzapine and therefore OFC;</head><p>this is potentially clinically significant and has been addressed in labeling. The sponsor has revised their labeling so that this is in the Warnings/Precautions section and I agree with this increased prominence in labeling but would group it together with hypercholesterolemia and hyperglycemia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6.2</head><p>Conclusion Regarding Safety Short-term treatment with OFC appears to have been reasonably safe in the populations studied and there were no unexpected adverse events in normoglycemic patients. The majority of potentially clinically relevant adverse events are related to the olanzapine component of OFC. Primary among these is the high rate of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia in patients with borderline to high serum glucose pre-treatment, as well as hypercholesterolemia.</p></div>

The issue of how to most appropriately label for hyperglycemic patients will have to be addressed internally. We will need to request that the sponsor identify all olanzapine and OFC trial data wherein patients with impaired glucose tolerance were enrolled and glucose levels (preferably fasting) followed during treatment.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Summary of Clinical Findings</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.1">Brief Overview of Clinical Program</head><p>A total of 5 TRD studies were conducted from May 1997 to May 2005 to evaluate the efficacy of OFC in the treatment of TRD in adult population. All studies have a double-blind, multicenter, parallel, randomized study design to compare OFC to fluoxetine and olanzapine monotherapies.</p><p>The efficacy of OFC in the treatment of TRD in adult population is based on the efficacy data from one positive pivotal study, Study HDAO-2 and two supportive studies, Study HGFR and HGIE (based on a subset of patients who failed two antidepressants during current depressive episode).</p><p>The OFC safety evaluation in this sNDA is mainly based on an integrated safety database which included patients randomized in double-blind, acute treatment phase of 10 controlled OFC depression clinical trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.2">Efficacy</head><p>Results from Study HDAO-2 demonstrated that OFC treatment was statistically significantly more effective than olanzapine or fluoxetine monotherapy in reducing depressive symptoms in adult TRD population over the 8-week study as assessed by the primary variable of change from baseline on MADRS total score. Results from Study HGFR and Study HGIE (based on results from the subset of patients who failed two adequate antidepressant trials in current depressive episode) provided additional supportive evidence for OFC in treatment TRD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.3">Safety</head><p>The safety findings from an integrated safety database included patients who participated in the double-blind, acute phase of 10 controlled OFC depression trails, were consistent with the previously observed OFC safety profile.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.4">Dosing Regimen and Administration</head><p>All studies are flexible dosed studies except Study HGIE which is a dose ranging study. Patients randomized to OFC arms in Study HDAO, HGIE, and HGHZ received Symbyax once daily, dose ranged from 6/25 to 18/50 mg per day. Patients randomized to OFC arm in Study HGFR received olanzapine (5 to 20 mg/d) and fluoxetine (20 to 60 mg/d) separately. A mandatory dose titration for the non-responding patients who had no dose-limiting side effects from OFC was incorporated into the protocol to facilitate the chance for optimal dosing. All study drugs were administered orally.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Product Information</head><p>Symbyax is a combination of two psychiatric agents-olanzapine, an antipsychotic of the thienobenzodiazepine class and fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Symbyax was approved by FDA for bipolar depression in December 2003.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Currently Available Treatment for Indications</head><p>No drugs or drug combinations are approved by FDA for the indication of TRD in the United States.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Availability of Proposed Active Ingredient in the United States</head><p>Two active ingredients of Symbyax, olanzapine and fluoxetine, are approved drugs in the United State.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Important Issues With Pharmacologically Related Products</head><p>The safety concerns regarding to agranulocytosis, metabolic syndrome with atypical antipsychotic treatment, and primary pulmonary hypertension of the newborn with SSRI treatment from post marketing data are under review by our safety team. At this point no any final conclusions regarding to these issues have been reached. No any cases of agranulocytosis, or liver failure were reported in TRD studies. A total of 8 pregnant women were included in the controlled-placebo OFC studies and 4 of them have reached full term. No birth-related abnormalities or primary pulmonary hypertension were reported (see 7.1.14 Human Reproduction and Pregnancy Data). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Presubmission Regulatory Activity</head><p>On August 18, 1999, the FDA met with Lilly and agreed with Lilly that TRD was a reasonable target for new indication. The FDA also agreed with Lilly's definition of TRD as the failure to respond to trials with two different classes of antidepressant therapy of adequate duration and dose.</p><p>On January 16, 2002, the FDA met with Lilly and stated that because studies HGIE, HGHZ, and HGFR did not meet their primary endpoints, two additional positive studies would be required for an indication of TRD.</p><p>On April, 14, 2005, Lilly had a pre-NDA meeting with FDA, at which the FDA agreed that the overall content and format for submission of clinical trail data to support an indication of TRD for Symbyax. In addition, FDA agreed that submission would warrant a Priority Review, and that it would likely go to an Advisory Committee.</p><p>On December 21, 2005, Lilly had a pre-submission teleconference with FDA, at which the FDA agreed that TRD application was filable and that a rolling submission was acceptable.</p><p>On April 24, 2006, the FDA responded in an e-mail correspondence in response to an e-mail correspondence sent by Lilly on April 21, 2006 regarding to additional pre-submission questions related to the TRD submission. In summary, FDA agreed with Lilly's proposed safety analyses and plan to submit labeling for the co-administration of Zyprexa and Prozac for an indication of TRD.</p><p>On September 28, 2006, this sNDA was submitted. It was judged to be fileable on November 7, 2006.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Other Relevant Background Information</head><p>Symbyax was approved for marketing only in USA and Symbyax has not been withdrawn from the market for any reason.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">CMC (and Product Microbiology, if Applicable)</head><p>Environmental assessment was previously submitted by Lilly for both olanzapine (NDA20592, 21 September, 1995) and fluoxetine <ref type="bibr">(NDA 20187, 6 August, 1993)</ref>. In these assessments, it was concluded that given their projected use rates, neither of these compounds posed a threat to the aquatic environment.</p><p>Lilly claim that even with the addition of the TRD indication, the conclusion from previous assessment does not changed. Therefore, Lilly claims a categorical exclusion from the need to Clinical Review Jing Zhang, MD. PhD.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Statistical Review and Evaluation</head><p>Yeh-Fong Chen, PhD., is the statistical reviewer for this sNDA. Up to the time of completion of this review, her review is still pending.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">DSI Clinical Site Inspection</head><p>The Division of Scientific Investigations (DSI) inspected 2 sites, and Dr. Richard Bergeron and Dr. Louise Beckett were the principle investigators. These two sites were selected due to larger enrollment in two positive studies-Study HDAO-2 and Study HGIE. The inspection of Dr. Bergeron revealed no significant problems that would adversely impact data acceptability. The inspection of Dr. Beckett revealed problems with the informed consent procedures, a protocol deviation, inadequate records, and inadequate drug accountability record keeping. However, in general these deviations do not adversely impact data acceptability. In summary, DSI concluded that data from these two investigators are acceptable to support of this submission.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Indication</head><p>This submission is for the use of Symbyax (or OFC) for an indication of treatment resistant depression (TRD).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.1">Methods</head><p>A total of 5 double-blind, active-controlled studies (1 pilot and 4 pivotal) have been conducted from May 1997 to May 2005 to evaluate the efficacy of OFC in the treatment of TRD. The data from all 5 studies were reviewed. The database reviewed included efficacy data from each individual study report and the summary of clinical efficacy of each individual study. The efficacy review was performed in consultation with the statistical reviewer, Yeh-Fong Chen PhD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2">General Discussion of Endpoints</head><p>Either MADRS (Study HDAO, HGIE and HGHZ) or HAM-D (Study HGFR) was used as primary endpoint in the TRD studies reviewed in this submission. Both MADRS and HAM-D were considered acceptable measures for evaluation of depression in clinical trials. Compared to the HAM-D, the MADRS is more heavily weighted on items that measure core mood symptoms of depression, as opposed to somatic and other non-core mood symptoms. Because olanzapine tends to improve patient's sleep and appetite-symptom improvements that may be detected most easily on the HAM-D-using the MADRS as the primary analysis measure in studies that include olanzapine helps to differentiate direct effects on mood from effects on sleep and appetite. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> summarized the primary and secondary endpoints in each individual study.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_17">• Mean ∆ in BPRS • Mean ∆ in MADRS • Mean ∆ in CGI- Severity • Mean ∆ in HAM-A • Mean ∆ in CGI- Severity • Total ∆ in HAM-A • Total ∆ in BPRS • Mean ∆ in CGI- Severity • Mean ∆ in HAM- A • Total ∆ in BPRS</formula><p>MADRS: the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale HAM-A: the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety CGI-Severity: the Clinical Global Impression-Severity of illness BPRS: the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.3">Study Design</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.3.1">Investigators/Sites</head><p>Study HDAO-1 and Study HGFR were conducted in the United States. Study HDAO-2, HGIE and HGHZ were conducted in more than one country including USA. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> summarized the investigators and study sites in each study. A full list of clinical study sites and investigators for Study HDAO-2, HGFR and HGIE is included in Appendices 10.1. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.3.2">Objectives</head><p>The primary objective of all five studies was to assess the efficacy of OFC versus fluoxetine and olanzapine monotherapy in the treatment of TRD. In addition, Study HGIE and Study HGHZ Clinical Review Jing Zhang, MD. PhD. Supplemental NDA 21520/SE1-012 Symbyax® 12 also assessed the efficacy of OFC versus Venlafaxine (HGIE) and Nortriptyline (HGHZ) monotherapy in the treatment of TRD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.3.3">Subjects</head><p>Inclusion criteria: Eligible patients for TRD studies were male or female, 18 or older, met DSM-IV criteria for MDD without psychotic features, historical failure to achieve satisfactory antidepressant response when treated with an acceptable antidepressant and reasonable dose for at least 4 weeks and prospectively failure to another antidepressant drug during a 6-8 week lead-in phase. The key inclusion criteria for each individual study were summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>.4 Overall Study design</head><p>All five studies had similar design---a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter design to compare OFC to olanzapine and fluoxetine monotherapies (Study HGIE also comparing to venlafaxine monotherapy and Study HGHZ also comparing to nortriptyline monotherapy) in patients with TRD. Study HDAO-1 and 2 have exactly same protocol. All studies consisted of 3 phases-Lead-in phase, acute treatment phase and open-label phase.</p><p>Patients who met the inclusion criteria received fluoxetine (HDAO and HGFR), venlafaxine (HGIE) or nortriptyline (HGHZ) treatment for 6-8 weeks in lead-in phase. Patients who did not respond to above treatments during lead-in phase and who were not ineligible by interim exclusion criteria (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref> for the criteria) were randomized to an 8-12 week acute treatment phase. A 1:1:1 ratio was used for treatment-group randomization to OFC, fluoxetine, olanzapine in Study HDAO and HGFR. In Study HGHZ, a ratio of 1:1:1:0.5 was use to OFC, fluoxetine, olanzapine and nortriptyline treatment groups. Study HGIE was a dose ranging study. Equal numbers of patients were randomized into OFC 6/25, OFC 6/50, OFC 12/25, OFC 12/50, FLX, OLZ, VNL, and OFC 1/5 group.</p><p>Acute treatment phase was followed by an open-label extension phase throughout which eligible patients received OFC for 8 weeks to 6 months depending on study design. The results of openlabel phase will be analyzed separately and were not included in this submission.</p><p>The major features of each individual study design were summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.3.5">Dose and Administration</head><p>All TRD studies were flexible dose studies except Study HGIE which was a dose ranging study. The detail dose information is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 7</ref>. All study drugs were administered orally. Since a clear dose response for OFC has not yet been established, a mandatory dose titration (except HGIE which is a dose ranging study) for the non-responding patients who had no doselimiting side effects from OFC was incorporated into the protocol to facilitate the chance for optimal dosing. The patients who couldn't tolerate the minimum required doses of study drugs were removed from the studies. Same dose titration principle also applied to lead-in phase. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.3.6">Statistical Analysis Plan</head><p>All data from the studies were analyzed on an intent to treat (ITT) basis. An ITT analysis is an analysis of data by groups to which the patients were assigned by random allocation, even if the patient did not take the assigned treatment, did not receive the correct treatment, or otherwise did not follow the protocol. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) models were used to evaluate continuous data, and Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate most categorical data except Study HGIE. In HGIE, Chi square test was used for categorical data. For continuous measures, lastobservation-carried-forward (LOCF) methodology was used to assess mean change (unless otherwise specified). When LOCF mean change from baseline to endpoint was assessed, patients were included in the analysis only if the patient had a baseline and a post-baseline measure. All comparisons between treatment groups were made using a two-sided significance level of 0.05.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.4">Efficacy Findings</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.4.1">Demographic Characteristics</head><p>Demographic Characteristics in Acute Phase at baseline were summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 8</ref> by studies.  The demographic profiles of all studies were very similar and were roughly balanced across treatment groups in each individual study. Females constituted about 2/3 of the ITT population in all 5 studies. The mean ages were closely matched among all studies ranged from 41.68 to 45.69. Most of the population of all studies was Caucasian, from 88% to 96% in all studies except Study HDAO-1 in which Caucasian population (82%) was slightly lower.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.4.2">Disease Characteristics</head><p>The baseline disease characteristics in acute treatment phase were summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 9</ref>.  The populations of all studies were similar with respect to severity of their depression measured by MADRS and CGI-Severity and there was no significant difference among treatment groups in each individual study. Most patients in all studies were moderately to severely depressed, with mean MADRS total scores of approximately 29 to 30 points and CGI-Severity total score ~4.4 to 4.7 points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.4.3">Concomitant Medications</head><p>The allowed concomitant medications in TRD studies included lorazepam (up to 4 mg/week), simple analgesics, and vitamins.  Deviations from the protocol list of excluded medications were recorded from a small number of patients. One patient in Study HDAO-1 (quetiapine), 1 in HDAO-2 (quetiapine), 1 in Study HDFR, 5 in Study HGIE (included 2 on quetiapine) and 1 in Study HGHZ were found taking antidepressants during acute treatment phase of the studies. The dose and duration of antidepressant use was unclear. Since the violations only involved in a very small number of patients, it is very unlikely that these violations would affect the efficacy results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.4.4">Disposition of Patients</head><p>Patient disposition was summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_36">Table 11</ref> by studies. In each individual study, roughly equal numbers of patients who were eligible for double-blind acute treatment phase were randomized to each treatment group except in Study HGHZ in which nortriptyline group was consisted of only about half amount of patients compared with other treatment groups. The overall completion rate cross all studies was similar, ranged from 73% to 81%. Olanzapine treated groups were associated with lowest completion rate (61% to 77%), followed by OFC treated groups (72% to 80%) except in Study HGFR. In HGFR, fluoxetine treated group had lowest completion rate (70%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.4.5">Discontinuation</head><p>Primary reasons for discontinuation in acute treatment phase were summarized by studies and treatment groups in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 12</ref>. The most common reason for discontinuation among all studies was "adverse events", followed by "lack of efficacy", "lost to follow up" and "personal conflict". Olanzapine and OFC treatments were associated with higher discontinuation rate caused by adverse events.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary variable: MADRS total score change from baseline to end point</head><p>The primary variable of this study was to assess the antidepressant efficacy of OFC versus olanzapine and fluoxetine up to 8 weeks in patients with TRD as measured by LOCF mean change from baseline to endpoint in the MADRS total score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HDAO-1</head><p>The mean change from baseline to endpoint on MADRS total score in Study HDAO-1 (LOCF) was shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 13</ref>. As shown in the table, OFC did not statistically separate from fluoxetine or olanzapine monotherapy. The result from visit-wise OC analysis on mean change from baseline to endpoint on MADRS total score was consistent with the result from LOCF (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table  34</ref> in Appendices 10.2). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HDAO-2</head><p>The mean change from baseline to endpoint on MADRS total score in Study HDAO-2 (LOCF) was shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 14</ref>. OFC-treated patients had a statistically significantly greater mean decrease in the MADRS total score (-14.62) than both fluoxetine-treated patients <ref type="bibr">(-8.96</ref>) and olanzapine-treated patients <ref type="bibr">(-7.71)</ref>. Patients treated with OFC had statistically significantly greater decreases on the MADRS total score than did the fluoxetine-treated patients at every week of the study, including endpoint, and had statistically significantly greater decreases than did olanzapine-treated patients at Week 1 and from Week 4 through endpoint (Week 8). The Clinical Review Jing Zhang, MD. PhD. Supplemental NDA 21520/SE1-012 Symbyax® 20 visitwise OC analysis further confirmed the findings from LOCF analysis. Patients treated with OFC had statistically significant decrease on the MADRS than did the fluoxetine treated patients at every week of the study and had statistically significant decrease on the MADRS than did the olanzapine treated patients at week 1 and from week 6 to endpoint (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 35</ref> in Appendices 10.2). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-Key Secondary variables: CGI-Severity scale and Remission Rates Based on MADRS Total Scores</head><p>Since HDAO-1 failed its primary and secondary variables, the efficacy data from secondary variables will not be presented in this review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CGI-Severity Scale</head><p>The mean change from baseline to endpoint in CGI-Severity (LOCF) is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 15</ref>. OFC-treated patients had statistically significantly greater decreases in CGI-Severity scale than did fluoxetine-or olanzapine-treated patients at endpoint <ref type="bibr">(8 weeks)</ref> in acute treatment phase. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remission rates based on MADRS total scores</head><p>The incidence of and time to two types of remission were analyzed: remission (defined as having an endpoint MADRS total score ≤ 10) and sustained remission (defined as having at least two consecutive MADRS total scores ≤ 10, including the endpoint visit). Statistically significantly higher proportions of OFC-treated patients exhibited remission at endpoint compared with both fluoxetine-treated and olanzapine-treated patients (31% versus 16% and 11%, respectively), and the time-to-remission curves were statistically significantly different overall, with OFC-treated patients achieving remission statistically significantly earlier than both fluoxetine-treated and olanzapine-treated patients. Similarly, A statistically significantly higher proportion of OFCtreated patients exhibited sustained remission at endpoint compared with both fluoxetinetreated and olanzapine-treated patients (26% versus 12% and 9%, respectively), and the time-to-sustained remission curves were statistically significantly different overall, with OFC-treated patients achieving sustained remission statistically significantly earlier than both fluoxetine-treated and olanzapine-treated patients.</p><p>Incidence of remission for acute treatment phase in HDAO-2 is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 16</ref>. The primary variable of Study HGFR was mean change from baseline to endpoint in HAMD-21 total score. The non-key secondary variables were mean change from baseline to endpoint in MADRS total score and CGI-Severity scale. The study failed its primary variable: OFC treated patients did not show statistically significant decrease in HAMD-21 total score than did fluoxetine (OFC vs. FLX p=0.061) and olanzapine (OFV vs. OLZ p=0.19) monotherapy. But in both MADRS and CGI-Severity, OFC treatment showed statistical superiority to fluoxetine and olanzapine monotherapies.  As discussed in 6.1.2 General Discussion of Endpoint, both HAMD and MADRS are wellvalidated and standard tools to assess improvement of depression. However, using MADRS as the primary analysis measure in studies that include olanzapine helps to differentiate direct effects on mood from effects on sleep and appetite. HGFR was the first TRD study and was the only TRD study that uses HAMD as the primary measure for evaluation of depression. In the rest of TRD studies, MADRS was used as the primary variable. Therefore, I would consider Study HGFR as a positive supportive study based on its positive findings in MADRS even though the study failed it primary variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.4.6.3">Study HGIE</head><p>Study HGIE was a dose-ranging study. Four different OFC doses <ref type="bibr">(6/25, 6/50, 12/25 and 12/50)</ref> were chosen to assess the efficacy of OFC against olanzapine, fluoxetine and venlafaxine in the treatment of TRD measured by mean change from baseline to endpoint (12 weeks) in MADRS total score. The OFC 6/25, OFC 6/50, OFC 12/25, and OFC 12/50 treatment groups each had statistically significantly greater mean decreases in MADRS total score compared with the OLZ treatment group. However, none of the individual OFC treatment groups were statistically significantly different from the FLX or VNL treatment groups. Examination of the mean change from baseline in MADRS suggested no evidence of dose-response. The composite OFC treatment group (composite of OFC 6/25, 6/50, 12/25 and 12/50 group) had a statistically significantly greater mean decrease in MADRS total score from baseline to endpoint compared with the OLZ treatment group.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>A total of 5 double-blind, placebo-controlled TRD clinical studies were conducted by Lilly. Only one study (HDAO-2) had clearly positive results on both primary and secondary variables. In Study HGFR, HAMD-21 was the pre-specified primary and the study failed HAMD-21. However, Study HGFR had positive results on MADRS (OFC separated from FLX and OLZ). In study HGIE, OFC showed statistically significantly greater reduction on the MADRD than both FLX and OLZ after 8 weeks of treatment. However the difference over FLX was only numerically superior after 12 weeks of treatment and the 12 week study is the pre-specified study design. If the more restrictive inclusion criteria (failed two antidepressants in current episode) were applied to Study HGIE, OFC was statistically superior to FLX and OLZ monotherapies at the end of 12 weeks. In Study HGHZ, OFC treatment is only superior to OLZ at the end of 8 Efficacy summary for acute treatment phase in patients with two antidepressant failures in current depressive episode by studies was presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 20</ref>. In summary, there are one positive pivotal study (HDAO-2) and two supportive studies (HGFR and HGIE) supporting the use of Symbyax for TRD indication. Based on FDA Guidance for Industry: Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Product, Part II C section 2, these data are felt to provide sufficient evidence of efficacy in treatment of TRD.</p></div>

These 10 clinical trials (represented by 7 clinical protocols, 3 of which involved 2 identical studies conducted under a single protocol) were conducted in patients with several forms of depression: treatment-resistant depression (5 studies), bipolar depression (2 studies), major depressive disorder (MDD) with psychotic features (2 studies), and MDD with sexual dysfunction (1 study). <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 21</ref> summarizes studies that were included in the integrated safety database. Double-blind, multicenter, parallel, randomized, fluoxetine-controlled studies of premenopausal women experiencing sexual dysfunction while receiving fluoxetine treatment.</p><p>Since marketing of OFC began in January 2004, its safety profile has been well established. The safety review from this submission did not detect any unexpected serious adverse events and the patterns of common adverse events of OFC remained same as its current labeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.1">Deaths</head><p>There were 4 deaths reported in the OFC integrated safety database-one from OFC-and 3 from placebo-treated groups. None of the deaths were considered to be related to study drug or study procedures by investigators:</p><p>• Patient HGIE-641-7451 (randomized to OFC 12/25) died from an accidental gunshot wound incurred during a hunting accident. • Patient HGGY-010-0326 (randomized to placebo) died after a stabbing incident; autopsy results gave the cause of death as blunt force trauma to the head and chest. • Patient HGGY-403-4051 (randomized to placebo) committed suicide by hanging.</p><p>• Patient HGGY-702-7029 (randomized to placebo) committed suicide by drowning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.2">Other Serious Adverse Events</head><p>Serious adverse events (SAEs) were experienced by 4.0% of OFC-treated, 2.8% of fluoxetinetreated, 3.4% of olanzapine-treated, and 5.9% of placebo-treated patients. The only SAEs that were reported by 2 or more of the 771 OFC-treated patients were depression (8 patients), suicidal ideation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(6)</ref>, chest pain (2), dyspnea <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(2)</ref>, and peripheral edema <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(2)</ref>. The SAE of depression was statistically significantly more common in OFC-treated than in fluoxetine-treated patients. The majority of these depression events occurred in Studies HGGY and HGGA, which were studies in bipolar and psychotic depression, respectively, and did not have fluoxetine treatment arms. Given the smaller sample size for fluoxetine compared to OFC and the lack of fluoxetine arms in the studies with the highest rates of serious depression events, it is difficult to assess the potential relationship to fluoxetine. There were no other statistically significant differences between OFC and other treatment groups with respect to rates of individual SAEs. Clinical Review Jing Zhang, MD. PhD.

Two completed suicides occurred within placebo-treated patients in the double-blind phase. No "possible suicidal behaviors (completed suicides, suicide attempts or self-injurious behaviors)" were observed in OFC-treated patients, but were observed in the placebo-treated group. A statistically significantly greater incidence of suicidal ideation events (measured by suicidal items of the HAMD-24 in Study HGGA and MADRS in HGGY) was observed in OFC-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients when the two placebocontrolled protocols were combined, but the results varied depending on the protocol (study), and were not consistent in the analyses of scale suicide items.</p><p>In summary, Lilly concluded that this review do not indicate an increased risk of suicidality in patients treated with OFC compared with those treated with placebo.</p></div>

In general, the changes observed in OFCtreated patients were consistent with changes that have previously been observed with OFC and its component monotherapies, particularly olanzapine. This observation is supported by review of the most common treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities seen at anytime in OFCtreated patients, which included: high prolactin (incidence rate of OFC vs. PLA: 27.6% vs. 4.8%), low total bilirubin (15.3% vs. 3.9%), low bicarbonate (14.1% vs. 8.8%), high ALT (7.8% vs. 0.5%), high fasting glucose (7.1% vs. 0%), high hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (5.9% vs. 0%), and high triglycerides (5.2% vs. 0%). Rates of abnormalities in OFC-treated patients tended to be similar to or lower than rates seen in olanzapine-treated patients; the only abnormalities seen statistically more often in patients treated with OFC than in patients treated with olanzapine were low erythrocytes (1.9% vs. 0.5%), high cholesterol (3.9% vs. 1.7%), and high fructosamine (4.6% vs. 1.3%). In contrast, numerous abnormalities were seen at higher rates in OFC-treated than in fluoxetine-treated or in placebo-treated patients, suggesting that OFC's safety profile with respect to treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities is similar to that of olanzapine.</p><p>There were several analytes for which OFC had statistically significantly greater mean changes than all three of the other treatment groups that were all examined in more detail: hematocrit, hemoglobin, erythrocyte count, and albumin (all decreases); and alkaline phosphatase, urea nitrogen, creatinine, and cholesterol (all increases).

However, it should be noted that the sample sizes for this analysis were quite low, as fasting glucose was not collected frequently in the included database.  Proportions of patients with treatment-emergent glycosuria were summarized and compared across treatment groups using Fisher's exact test. A statistically significantly higher proportion of OFC-treated patients had glycosuria (4.4%) than did fluoxetine-(0.4%) or placebo-treated (1.4%) patients; the proportion in OFC-treated patients was close to statistically significantly greater than that of olanzapine-treated patients (2.3%).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.4">Pediatrics</head><p>Lilly requested a full waver of pediatric studies for the use of Symbyax for the treatment of TRD in the pediatric population. The main reason justifying the request for waiver is that the studies of use of OFC to treat TRD in pediatric population are impossible or highly impractical, and Symbyax is not likely to be used in a substantial number of pediatric patients with TRD. Lilly provided the following points to support their request:</p><p>1. Recruitment of pediatric patients for a TRD study will be very difficult. Lilly mentioned that the NIMH-sponsored "Treatment of Resistant Depression in Adolescents (TORDIA) study, which commenced in 2001, has experienced slow recruitment, even with the more liberal definition of treatment resistant as failure of one adequate course of an SSRI.</p><p>2. The prevalence of TRD in pediatric population may be low. Base on recent literature search, MDD affects fewer than 10% of pediatric patients <ref type="bibr">(cheung et al, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Ryan, 2005)</ref> by estimation, and the recovery rate is high,70~90%, with or without treatment <ref type="figure">(Birmhauer et al, 2004</ref>).</p><p>3. Symbyax is unlikely to be used in a substantial number of pediatric patients. SSRIs are current recommended treatment for children with MDD or TRD in clinical practice. Atypical antipsychotics are rarely, if ever, used to treat TRD in pediatric patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.</head><p>Lilly recently completed acute and long term safety studies in adolescents with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Lilly has also completed pediatric studies of fluoxetine in depression. Thus, even if physicians may wish to consider Symbyax as a possible treatment for adolescents with TRD, no additional studies are needed to characterize the safety and efficacy of Symbyax in adolescent patients.</p><p>I personally agree with Lilly's arguments. In addition, Symbyax is associated with significant weight gain and potentially metabolic syndrome (appeared related to its olanzapine component) which will pose additional risk to children if pediatric OFC studies are conducted. I recommend a full waver of pediatric study for the use of Symbyax in treatment of TRD in pediatric population.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1.1 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</head><p>Among the sponsor-submitted five efficacy studies, only one study <ref type="bibr">(Study 2 of HDAO)</ref> clearly demonstrated the efficacy of olanzapine and fluoxetine combination (OFC) in treating patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD). Both HADO-1 and -2 studies had identical design and similar dropout rates. It was not clear what yielded inconsistent efficacy results between these two HDAO studies.</p><p>Although during an earlier meeting, FDA informed the sponsor that two positive studies would be required for an indication of treatment resistant depression, the sponsor argued in this NDA submission that based on the FDA Guidance (Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products) one clearly positive study with multiple studies supporting the new use would be sufficient for the approval. So, they listed other significant findings from Studies HGFR, HGIE and HGHZ to support the efficacy of the OFC.</p><p>From the sponsor's listed supportive evidence from Studies HGFR, HGIE and HGHZ, this reviewer only thinks that at most the results from Study HGIE could possibly be considered if the medical division really agrees with the sponsor that the subset of patients who had failed two antidepressants in their current episode fairly represent the patients in Study HDAO and they are the most suitable patients for being determined as patients with treatment resistant depression. However, we should note that OFC was not statistically significantly different from the olanzapine at Week 8 for this subset of patients and the positive findings at Week 12 might only come from the highest olanzapine and fluoxetine combination (OFC 12/50). In addition, the quality of data for identifying the subset of patients appeared questionable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">BRIEF OVERVIEW OF CLINICAL STUDIES</head><p>In this NDA submission, the sponsor included five efficacy double-blind active controlled clinical studies: H6P-MC-HDAO Study 1, H6P-MC-HDAO Study 2, F1D-MC-HGFR, F1D-MC-HGIE and FID-MC-HGHZ to seek the approval of the OFC in the treatment of patients with TRD. Of these five studies, two had an identical design (Studies 1 and 2 of HDAO) with patient who had failure of two antidepressants at an adequate dose and duration during the current depressive episode, one was a small pilot study (HGFR) with the same type of patients recruited as HDAO, and the other two were designed to require only the patients who had a failure of one antidepressant during the current depressive episode. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Study HGFR had the protocol pre-specified primary endpoint based on HAMD-21 total scores, but for the other four studies, the protocol pre-specified primary endpoint was based on MADRS total scores. Regarding the study duration, only Study HGIE was designed to have the 12 weeks of the acute phase, others had the 8 weeks of the acute phase. Of these five studies, it is actually only one positive study ( <ref type="bibr">HDAO Study 2)</ref>; the sponsor used three other studies to support the use of OFC in TRD and determined that one study (HDAO-Study 1) was inconclusive. The sponsor believed that these studies exhibited a clear pattern in the behavior of OFC in the treatment of patients with TRD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">STATISTICAL ISSUES AND FINDINGS</head><p>Basically, this reviewer confirmed the sponsor's analysis results for the primary endpoint, commonly proposed secondary endpoints and the subgroup analyses for all studies. Of the five efficacy studies (Studies HDAO-1, HDAO-2, HGFR, HGIE and HGHZ), Study HDAO-2 was the only one that clearly demonstrated the efficacy of OFC in the treatment of patients with TRD. Although Study HDAO-1 was an identical study with Study HDAO-2, it was a negative study, which did not show any supportive evidence for OFC's efficacy at the endpoint visit, or even any earlier visit.</p><p>According to the meeting minutes dated January 16, 2002, the FDA clearly informed the sponsor that because studies HGIE, HGHZ, and HGFR did not meet their primary endpoints, two additional positive studies would be required for an indication of TRD.</p><p>Using the FDA Guidance on Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products, the sponsor argued that in this NDA submission that a single adequate and well-controlled study demonstrating effectiveness of a new use can be used to support consideration of a new indication when there are "multiple studies supporting the new use, and expert judgment could conclude that the studies together represent substantial evidence of effectiveness." Two strong supportive evidence that the sponsor listed are as follows.</p><p>• For Study HGFR, the OFC showed statistically significantly greater reduction than both fluoxetine (p=0.012) and olanzapine (p=0.035) on the MADRS after 8 weeks of treatment. This was a small, pilot study (n=28) and therefore may not be readily generalizable, but it is noteworthy that treatment differences showed statistical separation despite the low power from a small sample size.</p><p>• For Study HGIE, OFC showed statistically significantly greater reduction on the MADRS than both fluoxetine (p=.010) and olanzapine (p=.006) after 8 weeks of treatment, although the difference over fluoxetine was only numerically superior after 12 weeks of treatment. In the subgroup of patients in Study HGIE who had failed two antidepressants in their current episode (that is, those who most closely resemble patients in <ref type="bibr">Study HDAO and Study HGFR)</ref>, OFC showed statistically significantly greater reduction on the MADRS than did fluoxetine (p=.021) or olanzapine (p=.003) after 12 weeks of treatment.</p><p>Regarding the sponsor's supportive evidence listed above, this reviewer agreed with the sponsor's numerical findings. However, this reviewer would like to emphasize that these analysis results were indeed based on post-hoc analyses. In addition, for Study HGFR, since this was a small pilot study with only 28 randomized patients, this reviewer has reservation to accept the significant results for the MADRS total score. This reviewer found that the data from this study was actually not very stable. When one of many selected patients was removed from the analysis, the p-value would be greater than 0.05, and also the sponsor's ANOVA model did not adjust for any other factors or covariates, although the primary analysis in such a setting is most commonly based on ANCOVA by including baseline value as a covariate in the model to adjust for potential differences in baseline scores. When the MADRS change from baseline to endpoint LOCF data were analyzed by the aforementioned ANCOVA model, it was found that the statistically significant differences between the OFC and each monotherapy were inconclusive (p-values=0.0503 and 0.0848, respectively) at the 0.05 significance level.</p><p>For Study HGIE, this reviewer agreed with the sponsor that OFC showed statistically significantly differences in comparison with both individual components at Week 8 and the significant findings at Week 12 for the subset of patients who had failed two antidepressants in their current episode. However, this reviewer is concerned about the quality of data for identifying this subset of patients and also would like to further point out that the significant findings for this subset of patients were found to be driven by the highest olanzapine and fluoxetine combination group, and at Week 8 the OFC did not show statistically significant difference in comparison with olanzapine although it did for the whole study population. These inconsistencies suggest the weakness of data in support of efficacy.</p><p>To sum up, from the statistical perspective, OFC's efficacy in treating patients with TRD was only supported by one clearly positive study. Data from those seemingly positive studies do not provide clearly supportive efficacy evidence and certainly do not add up to one positive study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">OVERVIEW</head><p>According to the sponsor, patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) continue to fail to achieve acceptable levels of functioning and well-being although some depressed patients improve significantly with antidepressant treatment. Currently, the pharmacological options for treatment of TRD includes titration to higher doses of the initial agent, change to an alternative agent within or outside of the same class of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">6</ref> antidepressants as the initial agent, augmentation, and combination therapy. Preclinical studies of olanzapine plus fluoxetine hydrochloride in combination (OFC) showed a synergistic effect that produced a sustained elevation of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine monoamine levels in the prefrontal cortex.</p><p>In January 2002, Lilly discussed with FDA the efficacy and safety results of completed clinical studies in TRD. FDA stated that because studies HGIE, HGHZ, and HGFR did not meet their primary endpoints, two additional positive studies would be required for an indication of TRD. As a result of that discussion, Lilly designed and conducted Study H6P-MC-HDAO (HDAO), a new TRD protocol that comprised two identical studies (HDAO Study 1 and HDAO <ref type="bibr">Study 2)</ref>. Lilly had a pre-NDA discussion with FDA on 14 April 2005, and during that discussion FDA indicated both HDAO Study 1 and HDAO Study 2 were needed in order to support the registration of OFC in this indication.</p><p>In this NDA submission, the sponsor included the aforementioned five double-blind active controlled clinical studies: H6P-MC-HDAO Study 1, H6P-MC-HDAO Study 2, F1D-MC-HGFR, F1D-MC-HGIE and FID-MC-HGHZ to seek the approval of OFC in the treatment of patients with TRD. Of these five studies, two had an identical design (Studies 1 and 2 of HDAO) with patients who had failure of two antidepressants at an adequate dose and duration during the current depressive episode, one was a small pilot study (HGFR) with the same type of patients recruited as in HDAO, and the other two studies were designed to require only the patients who had a failure of one antidepressant during the current depressive episode.</p><p>The protocol-prespecified primary endpoint was based on HAMD-21 total scores for Study HGFR, but it was based on MADRS total scores for the other four studies.</p><p>Regarding the duration of the acute-phase, only Study HGIE was designed to have the 12 weeks of the acute phase; others had the 8 weeks. <ref type="table" target="#tab_36">Table 1</ref> summarizes the sponsor's analysis results for these five studies. The sponsor concluded that there was only one positive study (HDAO <ref type="bibr">Study 2)</ref>, three other studies supported the use of OFC in TRD and one (HDAO-Study 1) was inconclusive. However, the sponsor believed that these studies exhibited a clear pattern in the behavior of OFC in the treatment of patients with TRD. Since Study HGHZ did not show any supportive evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of OFC, it was not included in this review. Although Study 1 of HDAO showed inconclusive results, it was included in this review for the purpose of comparison due to the same design as in Study 2 of HDAO. 0.021 0.003 * The primary analysis for the primary endpoint.

There were total 101 principal investigators in the United States and Canada involved in the two identical studies (Study 1 has 49 centers and Study 2 has 52 centers).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.1">Study Objective</head><p>The sponsor included two identical, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, outpatient studies (named Study 1 and Study 2) inside the folder of this Study HDAO. The primary objective for both studies was to assess the efficacy of up to 8 weeks of treatment with olanzapine plus fluoxetine in combination (OFC) versus fluoxetine and olanzapine monotherapies in patients with recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD) without psychotic features who met study criteria for treatmentresistant depression (TRD), as measured by last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) mean change from baseline to endpoint visit in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.2">Study Design</head><p>For both studies, after screening, patients entered an 8-week fluoxetine lead-in phase, followed by an 8-week double-blind treatment phase and an additional 8 weeks of open-label therapy. The following <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">Figure 1</ref> shows the detailed design. Note that for the olanzapoine component, patients could take 6 mg/day, 12 mg/day or 18 mg/day.</p><p>In order to increase the potential for reproducing results from two separate but identical trials, the sponsor incorporated the same design in these two studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">9</ref>  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Variables</head><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to endpoint visit in MADRS total score. The secondary efficacy variables were based on the HAM-A total score, CGI-Severity of Depression score, the BPRS total score and the BPRS positive item. The response and remission rates based on MDRS total score were also considered as secondary efficacy endpoints by the sponsor. A patient was considered a responder if he or she had a ≥ 50% LOCF mean decrease from baseline to endpoint visit in MADRS total score. On the other hand, remission was defined as a patient having MADRS total score ≤ 10 at endpoint visit. Sustained response and sustained remission were defined as meeting these criteria over at least two consecutive assessment periods, one of which was the endpoint visit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Analyses</head><p>The primary endpoint, the LOCF change from baseline (Visit 7) to endpoint visit in the MADRS total score was analyzed using ANOVA. The ANOVA model contained effects for investigator, treatment, and investigator-by treatment interaction (provided the interaction effect was statistically significant). Pair-wise comparisons of OFC to fluoxetine and to olanzapine were assessed using the least square means from this 11 fluoxetine in combination (OFC), fluoxetine, or olanzapine in Study Period III. There were 4 patients without post-baseline measurement; therefore the total number of patients in the ITT population became 298. A total of 220 patients completed the double-blind treatment phase and were followed in the open-label extension phase; an additional 9 patients were bridged from the fluoxetine lead-in to the open-label extension phase. For Study 2, a total of 675 patients received open-label fluoxetine during Study Period II, and 303 eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive double-blind OFC, fluoxetine, or olanzapine in Study Period III. Three patients did not have any post-baseline measure, so the total number of ITT population was 300. A total of 221 patients completed the double-blind treatment phase and were followed in the open-label extension phase; an additional 10 patients were bridged from the fluoxetine lead-in to the open-label extension phase.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>.2 summarizes patient demographic characteristics at baseline for patients who participated in the double-blind treatment phase. For both studies, the treatment groups appeared comparable with respect to age, racial origin, and sex. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.2">Sponsor's Efficacy Analysis Results for Primary Endpoint</head><p>As requested by FDA, the sponsor analyzed the primary endpoint, the mean change from baseline to endpoint visit(at 8 weeks) in the MADRS total score, by the ANCOVA with therapy and pooled investigator as effects and the baseline MADRS total score as a covariate. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>.3 shows the sponsor's LOCF analysis results for the primary endpoint for both studies. As shown in the table, for Study 1, OFC did not separate from fluoxetine or olanzapine, but for Study 2, OFC showed a statistically 13 significantly greater mean decrease on the MADRS than both fluoxetine and olanzapine. The sponsor's LOCF and OC analysis results for change from baseline to each visit on the MADRS total score are shown in Tables 6.1 to 6.4 of the Appendices. The conclusions made based on both LOCF and OC data seem to be very consistent. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.3">Sponsor's Efficacy Analysis Results for Secondary Endpoints</head><p>Analyses Based on Efficacy Rating Scales Tables 6.1 and 6.2 of the Appendices summarize the sponsor's LOCF analysis results for mean change from baseline to each visit on the MADRS total score. Tables 6.5 and 6.6 of the Appendices summarize the sponsor's LOCF analysis results for mean change from baseline to each visit on the HAM-A total score using the LOCF data. Tables 6.7 and 6.8 of the Appendices summarizes the sponsor's LOCF analysis results for mean change from baseline to each visit on the CGI-Severity Scale using LOCF data. As shown in the tables, based on the nominal significance level α=0.05 (i.e., not adjusted for multiplicity), in Study 1 the OFC treatment group had statistically significantly greater decreases on the MADRS total score, the HAM-A total score, and CGI-S scale than did the fluoxetine treatment group at Weeks 1 through 5, at Week 1 through 3, and at Weeks 2 and 3, respectively, though not at later points. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> 2. Since both studies had an identical design and also similar dropout rates, this reviewer was curious to know whether the main reason for the extremely different analysis results between these two studies was due to different doses taken among different patients in these two studies. At the same time, if the doses of olanzapine used in the OFC was very different from that used in the olanzapine arm, this reviewer questioned about the validity of the comparison between the OFC and olanzapine.</p><p>After calculating the average dose-use in different treatment arms for these two studies, this reviewer found that for these two studies, the mean dose used in the OFC, fluoxetine and olanzapine are indeed quite similar and also the mean dose of olanzapine used in the OFC were quite close to that for the mono-olanzapine. Therefore, the dose-use does not seem to be the reason for resulting different analysis results. This reviewer also agreed that data of Study 2 indeed supported the OFC's efficacy in treating patients with TRD.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3.1">Study Objective</head><p>The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of OFC (composite of the combination dosing groups excluding OFC 1/5) versus treatment with fluoxetine, olanzapine, and venlafaxine monotherapies. The patient population consisted of patients with MDD without psychotic features who met criteria for treatment resistant depression (TRD).</p><p>Treatment resistant depression was defined as:</p><p>• a failure to achieve satisfactory antidepressant response to an SSRI for at least 6 weeks at an acceptable dose and, • prospective failure to achieve satisfactory antidepressant response to the SNRI venlafaxine, as defined by a &lt;30% improvement on the MADRS during the 7-week venlafaxine lead-in phase.</p><p>The secondary objectives of the study were as follows:</p><p>• To assess the differences in safety and efficacy of the individual OFC treatment groups.</p><p>• Within the four combination treatment groups <ref type="bibr">(OFC 6/25,</ref><ref type="bibr">OFC 6/50,</ref><ref type="bibr">OFC 12/25,</ref><ref type="bibr">and OFC 12/50)</ref>, to assess the linear and interaction effects of olanzapine and fluoxetine in MADRS total scores.</p><p>• To assess the superiority in efficacy of OFC versus treatment with olanzapine, fluoxetine, or venlafaxine monotherapies as measured by the CGI-Severity of Depression rating scale.</p><p>• To assess co-morbid anxiety symptoms of patients receiving OFC treatment versus treatment with olanzapine, fluoxetine, or venlafaxine monotherapies as measured by HAM-A.</p><p>• To assess the safety of OFC treatment versus treatment with olanzapine, fluoxetine, or venlafaxine monotherapies as measured by the frequency and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events, changes in vital signs, laboratory analytes, or ECGs, and severity of EPS. The Simpson-Angus Scale, the Barnes Akathisia Scale, and the AIMS were used to measure extrapyramidal symptoms. Adverse events were solicited using the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersøgelser (UKU) side effect rating scale. The Arizona Sexual Dysfunction Scale (ASEX) monitored sexual function.</p><p>• To assess the direct and indirect costs associated with treatment and the health-related quality of life of patients on OFC versus treatment with olanzapine, fluoxetine, or venlafaxine monotherapies as measured by the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) and Quality of Life and Depression Scale (QLDS).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3.2">Study Design</head><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD without psychotic features as determined by clinical assessment and confirmed by diagnostic interview, and also met the treatment resistant depression criteria.</p><p>The study consisted of five phases. After a 2-to 7-day screening phase (Study Period I), patients began a 7-week venlafaxine lead-in phase <ref type="bibr">(Study Period II)</ref>. Patients received venlafaxine 75 to 375 mg/day during this phase.</p><p>During the taper phase (Study Period III), patients were assigned randomly (in equal allocation) to one of eight treatment groups:</p><p>• olanzapine 1 mg/day plus fluoxetine 5 mg/day (OFC 1/5) • olanzapine 6 mg/day plus fluoxetine 25 mg/day (OFC 6/25) • olanzapine 6 mg/day plus fluoxetine 50 mg/day (OFC 6/50) • olanzapine 12 mg/day plus fluoxetine 25 mg/day (OFC 12/25) • olanzapine 12 mg/day plus fluoxetine 50 mg/day (OFC 12/50) • olanzapine 6 or 12 mg/day (OLZ) • fluoxetine 25 or 50 mg/day (FLX)</p><p>• venlafaxine 75 to 375 mg/day (VNL)</p><p>For patients assigned to any other treatment group than venlafaxine, the venlafaxine dose were tapered off over a 5-to 9-day period. Patients assigned to venlafaxine maintained the dose attained at the end of the venlafaxine lead-in phase.</p><p>The acute phase <ref type="bibr">(Study Period IV)</ref> was the 12-week, double-blind treatment period of the study, and the open-label phase <ref type="bibr">(Study Period V)</ref> was the 52-week open-label OFC treatment period of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3.3">Efficacy Endpoints and Analyses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Endpoints</head><p>The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to endpoint visit in MADRS total score. The MADRS total score was also used to determine response, remission, and relapse.</p><p>• A responder was defined as any patient who demonstrated a 50% or greater decrease in MADRS total score from baseline to the last value of the acute phase. • A patient with two consecutive MADRS total scores of ≤8 in the acute phase was defined to be in remission. • A patient in remission with MADRS total scores ≥ 16 at two subsequent visits was defined to have relapsed.</p><p>Secondary efficacy measures included change from baseline to endpoint visit in CGI-Severity of Depression, HAM-A total, and BPRS total scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Analyses</head><p>The hypothesis of principal interest was that OFC was superior to olanzapine, fluoxetine, and venlafaxine as measured by LOCF mean change in MADRS total scores after up to 12 weeks of double-blind therapy (acute phase).</p><p>The analysis of variance (ANOVA) model was used to evaluate continuous data. The model included effects for treatment, geographic location, and treatment-bygeographic location interaction. Treatment-by-geographic location tested at α=0.10 and found not to be significant were dropped from the model. All other tests of hypotheses were tested at a two-tailed α level of 0.05.</p><p>All total scores from rating scales and subscales were derived from individual items. If any of the individual items were missing, the total score was treated as missing.</p><p>All analyses were performed on the original scale data unless the assumptions of the ANOVA appeared to be violated, in which case results from the rank-transformed data were reported. All analyses were conducted with SAS PROC GLM using Type III sums of squares.</p><p>In order to assess longitudinal effects, a likelihood-based repeated measures analysis (SAS PROC MIXED) was conducted on the post-baseline MADRS total score in the acute phase. The linear model for this analysis included effects for the baseline, treatment, geographic location, treatment-by-geographic location interaction, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction. All of these effects were considered fixed effects in the model. The estimates of effects were assessed by the method of restricted maximum likelihood using an unstructured covariance matrix for the within-patient error.</p><p>Observed case (OC) and LOCF visit-wise analyses of MADRS total, HAM-A total, and CGI-Severity of Depression scores were performed for the acute phase. An OC visit-wise analysis evaluates change from baseline at each visit for all patients who were active in the study at that visit. An LOCF visit-wise analysis evaluates change from baseline at each visit using that patient's score at that visit or the patient's last available score prior to that visit. Response, remission, and relapse rates were analyzed using Fisher's exact test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's Note:</head><p>In addition to the analysis for the change from baseline to Week 12 in the MADRS total score, the sponsor also performed the visit-wise change analysis and specifically emphasized the results for the change from baseline to Week 8 since the study duration for the other pivotal studies (Studies HDAO-1 and -2) only had the double blind period of 8 weeks. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>.4 shows a summary table of patient population for Study HGIE. As shown in the table, 483 patients were randomized to the acute phase of the study. There was an overall statistically significant difference among treatment groups for discontinuation because of an adverse event. More patients in the OFC 12/25 and OFC 12/50 treatment groups discontinued for an adverse event compared with the other treatment groups. It should be noted that patients in the venlafaxine treatment group had been receiving venlafaxine for seven weeks prior to randomization, so this factor may have contributed to the lower rate of discontinuation for adverse events among these patients during the acute phase.   </p></div>

The sponsor's analysis results for the mean change from baseline to Week 8, and to the other weeks in the MADRS total score are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>.7 and <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref>.13 of the Appendices, respectively.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.4.3">Sponsor's Efficacy Analysis Results for Secondary Endpoints</head><p>Since OFC did not show significant differences when compared with fluoxetine based on Week 12 data for the pre-specified primary endpoint and for all secondary endpoints, for the purpose of finding supportive evidences in conjunction with the only positive study (Study 1 of HDAO) only analysis results for the secondary endpoints based on Week 8 data are presented and discussed in this section. According to <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table  3</ref>.8 which summarizes the sponsor's analysis results for the mean change from baseline to Week 8 in MADRS total score (by the likelihood based repeated measure) and CGI-S (based on LOCF data), the previous significant findings based on the LOCF data for the comparisons between the composite OFC arm and the fluoxetine arm at Week 8 are also supported by the likelihood based repeated measure analysis. In addition, the composite OFC arm also won on the comparisons with both fluoxetine and olanzapine arms individually on the CGI-S scales. Week 12 in MADRS total score. This reviewer confirmed the sponsor's analysis results for the primary endpoint and those commonly proposed secondary endpoints.</p><p>Since the OFC did not show statistically significant difference from the fluoxetine in the primary endpoint based on the ITT population at Week 12, according to the protocol, Study HGIE is a negative study. <ref type="bibr">23</ref> The sponsor, however, argued that although the OFC did not show statistically significant difference in comparison with fluxoetine at Week 12, it showed significant results up to Week 8. In addition, for the subgroup of patients who had historical failure to the SSRI treatment during the current episode of MDD, OFC showed statistically significant difference in comparison with both fluoxetine and olanzapine individually at Week 12. The sponsor believed that this subset is a more treatment-resistant subset of the study population.</p><p>Regarding the sponsor's argument, if it is determined that the subset of patients with historical failure to SSRI treatment during the current episode is indeed to be a more appropriate treatment-resistant subset of the study population, the OFC did show statistically significantly better efficacy than both olanzapine and fluoxetine individually at Week 12. However, one should realize that the above subset analysis was not the pre-specified primary analysis and also note that the sponsor's efficacy conclusion for the OFC was based on the combined dose arms from four different combinations of olanzapine and fluoxetine (OFC 6/25, OFC 6/50, OFC 12/25 and OFC 12/50). When the comparisons between the specific dose combination and individual mono-therapies were further studied, it was found that only OFC 12/50 showed statistically significantly difference in comparisons with olanzapine and fluoxetine individually.</p><p>2. This reviewer wishes to emphasize that as mentioned earlier, the OFC was not statistically significantly separated from the fluoxetine alone at Week 12 at the primary endpoint and most secondary endpoints. Although at Week 8, the OFC showed statistically significant differences in comparison with the fluoxetine and olanzapine individually for the primary endpoint, it did not at the comparison with \ the olanzapine based on the subset of patients with historical failure to SSRI treatment during the current episode of MDD. These inconsistencies suggest the weakness of data in support of efficacy. The detailed analysis results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref>.14 of the Appendices.</p><p>3. The sponsor did not include the variable for identifying patients with historical failure to SSRI treatment during the current episode of MDD in the original submission. Before the sponsor sent in the requested variable, this reviewer tried to use the available data to identify the subset of patients.</p><p>Although this reviewer was later able to identify those subset patients and verify the sponsor's analysis results, it was found that patients' onset dates of current episode and dates of any previous therapy use were not well recorded. There were quite amount of dates only recorded by years. For patients' onset date of current episode, there were quite many of them being recorded over 10 or 20 years ago. For patients' starting date and stopping date of previous drug use, even some of them had the same year only recorded for both. So, it appears that reliability of data is questionable. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> Although the plan of analysis of this subset of patients was included in the SAP, it was not pre-specified in the original protocol. It is to be noted that the sponsor's SAP was dated "16-10-01", but the study duration was dated "March 2000-Sep 24, 2001". The analysis of this subset patients appeared to be a post-hoc analysis and the results could mainly be hypothesis-generated.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.5.1">Study Objective</head><p>The objective of this study was to assess the combination treatment of olanzapine (5 to 20 mg/day) plus fluoxetine (20 to 60 mg/day) versus treatment with olanzapine (5 to 20 mg/day) or fluoxetine (20 to 60 mg/day) alone in outpatients who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD) without psychotic features and who were nonresponsive to conventional therapy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.5.2">Study Design</head><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, multi-center study of patients meeting diagnostic criteria for MDD according to the DSM-IV and who were nonresponsive to conventional therapy.</p><p>The study consisted of three treatment phases. The fluoxetine lead-in phase (Study Period I) lasted for 6 weeks. All patients received open-label treatment with fluoxetine (20 to 60 mg/day, 1 capsule = 20 mg) during this phase. For the 8-week acute phase (Study Period II), patients were randomized to double-blind treatment with olanzapine (5 to 20 mg/day, 1 capsule = 5 mg) and fluoxetine (20 to 60 mg/day) in combination (OFC treatment group), fluoxetine 20 to 60 mg/day monotherapy, or olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day monotherapy. During the 8-week open-label phase, all patients received open-label treatment with OFC using the same dose ranges used for the acute phase. Throughout the study, fluoxetine was administered in the morning (AM dose) and olanzapine in the evening (PM dose).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.5.3">Efficacy Variables and Analyses</head><p>The primary efficacy measure was LOCF change from baseline (Visit 4) to endpoint visit (Visit 12) in HAMD-21 total score during the acute phase. If the baseline HAMD-21 observation was missing, then the patient was unevaluable for LOCF analysis. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> Treatment groups were also compared with respect to LOCF change from baseline to endpoint visit in the secondary efficacy rating scales and subscales (MADRS and CGI-Severity) during the acute phase. ANOVA models were used to evaluate these continuous efficacy data; these models included a effect for treatment only. In the open-label phase, the LOCF change from baseline to endpoint visit was also analyzed for the same efficacy measures.</p><p>Observed-case and LOCF visitwise analyses of HAMD-21 total score, MADRS total score, and CGI-Severity score were performed for the acute phase. An observed case visitwise analysis evaluates change from baseline to each visit for all patients who were active in the study at that visit. A LOCF visitwise analysis evaluates change from baseline to each visit using that patient's score at that visit or the patient's last available score prior to that visit. Similar analyses were performed for the open-label phase.</p><p>Response rates were compared among treatment groups for the acute phase. Response was defined as a ≥30% decrease from baseline to endpoint in HAMD-21 total score. Response rates were analyzed using Pearson's chi-square test.</p></div>

As shown in the table, there was no overall statistically significant difference in LOCF mean change from baseline to endpoint for the HAMD-21 total score among the treatment groups during the acute phase. However, an overall statistically significant difference (p=0.026) in mean change from baseline to endpoint for MADRS total score was observed among the treatment groups. OFC yielded a statistically significantly 27 greater mean decrease in MADRS total score when compared with both monotherapies. There was also an overall statistically significant difference (p=.003) in mean change from baseline to endpoint visit for CGI-Severity score among the treatment groups. The OFC yielded a statistically significantly greater mean decrease in CGI-Severity score when compared with both monotherapies (p=.005 and p=.001, respectively).</p><p>3.1.6.3 Statistical Reviewer's Findings and Comments 1. This reviewer has a reservation to accept Study HGFR as a positive study. The reasons are as follows:</p><p>(a) The primary endpoint of this study was the change from baseline to endpoint in HAMD-21 total score during the acute phase. This reviewer confirmed the sponsor's analysis results that OFC failed to demonstrate statistical significant difference when compared with each monotherapy.</p><p>(b) Although the sponsor pointed out that OFC demonstrated a statistically significant greater decrease in MADRS total score (the primary efficacy measure for other pivotal studies) from baseline to endpoint visit when compared with each monotherapy, it was based on a post-hoc analysis. In addition, with any of several selected patients deleted from the analysis, the statistical significance disappeared at nominal significance level of 0.05. This suggests that even the strength of evidence based on the post-hoc analysis (analysis of MADRS total score) is not strong.</p><p>(c) Although the differences in treatment effects between OFC and each monotherapy seem to be large, the baseline differences between treatment groups appeared large, too. This reviewer noticed that the sponsor's ANOVA did not adjust for any other factors or covariates, although the primary analysis in such a setting is most commonly based on ANCOVA by including baseline value as a covariate in the model to adjust for potential differences in baseline scores. When the MADRS change from baseline to endpoint LOCF data were analyzed by the aforementioned ANCOVA model, it was found that the statistically significant differences between the OFC and each monotherapy do not exist anymore at 0.05 significance level (p-values=0.0503 and 0.0848, respectively).</p><p>2. Since this study was a pilot study with only 28 randomized patients, this reviewer carefully checked the normality assumption required for ANCOVA analysis. It was found that the data were fairly normally distributed.</p></div>

The certain illness characteristics consisted of age of onset of depression, number of previous episodes of depression, number of previous depressive episodes in the last 36 months, historical failure to respond to an SSRI in the current episode, historical failure to two antidepressants in the current episode, and family history of MDD.</p><p>In this section, only the subgroup analysis by gender, race, age for all reviewed pivotal studies and for Study HGIE, also the analysis for patients with historical failure to SSRI treatment during the current episode of MDD are presented and discussed.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">STATISTICAL ISSUES AND COLLECTIVE EVIDENCE</head><p>Basically, this reviewer confirmed the sponsor's analysis results for the primary endpoint, commonly proposed secondary endpoints and the subgroup analyses for all studies. Of the five efficacy studies (Studies HDAO-1, HDAO-2, HGFR, HGIE and HGHZ), Study HDAO-2 was the only one that clearly demonstrated the efficacy of OFC in the treatment of patients with TRD. Although Study HDAO-1 was an identical study with Study HDAO-2, it was a negative study, which did not show any supportive evidence for the OFC's efficacy at the endpoint visit, or even any earlier visit.</p><p>According to the meeting minutes dated January 16, 2002, the FDA clearly informed the sponsor that because studies HGIE, HGHZ, and HGFR did not meet their primary endpoints, two additional positive studies would be required for an indication of TRD. Using the FDA Guidance on Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products, the sponsor argued (in this NDA submission) that a single adequate and well-controlled study demonstrating effectiveness of a new use <ref type="bibr">32</ref> can be used to support consideration of a new indication when there are "multiple studies supporting the new use, and expert judgment could conclude that the studies together represent substantial evidence of effectiveness." Two strong supportive evidence that the sponsor listed are as follows.</p><p>• For Study HGFR, the OFC showed statistically significantly greater reduction than both fluoxetine (p=0.012) and olanzapine (p=0.035) on the MADRS after 8 weeks of treatment. This was a small, pilot study (n=28) and therefore may not be readily generalizable, but it is noteworthy that treatment differences showed statistical separation despite the low power from a small sample size</p><p>• For Study HGIE, OFC showed statistically significantly greater reduction on the MADRS than both fluoxetine (p=.010) and olanzapine (p=.006) after 8 weeks of treatment, although the difference over fluoxetine was only numerically superior after 12 weeks of treatment. In the subgroup of patients in Study HGIE who had failed two antidepressants in their current episode (that is, those who most closely resemble patients in <ref type="bibr">Study HDAO and Study HGFR)</ref>, OFC showed statistically significantly greater reduction on the MADRS than did fluoxetine (p=.021) or olanzapine (p=.003) after 12 weeks of treatment.</p><p>Regarding the sponsor's supportive evidence listed above, this reviewer agreed with the sponsor's numerical findings. However, this reviewer would like to emphasize that these analysis results were indeed based on post-hoc analyses and interpretations of these results are questionable. In particular, for Study HGFR, this reviewer has reservation to accept this study as a positive study. The reasons are as follows: (a) The sponsor failed to demonstrate the superiority of OFC with respect to the pre-specified primary endpoint based on HAMD-21 total score. (b) Although the sponsor pointed out that OFC was shown superior to each monotherapy with respect to the efficacy measure MADRS total score (primary efficacy measure for other pivotal studies), the result was hypothesis-generated. In addition, with any of several selected patients deleted from the analysis, the statistical significance disappeared at nominal significance level of 0.05. This suggests that even the strength of evidence based on the post-hoc analysis is not strong. (c) The ANOVA model used to analyze the MADRS total score did not consider the baseline differences. When the ANOVA model including the baseline as a covariate was used to analyze the change from baseline to endpoint visit for the MADRS total score, the statistically significant difference between the OFC and each monotherapy were inconclusive (p-values=0.0503 and 0.0848, respectively) at the 0.05 significance level.</p><p>For Study HGIE, the sponsor failed to demonstrate the superiority of OFC on the prespecified patient population (patients who had failed at least one anti-depressant) at the pre-specified endpoint visit (Week 12) although the result at Visit 8 was statistically significant at nominal significance level α = 0.05. Analysis of Visit 8 data can only be considered exploratory because the nominal significance level α was not adjusted for multiple analyses. Although OFC was shown to be superior to both individual components (at nominal significance level α = 0.05) at the pre-specified endpoint visit (Week 12) on the subset of patients who had failure of two antidepressants during the current episode, OFC failed to show superior to olanzapine at Week 8 on the same subset of patients. These inconsistencies suggest the weakness of data in support of efficacy.</p><p>This reviewer would like to further point out that the significant findings at Week 12 for that subset of patients was found to be driven by the highest olanzapine and fluoxetine combination group. Moreover, when the patients' onset dates of current episodes and dates of previous therapy use were utilized to identify the subset of patients, the quality of data appeared to be questionable.</p><p>To sum up, from the statistical perspective, OFC's efficacy in treating patients with TRD was only supported by one clearly positive study. Data from those seemingly positive studies do not provide clearly supportive efficacy evidence and certainly do not add up to one positive study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</head><p>Among the sponsor-submitted five efficacy studies, only one study (Study 2 of HDAO) clearly demonstrated the efficacy of olanzapine and fluoxetine combination (OFC) in treating patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD). Both HADO-1 and -2 studies had identical design and similar dropout rates. It was not clear what yielded inconsistent efficacy results between these two HDAO studies.</p><p>Although during an earlier meeting, FDA informed the sponsor that two positive studies would be required for an indication of treatment resistant depression, the sponsor argued in this NDA submission that based on the FDA Guidance (Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products) one clearly positive study with multiple studies supporting the new use would be sufficient for the approval. So, they listed other significant findings from Studies HGFR, HGIE and HGHZ to support the efficacy of the OFC.</p><p>From the sponsor's listed supportive evidence from Studies HGFR, HGIE and HGHZ, this reviewer only thinks that at most the results from Study HGIE could possibly be considered if the medical division really agrees with the sponsor that the subset of patients who had failed two antidepressants in their current episode fairly represent the patients in Study HDAO and they are the most suitable patients for being determined as patients with treatment resistant depression. However, we should note that OFC was not statistically significantly different from the olanzapine at Week 8 for this subset of patients and the positive findings at Week 12 might only come from the highest olanzapine and fluoxetine combination (OFC 12/50). In addition, the quality of data for identifying this subset of patients appeared questionable.           <ref type="bibr">11.a.17., 11,a,18, 11.a.21 and 11.a.22.</ref>   <ref type="bibr">HDAO.11b.17,</ref><ref type="bibr">11.b.18,</ref><ref type="bibr">11.b.21 and 11.b.22</ref> </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Weight Gain</head><p>In adult placebo controlled trials (3-8 weeks, median exposure approximately 7 weeks) olanzapine-treated patients had a mean weight gain of 2.64 kg compared to a mean weight loss of 0.26 kg in placebo-treated subjects (P &lt; 0001). Mean differences in weight change between olanzapine-treated subjects and placebo treated subjects were similar across baseline BMI groups. Mean weight gain in olanzapine-treated subjects increased and mean weight loss in placebo-treated subjects was also successively greater at successive endpoints from 2-48 weeks. In addition, the proportion of olanzapinetreated subjects with clinically significant weight gain generally increased at successive time points from 6 weeks to 36 months. The incidence of treatment-emergent weight gain of at least 7% was 22.2% for olanzapine and 3.0% for placebo (median exposure time of about 8 weeks in both treatment groups).</p><p>In comparator-controlled trials, weight gain (mean change in weight, % of patients with potentially clinically significant weight gain, and proportion with upward shift in BMI category) was similar for olanzapine and clozapine-treated patients. Results were also similar for olanzapine compared to quetiapine-treated patients, although Dr. Mentari notes that the majority of patients in that database were overweight or obese at baseline, resulting in limited utility in generalizing beyond that population. Greater weight gain was observed for olanzapine compared to risperidone, olanzapine compared to ziprasidone, and for olanzapine compared to haloperidol.</p><p>In the OFC Adult controlled database, mean weight gain in OFC treated subjects was 4.29 kg at 8 weeks compared with a mean weight loss of 0.54 kg in placebo treated subjects (p &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference in weight gain between OFCtreated subjects and olanzapine treated subjects.</p><p>Adolescents treated with olanzapine also experienced clinically significant and statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001) mean weight gain of 4.6 kg in 3 weeks median exposure time for olanzapine-treated adolescents compared to 0.34 kg in placebo treated patients. As compared to the data above for adults, the rate of increase was greater than that observed in approximately 7 weeks median exposure in adults. In long term studies (at least 24 weeks), the mean weight gain was 11.2 kg. With short-term exposure, 40.6% of adolescents gained (median exposure 3.5weeks) at least 7% of baseline body weight vs 9.8% of placebo-treated adolescents (median exposure 14 weeks), and with long-term exposure the percentages who gained at least 7%, 15% or 25% of baseline body weight were 89%, 55%, and 29%, respectively. Since OFC has not been systematically studied in adolescents, data from the olanzapine monotherapy studies has been added to the SYMBYAX label to provide information on adolescents.</p><p>Dr. Mentari shows that the mean increases in weight were generally greater for the olanzapine-treated antipsychotic naïve population than for the olanzapine-treated adult Safety Team Leader Memo NDA 20-592, 21-520 3 population (naïve and non-naïve) when patients were normal, overweight or obese at baseline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Hyperlipidemia</head><p>In adult placebo-controlled trials, the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) analyses of mean change from baseline to endpoint showed statistically significantly greater mean increases for olanzapine compared to placebo for fasting and non-fasting total cholesterol, fasting LDL cholesterol and fasting triglycerides (median olanzapine exposure times of <ref type="bibr">6-8 weeks)</ref>. Mean increases in fasting lipid measurements were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline. Data are also shown to suggest that the mean nonfasting total cholesterol in patients who completed 12 months of therapy did not increase further after approximately 4-6 months. Proportions of patients with clinically significant changes in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, or triglycerides from normal or borderline to high, or changes in HDL cholesterol from normal or borderline to low were greater in long-term studies compared with short term studies.</p><p>The following data were extracted from Dr. Mentari's review. Statistically significantly higher proportions of olanzapine-treated patients than placebotreated patients met criteria for treatment-emergent significant increases for nonfasting total cholesterol, fasting total cholesterol, fasting triglycerides, and fasting LDL cholesterol based on the criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP).</p><p>In comparator-controlled trials, patients treated with olanzapine had greater mean increases in total cholesterol than did patients treated with risperidone. Patients treated with clozapine and olanzapine had comparable changes with respect to total cholesterol. In the quetiapine database there were no statistically significant changes in fasting or nonfasting lipid parameters. Dr. Mentari points out that the median exposure time on olanzapine-treated subjects was significantly greater than the median exposure time for quetiapine-treated subjects, and that the study population in one of the studies had overweight or obese as an entry criteria. For the ziprasidone-controlled database, olanzapine-treated patients had significantly different decreased HDL cholesterol, statistically significantly smaller decrease of mean fasting LDL, and a statistically Safety Team Leader Memo NDA 20-592, 21-520 4 significant difference in mean fasting triglycerides that increased in olanzapine-treated patients and decreased in ziprasidone-treated patients. Information was also provided from the CATIE study to suggest that patients who received olanzapine had an exposureadjusted mean increase in total cholesterol and in triglycerides compared to ziprasidone, risperidone, quetiapine, and perphenazine. In that study the mean exposure-adjusted increase in triglycerides was 40.5 mg/dL and in total cholesterol was 9.4 mg/dL in patients who received olanzapine.</p><p>In the OFC database, information was available for only total cholesterol and triglycerides. Dr. Mentari reports that OFC-treated subjects had an increase from baseline in mean random total cholesterol of 12.1 mg/dL that was statistically significant compared to an increase of 4.8 mg/dL for olanzapine-treated subjects and a decrease of 5.5 mg/dL for placebo-treated subjects. From controlled clinical studies up of to 12 weeks, there were statistically significantly more patients with increases in nonfasting total cholesterol of ≥ 40 mg/dL in 35% of OFC patients compared to either olanzapine (22.7%) or placebo (9%) and statistically significantly more patients changing from borderline to high or normal to high in OFC vs either olanzapine or placebo. In longterm studies (at least 48 weeks) changes in nonfasting total cholesterol from normal to high occurred at least once in 12% of patients and changes from borderline to high occurred in 56% of patients. Dr. Mentari points out that the incidence of statistically significant changes in lipid parameters in patients treated with OFC and olanzapine in the OFC database was greater than the incidence in patients treated with olanzapine in the olanzapine databases, and hypothesizes that this is due to the different populations in the 2 databases, making them difficult to compare.</p><p>Placebo-controlled studies in adolescents had a short median duration of exposure at the time of lipid measurement of 2-3 weeks. In the analysis of 3 placebo-controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies of adolescents, olanzapine-treated adolescents had statistically significant increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides of 12.9 mg/dL, 6.5 mg/dL, and 28.4 mg/dL, respectively, compared to increases from baseline in 1.3 mg/dL, 1.0 mg/dL for fasting total cholesterol and LDL, respectively and a decrease in triglycerides of 1.1 mg/dL for placebo treated adolescents. In long-term studies (at least 24 weeks), there were increases in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides of 5.5 mg/dL, 5.4 mg/dL, and 20.5 mg/dL, respectively and a mean decrease in fasting HDL of 4.5 mg/dL.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUBJECT: Medication Guides for Symbyax, Zyprexa, and Prozac</head><p>The Division is in the process of evaluating Symbyax (olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination) for the treatment of Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD). Symbyax is a marketed product approved for the acute treatment of depressive episodes of Bipolar I Disorder. At the same time, Zyprexa (olanzapine) and Prozac (fluoxetine) are being evaluated to be used in combination to treat TRD and the acute treatment of depressive episodes of Bipolar I Disorder. The Division determined that modifications to the existing Medication Guide would be necessary for Symbyax secondary to the metabolic changes seen with olanzapine (hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and weight gain) so that patients will be able, in light of these metabolic changes, to make an informed decision about the risks and benefits of the drug.</p><p>Having made a decision to include this information in a Medication Guide, and given that Zyprexa and Prozac also have supplements pending to be used together to treat TRD and the acute episodes of Bipolar I Disorder, it became clear that the Division would have to include the information from the updated Symbyax Medication Guide in the Medication Guides for both Zyprexa and Prozac.</p><p>For Zyprexa, the Medication Guide is new and was derived from those portions of the Symbyax Medication Guide pertinent to olanzapine. For Prozac, the already existing class Medication Guide for suicidality had to be modified to include the other particular serious and significant concerns for fluoxetine.</p><p>In sum, the Division decided to make changes to the Zyprexa and Prozac Medications Guides to ensure that when a patient is treated with both drugs for TRD or depressive episodes of Bipolar I Disorder, they receive the same information from the combination of the two individual product Medication Guides that is presented in the single combination product Medication Guide for Symbyax.</p><p>We requested draft Medication Guides for all three products from the sponsor in our August 1, 2008 complete response letter. The sponsor submitted a response to the Agency letter on September 19, 2008 and the review division consulted the Division of Risk Management (DRISK) in the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology (OSE) to assist us with editing these prior to negotiation with the sponsor. Although DRISK was consulted early in the process <ref type="bibr">(September 25, 2008)</ref>, they were unable to provide draft edits to our Medication Guides until much later <ref type="bibr">(February 20, 2009</ref>). We had two meetings <ref type="bibr">(February 19, 2009 and</ref><ref type="bibr">March10, 2009</ref>) with DRISK to understand their draft edits to the Medication Guides.</p><p>The advice we received from DRISK was useful in helping us to formulate our final documents, and we incorporated many of their suggested changes. However, we did not agree with some of their proposed changes because we felt they significantly detracted from the overall message we intended to send to the patients receiving these products. Specifically, the recommendations from DRISK included adding information from every bullet within the Warnings and Precautions section of labeling in an effort to provide a comprehensive picture of the risk of these drugs. While this seamed reasonable on face, it practically meant that the Medication Guides would be nearly eight pages long, which in our opinion made it a much less likely document to be distributed by pharmacists and read by the patients. In addition, <ref type="bibr">21CFR 208.20</ref> states that Medication Guides should written to convey, "the particular serious and significant pubic health concern that has created the need for a Medication Guide…" and we did not believe that including every warning and precaution, particularly if there was no direct way to communicate risk to the patient, would be consistent with our interpretation of this regulation.</p><p>Therefore, we included only the particular serious and significant public health concerns in our versions of the Medication Guides sent to the sponsor for negotiation, and we will include these Medication Guides in any future approval letters for these products. </p></div>

FDA has determined that Symbyax (olanzapine and fluoxetine hydrochloride) meets two of the three criteria for a Medication Guide as set forth in 21 CFR 208.1: Symbyax (olanzapine and fluoxetine hydrochloride) is a product that has serious risks (relative to benefits) of which patients should be made aware because information concerning the risks could affect patients' decision to use or continue to use; Symbyax (olanzapine and fluoxetine hydrochloride) is a product for which patient labeling could help prevent serious adverse events.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">PROPOSED REMS a. Goal</head><p>The sponsor has proposed the following revised REMS goal, as requested:</p><p>The goal of the REMS is to inform patients of the serious risks associated with the use of Zyprexa (olanzapine), including the risks of suicidality, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and weight gain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>b.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</head><p>DRISK believes that the sponsor's amended proposed REMS for Symbyax (olanzapine and fluoxetine hydrochloride) generally meets the statutory requirements outlined in 21 CFR 208 and in accordance with 505-1. The sponsor revised the REMS goal as requested, but also included the risk of suicidality, which is associated with Symbyax (olanzapine and fluoxetine hydrochloride). Given that Symbyax currently carries the Antidepressant Drug Product class approved MG for the issue of suicidality, the sponsor's proposed revised goal, is acceptable. Below we have additional recommendations on the proposed REMS. If the revisions are acceptable to DPP, DRISK does not need to review this material again prior to approval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations to be conveyed to Sponsor</head><p>1. See the appended Symbyax (olanzapine and fluoxetine hydrochloride) REMS proposal (Appendix A) for minor additional track changes corresponding to comments in this review.</p><p>2. We remind the sponsor of their requirement to comply with 21 CFR 208.24</p><p>• A required statement alerting the dispenser to provide the Medication Guide with the product must be on the carton and container of all strengths and formulations. We recommend the following language dependent upon whether the Medication Guide accompanies the product or is enclosed in the carton (for example, unit of use): "Dispense the enclosed Medication Guide to each patient." or "Dispense the accompanying Medication Guide to each patient."</p><p>• Sufficient numbers of Medication Guides should be provided with the product such that a dispenser can provide one Medication Guide with each new or refilled prescription. We recommend that each packaging configuration contain enough Medication Guides so that one is provided for each "usual" or average dose. For example:</p><p>• A minimum of four Medication Guides would be provided with a bottle of 100 for a product where the usual or average dose is 1 capsule/tablet daily, thus a monthly supply is 30 tablets.</p><p>• A minimum of one Medication Guide would be provided with unit of use where it is expected that all tablets/capsules would be supplied to the patient.</p><p>3. The timetable for submission of assessments will be at minimum at 18 months, 3 years and within the 7th year following the approval of the REMS.</p><p>• The REMS assessments should include information needed to asesss the effectiveness of the REMS including:</p><p>• Patients' understanding of the serious risks of Symbyax (olanzapine and fluoxetine hydrochloride) • A report on periodic assessments of the distribution and dispensing of the Medication Guide in accordance with 21 CFR 208.24</p><p>• A report on failures to adhere to distribution and dispensing requirements, and corrective actions taken to address noncompliance</p><p>• If the sponsor feels the REMS assessment at 7 years of the patient's understanding of the Medication Guide is not needed because they have determined that serious risks have been adequately identified and assessed, the sponsor should submit a modification to the REMS following the REMS 3 year assessment. The agency will then determine if additional assessments of the patient's understanding of the Medication Guide are necessary.</p><p>4. We recommend the Sponsor submit a complete description of methodology and the instruments used to measure patient's understanding of the risks and safe use of Symbayx to FDA 60 days prior to conducting the survey. The submission should include:</p><p>o All methodology and instruments that will be used to evaluate the patients' understanding about the safe use of Symbyax (olanzapine and fluoxetine hydrochloride). This should include, but not be limited to:</p><p>Sample size and confidence associated with that sample size</p><p>How the sample will be determined (selection criteria)</p><p>The expected number of patients to be surveyed</p><p>How the participants will be recruited How and how often the surveys will be administered Explain controls used to minimize bias Explain controls used to compensate for the limitations associated with the methodology o The survey instruments (questionnaires and/or moderator's guide).</p><p>o Any background information on testing survey questions and correlation to the messages in the Medication Guide.</p><p>Recommendation for DPP 4 5. We recommend including in the approval letter a reminder of the sponsor's responsibility to provide the information needed (methodology) to assess the effectiveness of the REMS as stated above, including an evaluation of: o Patients' understanding of the serious risks of Symbyax (olanzapine and fluoxetine hydrochloride) o A report on periodic assessments of the distribution and dispensing of the Medication Guide in accordance with 21 CFR 208.24 o A report on failures to adhere to distribution and dispensing requirements, and corrective actions taken to address noncompliance Please let us know if you have any questions.</p></div>

Our recommended changes are consistent with current research to improve risk communication to a broad audience, including those with lower literacy.</p><p>The draft MG submitted by the sponsor has a Flesch Kinkaid grade level of 9.3, and a Flesch Reading Ease score of 52.1%. To enhance patient comprehension, materials should be written at a 6 th to 8 th grade reading level, and have a reading ease score of at least 60% (60% corresponds to an 8 th grade reading level.) Our revised MG has a Flesch Kinkaid grade level of 8.2 and a Flesch Reading Ease score of 60.3%.</p><p>In our review of the MG, we have:</p><p>• simplified wording and clarified concepts where possible,</p><p>• ensured that the MG is consistent with the PI, • rearranged information as necessary to be consistent with the MG format as specified in 21 CFR 208.20 • removed unnecessary or redundant information • ensured that the MG meets the Regulations as specified in 21 CFR 208.20.</p><p>• ensured that the MG meets the criteria as specified in FDA's Guidance for Useful Written Consumer Medication Information (published July 2006).</p><p>In 2008, The American Society of Consultant Pharmacists Foundation in collaboration with The American Foundation for the Blind published Guidelines for Prescription Labeling and Consumer Medication Information for People with Vision Loss. They recommend using fonts such as Arial, Verdana, or APHont to make medical information more accessible for patients with low vision. We have reformatted the MG document using the font APHont, which was developed by the American Printing House for the Blind specifically for low vision readers.</p><p>See the attached document for our recommended revisions to the MG. Comments to the review division are bolded, underlined and italicized.</p><p>We are providing the review division a marked-up and clean copy of the revised MG. We recommend using the clean copy as the working document.</p><p>All future relevant changes to the PI should also be reflected in the MG. 4 6. We recommend including in the approval letter a reminder of the sponsor's responsibility to provide the information needed (methodology) to assess the effectiveness of the REMS as stated above, including an evaluation of: o Patients' understanding of the serious risks of o A report Symbyax (olanzapine and fluoxetine hydrochloride) on periodic assessments of the distribution and dispensing of the Medication Guide in accordance with 21 CFR 208.24 o A report on failures to adhere to distribution and dispensing requirements, and corrective actions taken to address noncompliance</p><p>We have the following comments on the sponsor's Questions Regarding REMS:</p><p>The following comments were sent to DPP on February 20, 2009 to share with the sponsor prior to completion of a full review of the MG and REMS for Symbyax: </p></div>

No significant inconsistency was found.Exposure-response relationship was not studied in all TRD studies, except Study HGIE.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Background</head><p>In an approvable letter, received by Lilly on March 28, 2007, for a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Symbyax® [olanzapine/fluoxetine combination (OFC)] for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression (TRD), FDA requested analyses related to weight gain, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia. FDA included similar requests in the approvable letter for two sNDAs for Zyprexa for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (acute manic or mixed episodes) in adolescent patients, received by Lilly on April 30, 2007. FDA and Lilly established a plan for specific analyses to be submitted; this plan was discussed in a meeting between FDA and Lilly on May 24, 2007. Lilly provided the requested data in a series of 4 rolling submissions, the last of which was received May 12, 2008.</p><p>Subject groups evaluated included all adult subjects, pediatric and adolescent subjects, and antipsychotic-naïve subjects. For each group the data were to be from placebo controlled trials, comparator controlled trials, and all data controlled and uncontrolled. The OFC databases were from studies in depression that included an OFC treatment group and at least an olanzapine treatment group or a fluoxetine treatment group. Excluded were studies without a source drug monotherapy arm, studies with duration under 7 days, studies with a relapse-prevention study design in which subjects had source drug exposure prior to randomization, and studies evaluation the source drug using routes of drug delivery other than oral drug delivery.</p><p>This memorandum summarizes the safety team review of these submissions. The primary review was conducted by Dr. Evelyn Mentari. In addition to the specific analyses that were agreed upon, the sponsor's proposed labeling includes data on metabolic changes from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) studies that Dr. Mentari has reviewed. In addition to summarizing the findings from Dr. Mentari's review, I will summarize in more detail the Sponsor's Risk Management Plan.</p><p>Safety Team Leader Memo NDA 20-592, 21-520 This is a representation of an electronic record that was signed electronically and this page is the manifestation of the electronic signature.</p></div>

An inspection summary addendum will be generated if conclusions change significantly upon receipt and review of the EIR.</p><p>At this site a total of 40 subjects were screened, 20 subjects were screened failures, 20 subjects were randomized and completed the study. The medical records for eight <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(8)</ref> subjects were reviewed. Informed consent for 40 subjects was verified and minor regulatory violations were found. These include failure to re-consent 6 subjects with the revised IRB approved informed consent, and at least two subjects (1176 &amp; 1184) did not date, and one subject (1190) did not sign the consent form. One subject (1167) received two prohibited medications (Valium &amp; Restoril) while on the study. There was inadequate and inaccurate record keeping in that missing doses were not recorded, and no documentation to show that the dose of venlafaxine was increased per Doctor's orders in at least 5 out of 8 subjects records reviewed. Drug accountability and dispensing records for at least 6 subjects were incomplete and therefore, the FDA investigator could not verify the amount of drug dispensed versus the amount returned by subjects for certain visits. There were no known limitations to this inspection.</p><p>The data appear acceptable in support of the pending application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF FINDINGS AND GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS</head><p>The inspection of Dr. Beckett revealed problems with the informed consent procedures, a protocol deviation, inadequate records, and inadequate drug accountability record keeping. However, in general these deviations do not adversely impact data acceptability. The data submitted are acceptable in support of the pending application.</p><p>The inspection of Dr. Bergeron revealed no significant problems that would adversely impact data acceptability.

Appendix A to NDA Regulatory Filing Review NOTE: The term "original application" or "original NDA" as used in this appendix denotes the NDA submitted. It does not refer to the reference drug product or "reference listed drug."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</head><p>An original application is likely to be a 505(b)(2) application if:</p><p>(1) it relies on published literature to meet any of the approval requirements, and the applicant does not have a written right of reference to the underlying data. If published literature is cited in the NDA but is not necessary for approval, the inclusion of such literature will not, in itself, make the application a 505(b)(2) application, (2) it relies for approval on the Agency's previous findings of safety and efficacy for a listed drug product and the applicant does not own or have right to reference the data supporting that approval, or (3) it relies on what is "generally known" or "scientifically accepted" about a class of products to support the safety or effectiveness of the particular drug for which the applicant is seeking approval. (Note, however, that this does not mean any reference to general information or knowledge (e.g., about disease etiology, support for particular endpoints, methods of analysis) causes the application to be a 505(b)(2) application.)</p><p>Types of products for which 505(b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(2)</ref> applications are likely to be submitted include: fixed-dose combination drug products (e.g., heart drug and diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) combinations); OTC monograph deviations(see 21 CFR 330.11); new dosage forms; new indications; and, new salts.</p><p>An efficacy supplement can be either a (b)(1) or a (b)(2) regardless of whether the original NDA was a (b)(1) or a (b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(2)</ref>.</p><p>An efficacy supplement is a 505(b)(1) supplement if the supplement contains all of the information needed to support the approval of the change proposed in the supplement. For example, if the supplemental application is for a new indication, the supplement is a 505(b)(1) if:</p><p>(1) The applicant has conducted its own studies to support the new indication (or otherwise owns or has right of reference to the data/studies),</p><p>(2) No additional information beyond what is included in the supplement or was embodied in the finding of safety and effectiveness for the original application or previously approved supplements is needed to support the change. For example, this would likely be the case with respect to safety considerations if the dose(s) was/were the same as (or lower than) the original application, and.</p><p>(3) All other "criteria" are met (e.g., the applicant owns or has right of reference to the data relied upon for approval of the supplement, the application does not rely for approval on published literature based on data to which the applicant does not have a right of reference).</p><p>An efficacy supplement is a 505(b)(2) supplement if:</p><p>(1) Approval of the change proposed in the supplemental application would require data beyond that needed to support our previous finding of safety and efficacy in the approval of the 5. The purpose of the questions below (questions 5 to 6) is to determine if there is an approved drug product that is equivalent or very similar to the product proposed for approval that should be referenced as a listed drug in the pending application.</p><p>(a) Is there a pharmaceutical equivalent(s) to the product proposed in the 505(b)(2) application that is already approved? YES NO (Pharmaceutical equivalents are drug products in identical dosage forms that: (1) contain identical amounts of the identical active drug ingredient, i.e., the same salt or ester of the same therapeutic moiety, or, in the case of modified release dosage forms that require a reservoir or overage or such forms as prefilled syringes where residual volume may vary, that deliver identical amounts of the active drug ingredient over the identical dosing period; (2) do not necessarily contain the same inactive ingredients; and (3) meet the identical compendial or other applicable standard of identity, strength, quality, and purity, including potency and, where applicable, content uniformity, disintegration times, and/or dissolution rates.

SYMBYAX (olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination) is approved for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with Bipolar Disorder in adults.</p><p>The Division of Psychiatry Products (DPP) became aware of new treatment emergent safety signals of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and significant weight gain associated with olanzapine treatment. These data were presented in recent supplements for Zyprexa to treat adolescent schizophrenia and manic or mixed episodes of Bipolar I Disorder, and in a supplement for SYMBYAX to treat treatment resistant depression.

In addition, DPP has determined that patients (regardless of age and diagnosis) and their caregivers should be provided with a Medication Guide to help them understand these risks and how to manage them (including monitoring requirements for body weight as well as recommended serum glucose and lipid monitoring In accordance with section 505-1 of the FDCA, as one element of a REMS, FDA may require the development of a Medication Guide as provided for under 21 CFR Part 208. Pursuant to 21 CFR Part 208, FDA has determined that ZYPREXA AND SYMBYAX poses a serious and significant public health concern requiring the distribution of a Medication Guide. The Medication Guide is necessary for patients' safe and effective use of these products. FDA has determined that ZYPREXA AND SYMBYAX are products that have serious risks of which patients should be made aware because information concerning the risks could affect patients' decisions to use, or continue to use, 3 ZYPREXA OR SYMBYAX. In addition, patient labeling could help prevent serious adverse effects related to the use of the product.</p><p>The Medication Guide is being requested from sponsor due to the new safety information described above, and is will be considered to be part of a REMS. A timetable for submission of assessments of the REMS is also required, and shall be no less frequent than 18 months, 3 years, and 7 years after the REMS is approved.</p><p>The only elements of the REMS will be a Medication Guide and a timetable for submission of assessments of the REMS.</p></div>

We recommend that each packaging configuration contain enough Medication Guides so that one is provided for each "usual" or average dose. For example:</p><p>• A minimum of four Medication Guides would be provided with a bottle of 100 for a product where the usual or average dose is 1 capsule/tablet daily, thus a monthly supply is 30 tablets.</p><p>• A minimum of one Medication Guide would be provided with unit of use where it is expected that all tablets/capsules would be supplied to the patient.</p><p>3. The timetable for submission of assessments will be at minimum at 18 months, 3 years and within the 7th year following the approval of the REMS.</p><p>• The REMS assessments should include information needed to assess the effectiveness of the REMS including:</p><p>• Patients' understanding of the serious risks of Symbyax (olanzapine and fluoxetine hydrochloride) • A report on periodic assessments of the distribution and dispensing of the Medication Guide in accordance with 21 CFR 208.24 • A report on failures to adhere to distribution and dispensing requirements, and corrective actions taken to address noncompliance • If you feel the REMS assessment at 7 years of the patient's understanding of the Medication Guide is not needed because you have determined that serious risks have been adequately identified and assessed, submit a modification to the REMS following the REMS 3 year assessment. The agency will then determine if additional assessments of the patient's understanding of the Medication Guide are necessary. 4. We recommend submitting a complete description of methodology and the instruments used to measure patient's understanding of the risks and safe use of Symbyax to FDA 60 days prior to conducting the survey. The submission should include:</p><p>o All methodology and instruments that will be used to evaluate the patients' understanding about the safe use of Symbyax (olanzapine and fluoxetine hydrochloride). This should include, but not be limited to:</p><p>Sample size and confidence associated with that sample size How the sample will be determined (selection criteria) The expected number of patients to be surveyed <ref type="figure">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</ref> </p></div>

Nevertheless, we don't have any objections to what has been proposed, either for the letter or labeling. However, we do think the labeling would be improved by the addition of language regarding hyperglycemia and potential weight gain in the Information for Patients section of the labeling. <ref type="bibr">Grewal,</ref><ref type="bibr">Pharm.D.,</ref><ref type="bibr">LCDR USPHS Regulatory Project Manager Division of Psychiatry Products Center For Drug Evaluation and Research,</ref><ref type="bibr">FDA Office of Drug Evaluation I Ph: (301)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">796-1080 Email: renmeet.grewal@fda.hhs.gov Fax: (301)</ref>  <ref type="figure">796-9838   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is a representation of an electronic record that was signed electronically and  this page is the manifestation of the electronic signature.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</ref> We do not consider these submissions to be complete responses to our March 28, 2007 and April 30, 2007 action letters. Therefore, we will not start the review clocks until we receive a complete response. The following deficiencies from our action letters still need to be addressed:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thank you, Rimmy</head><p>As we noted in our action letters, a primary concern with these applications is that we lack important safety information related to hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and weight gain, in order to adequately update the labeling with all relevant risk information. As we stated in the letters, we need you to address these concerns, including the provision of pertinent data and analyses, before we will be able to take a final action on these applications. We referenced then, and again refer to, our letter dated January 12, 2007 regarding New York Times coverage of these issues.</p><p>We note that your resubmissions include only the requested information that relates to placebo controlled fasting/nonfasting adult and adolescent analyses. You have indicated that other information related to these issues remains outstanding and is slated for submission in September As was discussed in our meeting of May 24, 2007 related to NDA 21-520 S-012, a rolling timetable of submissions is acceptable, and we will consider after each such submission whether or not it can be considered to represent a complete response. However, upon receipt of the first portion of data, we NDA 20-592 / S-040 Page 2 NDA 20-592 / S-041 NDA 21-520 / S-012 have determined that review of certain of the analyses targeted for later completion will in fact be necessary before adequate labeling pertaining to metabolic effects can be drafted. In particular, we will need to receive the data slated for submission in December, 2007, i.e., the long-term integrated database information for adult and adolescent use of olanzapine. It is not possible for us to adequately assess the safety of olanzapine with respect to the three metabolic issues noted above, until we have received this additional information requested in our <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">March 28, 2007 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">April 30, 2007 action letters.</ref> Although the first portion of data in the current submission does contain some long-term data, most of the metabolic data related to long-term exposure to olanzapine will be available in the long-term integrated database. Data pertaining to the metabolic effects of olanzapine over the longer term are necessary to fully and adequately characterize its metabolic effects. Therefore, your submissions will not be considered complete until we have received this outstanding information.</p><p>You must make separate submissions to NDA 21-520 / S-012 and NDA 20-592 / S-040 and S-041 when responding to this letter.</p><p>All applications for new active ingredients, new dosage forms, new indications, new routes of administration, and new dosing regimens are required to contain an assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the product in pediatric patients unless this requirement is waived or deferred. We note that these supplemental applications for Zyprexa tablets are pediatric submissions in fulfillment of the requirement. Please refer to our April 30, 2007 action letter for further details.</p><p>If you have any questions, call Doris Bates, Regulatory Project Manager, at (301) 796-1040, or contact her via secure electronic mail at doris.bates@fda.hhs.gov, with respect to NDA 20-592 S-040 and S-041; for any questions relevant to NDA 21-520 S-012, contact LCDR Renmeet Grewal, Regulatory Project Manager, at (301) 796-1080, or contact her via secure electronic mail at renmeet.grewal@fda.hhs.gov .</p></div>

Serum prolactin levels were not measured during the olanzapine carcinogenicity studies; however, 196 measurements during subchronic toxicity studies showed that olanzapine elevated serum prolactin levels up to 4-fold in rats at the 197 same doses used in the carcinogenicity study. An increase in mammary gland neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic 198 administration of other antipsychotic drugs. and is considered to be prolactin-mediated.
