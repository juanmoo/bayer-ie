<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Recommendation on Regulatory Action</head><p>This reviewer recommends approval of Cosentyx (secukinumab) as indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. This reviewer is recommending approval of both the 150 mg dose and the 300 mg dose by subcutaneous injection with initial dosing at Weeks 0, 1, 2, and 3 followed by maintenance dosing every 4 weeks starting at Week 4. BLA 125504 supports approval of three presentations: 150 mg/mL in a single-use prefilled SensoReady pen for injection, 150 mg/mL in a single-use prefilled syringe for injection, and 150 mg powder for solution in a single-use vial for injection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Risk Benefit Assessment</head><p>The Applicant is seeking approval for a secukinumab dose of 300 mg by SC injection with initial dosing at Weeks 0, 1, 2, and 3 followed by monthly dosing starting at Week 4. Secukinumab (AIN457) 300 mg and 150 mg doses in lyophilisate in vial (LYO) were both demonstrated to be superior to placebo in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in two Phase 3 trials (2302 and 2303). The trials enrolled subjects 18 years of age and older who had plaque-type psoriasis with a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score ≥12, an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of at least 3, and body surface area (BSA) involvement ≥10% at baseline. Trial subjects randomized to receive secukinumab received injections once a week for the first 4 weeks and then once every 4 weeks through Week 52.</p><p>The overall study population in the psoriasis development program was representative of the target patient population of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of subjects achieving PASI 75 response (i.e., ≥ 75% reduction in PASI score) at Week 12 and scoring IGA 0 or 1 at Week 12, with a secondary endpoint of PASI 90 response (i.e., ≥ 90% reduction in PASI score) at Week 12. Both secukinumab 300 mg and 150 mg were superior to placebo (p&lt;0.0001) for the co-primary endpoints of PASI 75and IGA of 0 or 1, as well as the secondary endpoint of PASI 90 in each of the pivotal trials.</p><p>For the co-primary endpoints, secukinumab 300 mg showed a higher response (approximately 10%) than those of the 150 mg dose for the co-primary endpoints.</p><p>Clinical Review Amy S. Woitach,  10</p><p>The number of individuals exposed to secukinumab in the BLA trials exceeds ICH guidelines, and is adequate for Agency evaluation of safety in subjects with psoriasis. Novartis reported that 3430 psoriasis subjects were exposed to at least one dose of secukinumab (1395 subjects on 150 mg and 1410 subjects on 300 mg). 2751 subjects treated for at least 6 months and 1641 subjects treated for at least 1 year. Investigators exposed reasonable numbers of subjects to the proposed dose (300 mg loading dose at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8) 690 subjects on 300 mg. An additional 692 subjects were exposed to a loading dose of 150 mg. The majority of the subjects continued maintenance dosing every 4 weeks until Week 48. Long term studies are ongoing.</p><p>The safety data from the secukinumab development program for psoriasis identified the profile of a biologic immunosuppressant therapy associated with inherent risks, such as serious infections and effects on leukocytes. The overall safety profile appears to be similar to other biologic products approved for the treatment of plaque psoriasis.</p><p>The 300 mg dose appears to be slightly more effective than the treatment effect observed in the 150 mg cohort. However, at the increased dose, systemic exposure is increased. This reviewer finds that the minimum therapeutically effective dose would be clinically optimal for a subset of patients given that the safety risks of this therapeutic biologic for long term use are not yet fully characterized. Doubling the dose and increasing systemic exposure (and the potential risks that higher exposure may convey over time) is not necessary for a significant number of patients to achieve success and for a subset of the study population, the risk/ benefit is more favorable for the 150mg dose than for the 300 mg dose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Recommendations for Postmarket Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies</head><p>Risk mitigation measures beyond professional labeling are not warranted for secukinumab at this time. Based on the known safety profile for the drug class and the risks associated with secukinumab from the clinical trials, the benefit-risk profile is acceptable and can be mitigated through the professional labeling.</p><p>A proposed REMS was voluntarily submitted by Novartis on October 22, 2013, as part of the original submission. The proposed REMS has the goal of communicating to healthcare professionals and pharmacists the risk of infections associated with secukinumab treatment and consists of a communication plan (CP) (Dear Healthcare Professional and Dear Pharmacist letters, and Letters to Professional Societies for prescribers and pharmacists), and a timetable for submission of assessments.</p><p>Medications infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept, which had REMS programs that were most similar to that proposed for secukinumab (risk of infection), had their REMS released after the REMS CP requirements were complete and the REMS assessment Clinical Review Amy S. Woitach, DO BLA 125-504 Cosentyx (secukinumab) 11 showed that healthcare professionals understood the key messages regarding ILs and risk of infection.</p><p>The Division of Risk Management's (DRISK) evaluation of the proposed risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) for BLA 125504 concludes that there will be a baseline familiarity with the management of the risks associated with this medication. DRISK believes that the prescriber population will use the knowledge gained through the aforementioned REMS regarding the risk of infection and apply it to managing patients prescribed secukinumab. See Felicia Duffy's 10/7/14 review for details of the evaluation.</p><p>This reviewer concurs with DRISK's recommendation that a REMS for this product is not necessary at this time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Recommendations for Postmarket Requirements and Commitments</head><p>The risk of malignancy in patients is a safety concern for immunosuppressive drugs in general. Because it is unlikely that short premarket trials would detect rare events with long latency such as malignancy, this reviewer recommends a post-marketing assessment of malignancy. The applicant is proposing to enroll subjects in a multicenter, longitudinal, observational disease registry to collect and analyze data on incidence and nature of malignancies. This reviewer finds this approach reasonable.</p><p>In addition to malignancy, registries for precedent products also followed for the occurrence of serious infection, tuberculosis, opportunistic infections, hypersensitivity reactions, autoimmune disease, neurologic or demyelinating disease, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal or hematologic adverse events and pregnancy exposure. However, it is this reviewer's opinion that these events can be assessed similarly through evaluation of data from long-term extension studies and reports of post-marketing events. Enhanced pharmacovigilance is recommended for the post-marketing phase for this product to further assess longer term safety outcomes.</p><p>If secukinumab is approved for treatment of plaque psoriasis, this reviewer recommends postmarketing requirements included:</p><p> Long term safety studies which included the proposed disease registry and continuation of the ongoing long-term extension trials.  Studies to achieve compliance with PREA 2 Introduction and Regulatory Background Phototherapy This therapy involves exposures to UVB (including narrowband) or to UVA in combination with the photosensitizer, Psoralen, a photochemotherapy that goes by the acronym PUVA. Phototherapy requires frequent office visits (e.g. three times per week) and carries an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma (of the skin).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Availability of Proposed Active Ingredient in the United States</head><p>The product is not available in the United States. At the time of submission secukinumab is not marketed globally. The applicant is concurrently seeking global marketing authority.</p><p>On 20 November 2014, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Cosentyx powder for solution for injection, solution for injection in pre-filled pen, solution for injection in pre-filled syringe intended for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Important Safety Issues with Consideration to Related Drugs</head><p>Potential risks based on class of drug (anti-cytokine) and of the drug substance (foreign protein) were considered. Potential risks associated with immunomodulating biologic therapies may include infections, cardiovascular/cerebrovascular safety, malignancies and autoimmune disorders. Potential risks of a foreign protein may include administration or immune reactions, such as hypersensitivity, injection site/infusion reactions and immunogenicity.</p><p>Of note 2 biologics previously approved for the treatment of psoriasis have been voluntarily withdrawn from the market: Alefacept, an inhibitor of LFA-3/CD2 interaction which carried warnings for lymphopenia, serious infections, and malignancy; Efalizumab, which binds CD11a and was voluntary withdrawn based on the finding of an association with the use of efalizumab and an increased risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) approximately 5.5 years after approval. The Clinical Review Amy S. Woitach, DO BLA 125-504 Cosentyx (secukinumab) 14 relevance of these products to secukinumab is unclear since neither product directly targeted IL-17.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Summary of Presubmission Regulatory Activity Related to Submission</head><p>The applicant requested an End of Phase 2 meeting held on 3/2/11 which was granted as a guidance meeting because Phase 2 trials were ongoing. The package included summaries of Phase 1 and 2 studies as well as two pivotal Phase 3 protocol synopses (CAIN457A2302, CAIN457A2303) and other phase 3 studies (CAIN457A2304, CAIN457A2307) for which the Agency provided general comments. Despite Agency recommendations for further Phase 2 development, the sponsor has elected to move into Phase 3. The pivotal trials are being conducted with the lyophilized powder formulation and were not submitted for a special protocol assessment (SPA).</p><p>The above protocols and their protocol amendments in addition to protocols to evaluate the pre-filled syringe formulation (CAIN457A2308) and the autoinjector/ prefilled syringe configuration (CAIN457A2309) have been the subject of several Agency reviews and comments were conveyed.</p><p>The Agency has also held discussions with the applicant regarding a human factor study on the autoinjector and patient reported outcomes. The applicant submitted an initial Pediatric Study Plan to address PREA (see section 7.6.3 Pediatrics and Assessment of Effects on Growth).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Other Relevant Background Information</head><p>Study CAIN457A2303 used both <ref type="bibr">EU-sourced Enbrel (etanercept)</ref> as an active comparator product to secukinumab, the primary drug under investigation. Because EUsourced Enbrel is considered an investigative product in the US, this study was conducted under a separate <ref type="bibr">IND (113,</ref><ref type="bibr">021)</ref>. Within IND 113,021 exists a cross reference to IND 100,418 which currently contains all relevant information for the psoriasis indication for secukinumab.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Submission Quality and Integrity</head><p>The clinical site of Drs. Papp and Szepietowski were selected for inspection because they were among the larger enrolling sites and study treatment exhibited somewhat greater efficacy than most other sites. OSI has determined that regarding both sites, the study appears to have been conducted adequately, and the data generated by these sites appear acceptable in support of the respective indication. The clinical site of Dr. Bardur Sigurgeirsson was selected and inspected independently by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The findings of the inspection are based on the Integrated Inspection Report shared by the EMA with FDA. Having reviewed EMA's inspection report on the conduct of Protocol CAIN457A2303 at Dr. Sigurgeirsson's site, OSI is in agreement that the data generated by this site appear acceptable in support of the respective indication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Compliance with Good Clinical Practices</head><p>The applicant stated in the NDA submission that the studies were conducted in compliance with the ethical principles originating in or derived from the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with all International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines. In addition, all local regulatory requirements were followed; in particular, those affording greater protection to the safety of study participants. Written informed consent was obtained prior to the subject entering the studies. This reviewer did not find information to indicate that good clinical practices were not followed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls</head><p>The Office of Biotechnology Products, OPS, CDER, recommends approval (see CMC reviews by Drs. Camilli and Kennett). The product is free of endogenous and adventitious infectious agents sufficient to meet the parameters recommended by FDA. The conditions used in manufacturing have been sufficiently validated, and a consistent product has been manufactured from multiple production runs. It is recommended that Cosentyx (secukinumab) be approved for human use (under conditions specified in the package insert). OBP also recommends the following Post-Marketing Commitments:</p><p>To re-evaluate secukinumab lot release and stability specifications after 30 lots have been manufactured using the commercial manufacturing process for  drug substance Repeat dose toxicity studies in monkeys indicated secukinumab was well tolerated at the injection site with no treatment-related pathology changes during the 26-week treatment and 13-week recovery period. Due to clinical chemistry effects and immunotoxicity (decreases in total lymphocytes, B cells and T cells) observed at the high dose, the NOAEL appears to be 50 mg/kg/week. Clinical dosing at 1/10th the NOAEL (300 mg/60 kg = 5 mg/kg) did not significantly decrease total lymphocytes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Clinical Pharmacology</head><p>From a Clinical Pharmacology standpoint, the review team finds the BLA is acceptable for approval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.1">Mechanism of Action</head><p>Secukinumab binds to the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and inhibits its interaction with the IL-17 receptor. IL-17A is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in the normal inflammatory and immune responses and plays a role in the pathogenesis of plaque psoriasis.</p><p>While the applicant purports that IL 17A is highly upregulated in lesional skin in contrast to non-lesional skin of plaque psoriasis patients, the clinical significance of this finding is The Clinical Pharmacology review team recommends that the Applicant provides additional clinical experience with the AI presentation in the ongoing clinical study(ies) in lieu of a dedicated study comparing exposures between the AI and LYO presentations.</p><p>Reviewer comment: The PK differences between the AI and LYO presentations as seen by cross-study comparisons have been discussed between the clinical and clinical pharmacology teams. Given the limitations of cross-study comparisons and overlapping exposures, it is not clear to this reviewer if this represents a meaningful difference in exposure, and this has not been correlated to any demonstrated safety risk. The efficacy data for the 300 mg dose may support a difference in exposure; there does not appear to be a meaningful difference in safety based on cross-comparisons of LYO and AI at 12 weeks. However, given the short duration and the small number of subjects in the study evaluating the AI (trial 2309) the interpretation is limited. This reviewer does not conclude that a larger clinical trial evaluating the safety of the AI would provide substantially useful safety information and recommends monitoring for safety differences between the AI and LYO presentations in the ongoing LTE trials and in postmarketing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Sources of Clinical Data</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Tables of Studies/Clinical Trials</head><p>The proposed indication is supported by the 52-week safety and efficacy data from the Phase 3 trials CAIN457A2302, CAIN457A2303, (hereafter referred to as 2302 and 2303, respectively) and 12-week safety and efficacy data from the Phase 3 trials CAIN457A2308, and CAIN457A 2309 (hereafter referred to as 2308 and 2309). An additional 6 Phase 2/3 trials have been conducted in psoriasis. Safety update reports were also provided in support of the current application.</p><p>Trials 2302, 2303, 2308 and 2309 were similarly designed to assess two secukinumab doses (150 mg and 300 mg). Trial 2303 included an active comparator arm with a non-US approved biologic (EU-approved Etanercept). Efficacy comparisons between secukinumab and the active comparator will not be discussed by this reviewer since without a demonstration of comparability between EU and US etanercept and without a confirmatory second study, comparability claims cannot be supported for labeling.</p><p>Three presentations of secukinumab: lyophilisate in vial (LYO), liquid in pre-filled syringe (PFS), and liquid in pen/autoinjector (AI) were evaluated. All psoriasis trials were conducted in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Six phase 3 psoriasis trials were completed and summarized in the The Applicant is seeking approval for a secukinumab dose of 300 mg by SC injection with initial dosing at Weeks 0, 1, 2, and 3 followed by monthly dosing starting at Week 4. Each 300 mg dose is given as 2 150 mg SC injections with one of the following proposed formulation and presentations: ̶ Injection: 150 mg/mL in a single-use prefilled SensoReady pen (AI, autoinjector) ̶ Injection: 150 mg/mL in a single-use prefilled syringe (PFS) ̶ Injection, powder for solution: 150 mg in a single-use vial (LYO)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Review Strategy</head><p>The results of the first 12 weeks of treatment were the primary source of efficacy data. The efficacy data from 12 to 52 weeks were reviewed primarily to support that any efficacy in the first 12 weeks was sustained to 52 weeks.</p><p>The safety review will primarily focus on safety data through Week 52 from Trials 2302 and 2303 and data through Week 12 from the Trials 2308 and 2309. Additional analyses were conducted on AEs of special interest based on safety issues seen in related drugs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Discussion of Individual Studies/Clinical Trials</head><p>The 2 pivotal trials to support approval, 2302 and 2303, are described here.</p></div>

While subjects were scheduled to be dosed once every four weeks from Weeks 12 to 48 for maintenance, during Weeks 13, 14, 15, subjects received a weekly dose of placebo to maintain blinding because nonresponders from the placebo group that were re-randomized at Week 12 to either secukinumab 150 mg or 300 mg received weekly injections at Week 12, 13, 14, 15 followed by injections once every four weeks from Week 16 to Week 48.</p><p>For the maintenance period, only those subjects in the placebo group will be rerandomized depending on the PASI75 response at Week 12:</p><p>• PASI 75 responders at Week 12: continue on placebo • PASI 75 nonresponders at Week 12: re-randomized 1:1 to 150 mg or 300 mg At the end of maintenance period, qualifying subjects in the active treatment groups during the maintenance period entered an extension study designed to investigate longterm efficacy and safety of treatment with secukinumab.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Review of Efficacy</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Summary</head><p>Secukinumab (AIN457) 300 mg and 150 mg in lyophilisate in vial (LYO) were superior to placebo in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in two Phase 3 trials (2302 and 2303). The trials enrolled subjects 18 years of age and older who had plaque-type psoriasis with a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score ≥12, an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of at least 3, and body surface area (BSA) involvement ≥10% at baseline. Trial subjects randomized to receive secukinumab received injections once a week for the first 4 weeks and then once every 4 weeks through Week 52.</p><p>The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of subjects achieving PASI 75 response (i.e., ≥ 75% reduction in PASI score) at Week 12 and scoring IGA 0 or 1 at Week 12, with a secondary endpoint of PASI 90 response (i.e., ≥ 90% reduction in PASI score) at Week 12. Both secukinumab 300 mg and 150 mg were superior to placebo (p&lt;0.0001) for the co-primary endpoints of PASI 75and IGA of 0 or 1, as well as the secondary endpoint of PASI 90 in each of the pivotal trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Indication</head><p>Treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy In study 2303, the applicant included a non-US licensed active comparator (EU approved etanercept) study arm. At the beginning of application review, it was determined that the team would not consider data relating to the active comparator for labeling as these results were not replicated in a second trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2">Demographics</head><p>The baseline demographics were generally balanced across the treatment arms for the two pivotal trials (2302 and 2303). Approximately 70% of the subjects were male and 30% were female in both trials, approximately 68% were Caucasians and the mean age was around 45 years. The mean weight was about 88 kg in Trial 2302 and 83 kg in Trial 2303. The table below presents the baseline demographics for the pivotal trials (2302 and 2303). The predominant race in the trials is Caucasian which is consistent with the disease prevalence by race. The genetic components involved in psoriasis are complex and race is likely to be an indicator of genetic background. However, this reviewer has not been able to identify literature reports describing differential responses to previously approved psoriasis treatments based on race. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that secukinumab would likely be effective across underrepresented races.</p><p>The baseline disease characteristics of IGA, PASI and BSA were generally balanced across treatment groups in Trials 2302 and 2303. Approximately 62% of subjects had a baseline IGA of 3 (moderate), and the rest of the subjects had a baseline IGA of 4 (severe). The mean PASI score was about 23 (the minimum for inclusion was a PASI score of 12). The table below shows the baseline disease severity for the pivotal trials. For the pivotal studies, approximately 6% of subjects had missing data at the Week 12 visit, and per the protocol-specified primary imputation method, these subjects were treated as nonresponse for the efficacy analyses. With such low rates of missing data along with the large treatment effect, the impact of the imputation method on efficacy is minimal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.4">Analysis of Primary Endpoint(s)</head><p>The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of subjects achieving PASI 75 response (i.e., ≥ 75% reduction in PASI score) at Week 12 and scoring IGA 0 or 1 at Week 12, The table below summarizes the efficacy results for the co-primary endpoints for the two Phase 3 trials. Both secukinumab 300 mg and 150 mg were superior to placebo (p&lt;0.0001) for the coprimary endpoints of PASI 75 response and IGA of 0 or 1 in each of the pivotal trials.</p><p>Reviewer comment: Although the 300 mg dose demonstrates better efficacy than the 150 mg when comparing study populations, a significant number of individual subjects achieve success at the lower dose. This reviewer finds that the minimum therapeutically effective dose would be optimal for a subset of patients given that the safety risks of this therapeutic biologic for long term use are not yet fully characterized. Ways to define the population who would benefit from the lower dose were explored and are presented in section 6.1.8 Analysis of Clinical Information Relevant to Dosing Recommendations below.</p><p>In addition to trials 2302 and 2303, two Phase 3 trials to support the safety and efficacy of secukinumab presentations prefilled syringe (2308) and autoinjector (2309) were conducted using the same co-primary endpoints. The table below shows the results of the co-primary endpoints at Week 12 for Trials 2308 and 2309. The results of the co-primary efficacy endpoints were statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001).</p><p>While the trials showed that the PFS and AI presentations were superior to placebo, the trials were not designed to address how the efficacies compare to those of the original LYO formulation of secukinumab. However, in comparing the efficacy results across trials, the response rates in Trials 2308 and 2309 were generally similar to those of trials 2302 and 2303. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>27</head><p> maintenance of IGA 0 or 1 response after 52 weeks of treatment.</p><p>No maintenance comparisons of secukinumab could be made against the placebo arm because there was no placebo arm for the maintenance period. Thus, only a comparison for PASI 90 is shown in the table below. Patient reported outcomes (PRO) on itching, pain, and scaling were included as prespecified secondary endpoints. However, not all centers had the Psoriasis Diary device available and subjects could elect not to use the device at sites where the device was available. As a result, approximately 40% of subjects from each trial participated in assessing the PRO responses on itching, pain, and scaling. Protocols did not call for minimum baseline itch, pain, scaling severities as inclusion criteria. As such, the level of itching, pain and scaling at baseline varied widely from no symptoms (i.e., score of 0) to severe symptoms (i.e., score of 10). The mean PRO scores for itching, pain, and scaling at baseline, as well as the mean score for each PRO by baseline IGA severity, and by IGA response (i.e., success or failure) at Week 12 are summarized in the biostatistical review.</p><p>Mean pain, itch and scaling scores at baseline generally correlated with IGA severity (i.e. higher for an IGA=4 than IGA=3).</p><p>In conclusion, for those subjects that reported the PROs, the improvement in the severity of psoriasis disease severity also led to the improvement in itching, pain, and scaling. This was even the case for the subjects who were of IGA failures, although the improvements were smaller in magnitude compared to those of the IGA successes. while the secukinumab 300 mg dose yielded higher IGA success rates compared to those of the 150 mg dose, the responses for itching, pain and scaling at Week 12 across the two secukinumab doses were similar. In addition, while the IGA as well as PASI 75 responses at Week 12 for the secukinumab doses were almost double the response as those for the etanercept, the itch responses at Week 12 for the secukinumab doses are only slightly higher in comparison to those for etanercept group.</p><p>The proposed PRO labeling claim is improvements in itching, pain, and scaling at Week 12 compared with placebo. The applicants proposed labeling is as follows:</p><p>improvements in signs and symptoms related to itching, pain, and scaling at week 12 compared to placebo (Studies 1 &amp; 2) were using the Psoriasis Symptom Diary.</p><p>Reviewer comment: The instrument to assess the PROs has been deemed valid. However, the robustness of this assessment from a statistical perspective is not ideal. The comparisons of the PRO endpoints were added to the testing strategy as secondary endpoints in the amended protocol. Only a subset of subjects participated in the PRO diary assessments. Therefore,, it is not clear whether the findings from these endpoints are generalizable to the overall population because the subset assessed may not encompass a random sample of the total population. The signs and symptoms of itching, pain and scaling are reasonably correlated with the disease. It is this reviewer's opinion that these are not clinically meaningful as they do not add information on the patient experience which can be the target of therapeutic The table below presents the IGA 0 or 1 success by gender, race, age, and weight strata at baseline for the pivotal trials. Efficacy responses were generally similar by subgroup analysis. Some lower responses were seen by race (Asian) and age (&gt;65) in trial 2303. However this is likely due to fewer numbers of subjects enrolled. The efficacy and safety of secukinumab evaluated in Phase 3 trials included two doses of secukinumab (150 mg or 300 mg). The efficacy results overall showed that both 150 mg and 300 mg doses of secukinumab are highly efficacious compared to placebo, however, a greater number of responders was shown in favor of the 300 mg dose compared to the 150 mg dose. See <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 6</ref> above.</p><p>Bodyweight was identified as the major covariate significantly influencing secukinumab exposure. As shown in the clinical pharmacology review, multiple analyses support the role of higher secukinumab exposure as a significant factor in achieving a higher PASI 75 or IGA 0/1 response. Thus, bodyweight has an impact on efficacy response. Within each secukinumab dose group (150 mg or 300 mg), the trough concentrations of secukinumab and clinical response rates were generally higher in the lower body weight group as shown in the figure below.   Reviewer comment: Subjects of lower bodyweight (&lt;90 kg) were more likely to achieve success than higher bodyweight subjects at the 150 mg dose, yet this patient population saw an increase in response by increasing dose to 300 mg. Therefore, some (albeit a fewer number) of low bodyweight subjects appear to benefit from the higher dose. Although somewhat predictive of response, bodyweight does not appear to be the only factor.</p><p>It remains this reviewer's position that doubling the dose (and the potential risks that higher exposure may convey over time) is not necessary for a significant number of patients to achieve clinical success and there is value in prescribers understanding that option and the data behind this recommendation. Based on the conducted studies, it is difficult to define a population other than one based on weight for which the higher dose may be needed. It is not this reviewer's intent to limit access to those who would benefit from the 300 mg dose. However, it is very unlikely that the safety profile for secukinumab across a broader patient population has been fully characterized at this Clinical Review Amy S. Woitach, DO BLA 125-504 Cosentyx (secukinumab) 32 juncture. Also, the effect of exposure on potential risks in a broader population is not known. For a subset of the study population, the risk/ benefit is more favorable for the 150mg dose than for the 300 mg dose.</p><p>Based on the correlation of bodyweight and efficacy the clinical pharmacology team is recommending the following PMC:</p><p>To explore a higher dosing regimen for the subgroup of subjects with higher body weight We recommend that the Applicant explores a higher dose (e.g., 450 mg) of secukinumab in psoriasis subjects with higher body weight (e.g., ≥90 kg) and evaluate the treatment effects and safety profiles in this subgroup to provide an option for those who cannot achieve the therapeutic goal at 300 mg dose. This recommendation is based on the lower observed clinical response rates (by approximately 10% with respect to both PASI 75 and IGA 0/1) in subjects with body weight ≥90 kg than those in subjects with body weight &lt;90 kg at the recommended 300 mg dose where no safety concerns were observed. Simulations with the population PK model indicate that the secukinumab dose of 450 mg administered to subjects with body weight ≥90 kg would achieve a similar exposure as the recommended 300 mg dose in subjects with body weight &lt;90 kg.</p><p>Reviewer comment: Because efficacy appears to correlate with exposure and body weight is a major determinant of exposure, it is reasonable to this reviewer that some patients of some higher body weight will benefit from a dose greater than 300 mg. Additionally, the exposure would not be expected to increase for these patients since it appears to correlate with bodyweight. This reviewer agrees with further evaluation to maximizing efficacy based on bodyweight. However, it is not clear to this reviewer as to which weight cut-off should be evaluated. Based on current data &gt;90 kg may be a reasonable starting point that is supported by the exposure data from subjects &lt;90 mg treated with the 300 mg dose. However, should additional dose-dependent safety risks arise, this weight cut-off may need to be raised. Trials that explore additional dose ranging information would be useful and this recommendation should be communicated to the applicant. However it is not clear to this reviewer that such a trial should be an obligation for the applicant until long term safety at the higher exposure (e.g. as seen in&lt;90 mg patients treated with the 300 mg dose)is better characterized.   A slight decline is noted in the response over time. It is not clear whether this is due to an actual loss of response or to missing data imputed as failures. The IGA and the PASI 75 responses were generally higher for the secukinumab 300 mg group compared to those of the secukinumab 150 mg group. Also noted is that subjects who were initially on placebo for the induction period had slightly higher response as compared to subjects on the same dose over the entire treatment period.</p></div>

In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, a total of 843 subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis from about 133 global study sites were enrolled. Men or women who are ≥18 of age, PASI score ≥12, IGA score of at least 3, and BSA involvement ≥10% at baseline were randomized in a 1:1 Subjects received treatment at randomization, Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8 with assessment at Week 12. Based on the Week 12 PASI 75 responses, these subjects were then rerandomized to one of the two maintenance treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio:  Fixed Interval (FI) -the same dose as in the induction period every 4 weeks from Weeks 12 to 48  Retreatment at Start at Relapse (SoR) where SoR was defined as "a loss of ≥20% of the maximum PASI gain achieved during the study compared to baseline, and a loss of PASI 75 response". Whenever a subject fulfilled the start of relapse criteria, active secukinumab were administered at their scheduled visits until the subject was back to PASI 75 response.</p><p>Subjects who finished the maintenance period entered the treatment-free follow-up period with visits on Weeks 56 and 60. The study design is shown below. For the primary endpoint for Trial 2304 was defined as below:  FI regimens -PASI75 response at Week 52  SoR regimens -PASI 75 response at: -Week 52 for subjects who qualified for active treatment at Week 40 and -Week 40 for subjects who did not qualify for active treatment at Week 40 The sponsor conducted non-inferiority testing of the retreatment at SoR regimen vs. the FI regimen using a non-inferiority margin (Δ) of 15%. </p></div>

Approximately 91% of subjects completed the 52-week maintenance period, and the discontinuation rate was highest for the 150 mg SoR arm (12%) compared to the other treatment arms (about 8%). The most common reason for discontinuation was subject/guardian decision (4%), and the rates were similar for 150 mg SoR and 150 mg FI, and also for 300 mg SoR and 300 mg FI arms. The discontinuation rate due to adverse events was highest for the 300 mg FI arm compared to the rest of the arms.</p><p>A comparison of the PASI 75 response rates of the retreatment at SoR regimen to the retreatment at FI regimen showed point estimates were about -10% different between the SoR and the FI regimens; however, the lower limit of the confidence interval was -20% which exceeded the prespecified -15% margin.

The applicant is not proposing labeling claims based on this trial Although this reviewer finds that information on randomized withdrawal would be useful to prescribers in titrating therapy, without a demonstration of non-inferiority, it is unclear how this information could guide the use of secukinumab differently than current medical management of biologic therapy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Summary</head><p>This review considers the safety data for Cosentyx (secukinumab) as presented in BLA 125504.The number of individuals exposed to secukinumab in the BLA trials exceeds ICH guidelines, and is adequate for Agency evaluation of safety in subjects with psoriasis. Novartis reported that 3430 psoriasis subjects were exposed to at least one dose of secukinumab (1395 subjects on 150 mg and 1410 subjects on 300 mg). 2751 subjects treated for at least 6 months and 1641 subjects treated for at least 1 year.</p><p>Investigators exposed reasonable numbers of subjects to the proposed dose (300 mg loading dose at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8) 690 subjects on 300 mg. An additional 692 subjects were exposed to a loading dose of 150 mg. The majority of the subjects continued maintenance dosing every 4 weeks until Week 48. Long term studies are ongoing. There were no notable inconsistencies across the data sources (summaries, reports, data sets, etc.). The routine safety monitoring in the clinical trials seemed appropriate and capable of identifying major safety signals with secukinumab.</p><p>Deaths occurred infrequently in the clinical trials and the safety data did not suggest an increased mortality risk in subjects exposed to secukinumab. In reviewing the individual narratives for deaths in patients exposed to secukinumab, there did not appear to be treatment-related causes of death.</p><p>In general, this reviewer agrees with the applicant's safety assessments. The overall safety profile appears to be similar to other biologic products approved for the treatment of plaque psoriasis. Given the efficacy results described in the previous section, this reviewer concludes that the applicant has provided a positive risk benefit analysis for secukinumab in this application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Methods</head><p>This section will primarily focus on review of the safety data through Week 52 from Trials 2302 and 2303 and data through Week 12 from the Trials 2308 and 2309. Data in individual trials 2302 and 2303, the largest trials was reviewed individually and as part of pooled data. As the trial designs were similar, the safety analysis was conducted by pooling the safety data at 12 weeks and 52 weeks. Follow-up safety data provided in the Safety Update Report was also reviewed. Primary safety analyses evaluated treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), severe and lifethreatening AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, deaths and laboratory abnormalities in the Phase 3 trials. Additional analyses of AEs of special interest were conducted. These were chosen based on AEs seen with similar precedent immunomodulatory products.</p><p>In study 2303, the applicant included a non-US licensed active comparator (EU approved etanercept) study arm. At the beginning of application review, it was determined that the team would not consider data relating to the active comparator for labeling as these results were not replicated in a second trial. This review will not describe safety comparisons between secukinumab and the non-US licensed active comparator in detail. This reviewer used the safety outcome from the active etanercept comparator to provide a general context for some of the AEs known to occur with the use of TNF-alpha inhibitors.</p><p>Safety comparisons between active and placebo arms were consistent through the primary endpoint time point of 12 weeks, but diverged in longer term extension assessments. There are differing sample sizes between the active and placebo arms as well as differing durations of therapy for many patients as time progressed over the 52 weeks of follow-up in long term extension trials. Placebo patients experienced high Clinical Review Amy S. Woitach, DO BLA 125-504 Cosentyx (secukinumab) 39 efficacy failure rates and dropout rates, and could be placed on active therapy in extension trials. Thus, the numbers of placebo patients became quite small. Exposureadjusted analysis was used to assess safety beyond 12 weeks.</p><p>Studies 2308 and 2309 were conducted as supportive studies which evaluated the PFS and AI presentations. The studies are small (subjects for 2308 and for 2309) and the safety data submitted was of 12 week duration. The safety of the PFS and AI will be based primarily on the results from the pivotal studies. Trials 2308 and 2309 are considered supportive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.1">Studies/Clinical Trials Used to Evaluate Safety</head><p>At the time of BLA submission, 5044 subjects were enrolled in 34 trials evaluating secukinumab for various diseases. 10 of these studies, which included 3993 subjects, were conducted in plaque psoriasis. The psoriasis phase III program was initiated in 2011, and is comprised of six phase III studies <ref type="bibr">(2302,</ref><ref type="bibr">2303,</ref><ref type="bibr">2304,</ref><ref type="bibr">2307,</ref><ref type="bibr">2308,</ref><ref type="bibr">2309)</ref>. Trials assessed three presentations of secukinumab (lyophilisate in vial, liquid in prefilled syringe, and liquid in pen/autoinjector). The four pivotal and 2 additional supportive phase 3 trials in patients with psoriasis are described in the table below. Four Phase 2 trials were performed to support dose selection for Phase 3, only one of which included longer term maintenance therapy (150 mg SC q4w). Study (2204) was excluded from the analysis due to data quality concerns. Specifically, center 0001 enrolled 65/ 80 patients in the trial, but was found to have GCP violations that resulted in the site being closed. Deficiencies included failure to protect blinding, failure to administer study drug infusions as per protocol, and failure to maintain adequate records resulting in underreporting of AEs. The safety results of study 2204 were therefore considered separately and not included in the data pools for this review. The Phase 2 trials are shown in the table below.  between the active and placebo arms and differing durations of therapy, treatment arms were compared using exposure-adjusted rates.</p><p>The applicant provided an additional pooled safety analysis (pool C) of all secukinumab trials which were conducted for various indications. The greater number of subjects in Pool C (N=5044) could increase the likelihood of detecting rare AEs. However, due to population differences, the interpretation of safety risk data in this pooled analysis is limited.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.1">Overall Exposure at Appropriate Doses/Durations and Demographics of Target Populations</head><p>The number of individuals exposed to secukinumab in the BLA trials exceeds ICH guidelines. Novartis reported that 3430 psoriasis subjects were exposed to at least one dose of secukinumab (1395 subjects on 150 mg and 1410 subjects on 300 mg). 2751 subjects treated for at least 6 months and 1641 subjects treated for at least 1 year.</p><p>Investigators exposed reasonable numbers of subjects to the proposed dose (300 mg loading dose at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8), 690 subjects on 300 mg.

Long term studies are ongoing.</p><p>Analysis of the number of injections of active treatment given to subjects in Pool B supports that a reasonable number of subjects were exposed to the 300 mg dose for nearly 1 year. The table below summarizes the distribution of injections by dose.

The median number of active injections was 14 (14 doses) for 150mg and 30 injections (15 doses) for 300 mg. This indicates that approximately 700 subjects received 1 year of treatment for each dose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographics of the target population</head><p>For the overall secukinumab Phase 3 experience, a majority of the subjects were Caucasian (72%), males (70%) and the average age of participants was 44.8 years (with a range of 18-85 years). A summary of the demographic data is below. The Agency analyzed the baseline demographics for the pivotal trials (2302 and 2303). See 9/8/14 Biostatistical Review for Agency analysis. The percentages were similar to the pooled data. The baseline demographics were generally balanced across the treatment arms for the two pivotal trials (2302 and 2303). Subjects were predominantly male, Caucasian and Asian, with an age mean and median in the 5th decade of life.</p><p>The mean weight was about 88 kg in Trial 2302 and 83 kg in Trial 2303.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.2">Explorations for Dose Response</head><p>A range of doses and dosing regimens were explored in Phase 2 studies to explore dose-response. The Phase 2 efficacy data overall supported the selection of the 150 mg dose to be tested in Phase 3 and suggested that early induction doses could achieve a higher clinical response rate at Week 12. The selection of the 300 mg SC dosing regimen for Phase 3 trials was supported by model-based PK simulations. The applicant evaluated 2 doses 150mg and 300 mg in the phase 3 studies. Since two doses were selected for further Phase 3 evaluation, it allowed for further assessment of dose-response in a much larger patient population. Safety data comparing both doses was available for approximately 700 subjects each for maximal duration of dose. Overall, a slightly higher proportion of subjects were exposed to the 150 mg dose because this dose was evaluated in Phase 2 studies (as represented in Pool B).</p><p>52 weeks exposure (with monthly dosing) is the maximal duration of dose studied at the time of application submission. This has been found to be an acceptable pre-market duration of treatment for approval of precedent biologics for the treatment of psoriasis. However, for a chronic disease in which the treatment controls symptoms, but is not curative, long-term safety information is needed and has been shown to provide additional useful safety information. The applicant has proposed to continue open-label extension studies to provide 4 years of additional long term data (A2302E1 and A2304E1) which utilizes the same dosing regimen as Phase 3. These studies are ongoing at the time of this submission. While the data these extension studies provide will not be optimal, this reviewer finds this approach most practical and thus a reasonable way to proceed.</p></div>

The metabolic pathway of secukinumab has not been characterized. It is assumed that as a human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody secukinumab is degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG.</p><p>In subjects with psoriasis, the mean half-life values of secukinumab ranged from 22 to 31 days and the mean apparent clearances values ranged from 0.14 to 0.22 L/day across several clinical trials. The apparent clearance appears to be higher in psoriasis patients than in healthy subjects. Body weight was a significant intrinsic factor for clearance. Secukinumab clearance increases with increasing body weight.</p><p>No formal studies were conducted in subjects with renal impairment. Secukinumab is a human IgG immunoglobulin with large molecular size of approximately150 kDa; therefore, non-degraded secukinumab is unlikely to be filtered by kidney or excreted in urine.</p><p>No formal studies were conducted in subjects with hepatic impairment. Metabolism by CYP enzymes or secretion into bile is generally not a significant contributor to the elimination of IgG antibodies such as secukinumab.</p></div>

Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was elevated at 544.2 and a cardiac ultrasonography on showed normal LV function. The edema was treated with furosemide and antibiotics. The erythrodermic psoriasis was treated with cyclosporine. The subject discontinued study treatment (last dose Day 7) due to the events, which resolved with treatment. The investigator suspected a relationship between the events cardiac failure, pulmonary edema, erythrodermic psoriasis and the study medication.</p><p>Reviewer comment: Dr. Preston Dunnmon, DCRP cardiology finds it unlikely that this case also represents drug-induced congestive heart failure and this reviewer concurs. It is possible that the hypoxia and pulmonary edema is related to erythrodermic psoriasis. Cases of generalized pustular and erythrodermic psoriasis have been reported to be complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 1 . The BNP elevation in the absence left ventricular dysfunction may suggest a non-cardiac cause of the edema such as ARDS 2 . Although the pulmonary edema may be related to erythrodermic psoriasis, it is unlikely that secukinumab caused the erythrodermic psoriasis. The wash out period off of treatment is more likely to be the cause.</p><p>Exposure-adjusted rates per 100 patient-years over the entire treatment period in all psoriasis trials were higher for 300 mg than 150 mg secukinumab (7.4 vs. 6.8). These arms had similar numbers of subjects treated for similar length of duration permitting a more direct comparison. However due to the differing sample sizes between the active and placebo arms as well as differing durations of therapy for many subjects as time progressed over the 52 weeks of follow-up in long term extension trials, a direct comparison between treatment and placebo cannot be made. The best approach, but not without limitations, is to analyze using exposure-adjusted rate. Using this analysis the rate for the 300 mg dose was comparable to placebo (7.4 vs. 7.5).

The majority of the reported AEs of erythrodermic psoriasis were unlikely to be true erythrodermic psoriasis because they were considered nonserious, did not lead to study treatment discontinuation, were of mild or moderate severity, and had low PASI scores, many of which were lower at the time of the event compared with baseline.</p><p>It is unclear why many more subjects reported this AE in the Phase 2 studies as compared to the Phase 3 studies.

Vital signs (VS) were: blood pressure (BP) 114/76 mmHg, pulse 64 bpm, respirations 12bpm. The patient recovered fully from this event the next day. The subject did not receive secukinumab prior to this infusion, and did not have a past history of allergies, including allergic reactions to other drugs.</p><p>Reviewer comment: The occurrence of this anaphylactic event during the administration of secukinumab indicates a likely causal relationship between the anaphylactic reaction and study drug administration. This reviewer concurs with the applicant's proposal for including hypersensitivity reactions in section 5 and 6 of labeling and a contraindication to patients with a severe hypersensitivity reaction to the drug.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Autoimmune events</head><p>The applicant provided search results of autoimmune related adverse events using the Novartis MedDRA Query (NMQ) "Autoimmune Disorders". This NMQ includes a total of 246 preferred terms (PT) covering both systemic and organ-specific autoimmune disorders. This reviewer finds the terms in the query reasonable to search for autoimmune disorders. In both the pooled 12 week analyses (pool A) and pooled data of all psoriasis studies (pool B) autoimmune AEs were reported in a higher proportion of subjects in the placebo dose groups compared with the secukinumab group. Incidence in pool A was 1.0% and 2.0% for 300 mg and 150 mg, respectively, vs. 3.5% for Clinical Review Amy S. Woitach, DO BLA 125-504 Cosentyx (secukinumab) 64 confirmed on Day 29) and then discontinued study treatment as a result of the event. On Day 29 (21 Feb 2012), positive autoantibody test (unspecified) and he was diagnosed with pemphigus. Treatment included antibiotics and steroids. On Day , the patient was hospitalized for steroid pulse therapy. On Day he was discharged from hospital. The event pemphigus was ongoing at the time of reporting. The investigator suspected a relationship between the event pemphigus and the study medication.</p><p>Reviewer comment: Autoimmune diseases represent a heterogeneous family of chronic, disabling diseases with different natural histories and a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms. While many individual autoimmune diseases are rare, these disorders share underlying defects in the immune response which leads the body to target its own organs and tissues. Data on the overall incidence and prevalence of autoimmune disease is limited. This makes it difficult to predict the number of cases that one would expect in the study population. Other biologic therapies affecting molecular components of the immune system for the treatment of autoimmune disease have been associated with the paradoxical development of autoimmune processes. Anti-TNF agents carry warnings describing the various autoimmune diseases associated with use of the product.</p><p>Because the event rate of autoimmune adverse events is similar to that of Etanercept, this reviewer is concerned that the product may also be associated with paradoxical development of autoimmune disease. It is not clear to this reviewer how best to label the product to reflect this concern because the majority of the individual events only occur one time. Also, if secukinumab is found to be associated with inducing autoimmunity, it is not clear which patients would be at risk and thus steps to mitigate development of an autoimmune disease could be not be described in labeling.</p><p>The applicant is proposing a labeled warning for Crohn's disease, for which there is additional strength of evidence to support, see below. It is this reviewer's opinion that at this juncture, additional information should be collected on autoimmune AEs in longterm studies and post-marketing to better characterize the potential risk for associated autoimmune disease.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inflammatory Bowel Disease</head><p>The applicant performed a search using the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) narrow NMQ. This reviewer finds the search teams in the query to be acceptable. The search in Pool A yielded 3 cases of IBD in total, with an incidence across the treatment groups (0.1%, 0.1%, 0% and 0.3% for 300 mg, 150 mg, placebo and etanercept). Of these, the 2 cases on secukinumab were SAEs. Among 22 patients with a prior history of IBD (secukinumab 13 and placebo 9), Crohn's disease was reported in 1 patient on 150 mg compared with 0 patients on placebo. Among 1369 patients on secukinumab with no prior history of IBD, ulcerative colitis was reported in one patient on 300 mg.

Treatment included piperacillin with tazobactam. No action was taken with the study medication. On , the patient was discharged from the hospital, and the event of anal fistula was considered resolved. The patient completed the maintenance period of the study on Day 367, having received the last dose of the study medication on Day 362. The investigator did not suspect a relationship between the event anal fistula and the study medication.</p><p>Reviewer comment: Fistulas are often found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, particularly Crohn disease. The cumulative incidence of fistula formation in patients with Crohn's disease is 17-50%. Perianal activity often parallels abdominal disease activity, but it may occasionally be the primary site of active disease.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Because anal fistulas can also be associated with abscess, diverticulitis, foreign-body reactions, actinomycosis, chlamydia, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), syphilis, tuberculosis, radiation exposure, and HIV disease, there is not enough information to determine if this is the first presentation of Crohn's disease or if the fistula is due to some other etiology.</head><p>One additional case of Crohn's disease was identified in the psoriasis program, in patient AIN457A2308-6012005 on 300 mg in Study A2308 (Argus ID PHHO2013US005303), which occurred during the maintenance period and therefore Caucasian who experienced ulcerative colitis on Day 65 during the induction period. The event was graded as severe and was not reported as an SAE. The investigator suspected a relationship between the event and study drug and the study drug was permanently discontinued.</p><p>The safety update identified in ongoing psoriasis trials 1 additional new case of ulcerative colitis after 518 days of secukinumab 300 mg. Also, 2 SAE cases of inflammatory bowel disease were reported in the ankylosing spondylitis program. Neutropenia was primarily assessed based on central laboratory assessments which are discussed in section 7.4.2 Laboratory Findings. AE analysis using terms in both narrow and broad queries served as an additional assessment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer comment: The applicant is proposing labeling for Crohn's disease in the warnings and precautions section. This reviewer agrees with including labeling based on clinical trial data and the biologic plausibility (clinical trials assessing treatment of Crohn's disease with anti-IL-17 demonstrated lack of efficacy/ worsening of symptoms</head><p>The incidence of the preferred term neutropenia was higher in all active treatment groups compared to placebo in Pool A.</p><p>Neutropenia narrow NMQ for 300 mg, 150 mg, placebo, and etanercept, respectively  0.3%, 0.1%, 0.0%, and 0.6% Neutropenia broad NMQ for 300 mg, 150 mg, placebo, and etanercept, respectively  0.6%, 0.3%, 0.0%, and 0.6%</p><p>Reviewer comment: The applicant is proposing to include neutropenia in labeling as an adverse reaction that occurred at rates less than 1%. This reviewer concurs with the proposal. The incidence of neutropenia AEs was higher on secukinumab than placebo and increases were dose dependent. Also, the PT neutropenia was a most frequent (&gt;=0.10% in any group) AEs causing discontinuation. Neutropenia as assessed based on central laboratory assessments and was more frequently associated with secukinumab treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Most cases of neutropenia associated with secukinumab were transient and reversible and a few were associated with non-serious infections. Therefore, it is this reviewer's opinion that the labeling of neutropenia does not need to be elevated to the warnings and precautions section at this time.</p><p>There is biologic plausibility for the reductions in peripheral neutrophil counts. It may be due to a possible pharmacodynamic effect of systemic IL-17A blockade, based on the role of IL17A in innate immunity and neutrophil biology. Because neutropenic events were also reported with Phase 2 results of two other anti-IL17 therapies, brodalumab 3 and ixekizumab 4 , there appears to be a class effect. Assessment for neutropenia should continue to be conducted in LTE studies and AE reports in post-marketing should be followed. However, because few serious cases occurred, this reviewer is not recommending labeling the product for neutrophil monitoring at specific intervals during treatment. All 3 events in the secukinumab arm have the similar mechanism of ischemia; the event on placebo does not. Although the number of events is few, an imbalance in ischemic events, more frequent in secukinumab-treated subjects on the highest dose (300mg), was noted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE)</head><p>It is expected that few events would be identified in this short, 3 month assessment period. The longer assessment at 52 weeks identified additional MACE cases. However, direct comparisons cannot be made. There were differing sample sizes between the active and placebo arms as well as differing durations of therapy for many patients as time progressed over the 52 weeks of follow-up. Placebo patients experienced high efficacy failure rates and dropout rates, and could be placed on active therapy in extension trials. Thus, the numbers of placebo patients became quite small and analysis adjusting for exposure (per 100 patient years) over the 52-week treatment period was performed. After adjusting for exposure, secukinumab at both doses (IR=0.51 for any 300 mg and 0.44 for any 150 mg) was comparable to placebo and etanercept (IR=0.50 for placebo and 0.34 for etanercept).</p><p>MACE cases submitted with the original application and additional cases reported in the safety update are shown in the table below. </p></div>

Elevations in ALT (&gt;10×ULN), AST (&gt;5×ULN), TBL (&gt;2×ULN), and ALP (&lt;2×ULN) occurred in this patient at Week 44 during the maintenance period and were reported by the investigator as non-serious AEs related to study treatment. Sixteen days prior, this patient had taken two different non-prescription cold preparations both containing acetaminophen for 5 days. By the next visit (Week 48) ALT, AST, TBL and ALP levels were all decreased and the patient received the next scheduled dose of secukinumab after a 1-week delay. By Week 52 (end of maintenance period), all hepatic enzyme levels had returned to within normal limits.</p><p> One additional patient met Hy's Law laboratory criteria based on local laboratory results: patient [AIN457A2304-3065007] in the 300 mg group, who reported SAEs of cholecystitis and hepatitis. The hepatic enzyme elevations in this patient were temporally associated with concurrent cholecystitis and, therefore, did not represent drug-induced liver injury. Reviewer comment: The role of IL-17A blockade in direct liver toxicity is not known. Evaluation of AEs related to hepatic disorders in the clinical trials did not identify a safety signal for liver toxicity at this juncture.</p></div>

The imbalance in total AEs was mainly due to the most frequently occurring SOC of infections and infestations. Consistent with the results by SOC, the rates of nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection in the two secukinumab dose groups were higher than the placebo. Common AEs by preferred term in the induction period of Pool A trials are summarized by study in the table below. The incidences of the most common events were similar across all treatment arms (300 mg, 150mg, and placebo) and between studies. Pooled data of common AEs is shown in the table below.

Although rates are higher for the 300 mg group as compared with the 150 mg group, because the associated confidence intervals are overlapping, the rates are essentially comparable across all treatment groups.

Dr. Preston Dunnmon, cardiology concludes and this reviewer agrees that there is no evidence for important drug induced prolongation of the QT interval or PR interval in the categorical analyses of the induction periods for Pool A and Pool B, as shown in the tables below:  No special safety studies were conducted because no special safety concern arose from non-clinical safety data obtained with secukinumab.</p></div>

Of the 10 subjects who developed ADAs, 3 subjects were classified as positive for neutralizing antibodies, 5 subjects were classified as negative for neutralizing antibodies, and the remaining 2 subjects were not characterized for neutralizing antibodies status.</p><p>Non-treatment emergent ADAs were also observed in the same psoriasis trials in which 1.7% (56/3364) of secukinumab naive subjects had positive ADA at baseline (n=47) or at a post-baseline time point without secukinumab exposure (n=9) in placebo subjects. Among the 56 subjects tested positive for ADA at baseline, 49 subjects did not have any positive ADA samples following the treatment with secukinumab.</p><p>Subjects with secukinumab treatment-emergent ADA were not associated with a loss of therapeutic efficacy which is defined as increase in PASI score by 6 points from minimum PASI score achieved on treatment. The development of treatment-emergent ADA was not associated with injection site reactions or other severe administration reactions including hypersensitivity events. Overall, no evidence of altered PK, efficacy or safety has been observed in subjects who developed secukinumab treatmentemergent ADA in psoriasis Phase 3 trials. However, it is not feasible to draw a definitive conclusion on the impact of ADA, or lack thereof, on the clinical efficacy and/or safety measures because of the small number of subjects with treatment-emergent ADA.</p><p>The neutralizing ADA assay appears to be insensitive and the presence of secukinumab in the clinical serum sample in subjects with higher levels would interfere with the assay. Novartis provided additional data which indicates that the assay may be more sensitive.</p><p>Since the levels of ADA detected are relatively low, the Product Quality reviewer finds the assay acceptable. See Product Quality Review (immunogenicity section) by Tura Camilli, Ph.D., for more detailed information regarding the immunogenicity assay validation. The Clinical Pharmacology team also finds that is not essential at this time to develop an improved neutralizing ADA assay because the overall immunogenicity incidence is low for secukinumab in the psoriasis Phase 3 trials and there was no evidence of altered PK, efficacy or safety in the ADA positive subjects. See Clinical Pharmacology Review. This reviewer concurs with the Clinical Pharmacology team's assessment. The applicant evaluated 2 doses (150mg and 300 mg) in the phase 3 studies. Since two doses were selected for further Phase 3 evaluation, it allows for further assessment of dose-response for both safety and efficacy in a much larger patient population. Differences in efficacy between the doses were noted with an overall increase in response for the 300 mg dose group. See section 6.1.4 Analysis of Primary Endpoint(s).</p><p>Safety data comparing both doses was available for approximately 700 subjects each for the maximal duration of dose of 52 weeks (induction dosing followed by monthly dosing). Additional data is also available for comparison between doses, but it is of a shorter duration of 12 weeks. Pooled analysis of 52-week safety data in the two pivotal Phase 3 trials showed an overall AE rate of 80.3% and 81.9%, respectively, for the 150 mg and 300 mg doses. Analyses for the majority of specific adverse events evaluated did not demonstrate differences between the 300 mg and 150 mg secukinumab cohorts. Dose-dependent differences were noted for neutropenia and infections. For neutropenia, small increases in rates for reported AEs and decreases in neutrophil counts on laboratory analysis were noted to be dose-dependent. The overall rate of reported AEs for infections and infestations was also dose-dependent. Differences, with higher rates in the 300 mg group, were seen for some types of upper respiratory tract infections (pneumonia, bacterial pharyngitis, and sinusitis) and mucosal/ skin infections (impetigo, candidiasis). Also, herpes viral infections occurred in a higher proportion of patients in the 300 mg group than the 150 mg group and were higher than placebo (1.6%, 0.9%, 0.4% for 300 mg, 150 mg and placebo); no cases of disseminated or CNS herpes were reported. Infections requiring oral or parenteral antimicrobial concomitant treatment were more frequently reported in the 300 mg group than the 150 mg group (12.2% for 300 mg, 9.4% for 150 mg and 7.2% for placebo.</p><p>In analyzing infections which were dose-related, a difference for candida infections was noted. These infections were more frequently reported at the 300 mg cohort and are consistent with mechanism of action. Animal models predict susceptibility to candidiasis with deficiencies in the IL-17 pathway. Of the various known human deficiencies in the IL-17 pathway, the majority are associated with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC). Some may also be associated with staphylococcal skin infections and pulmonary infections 5 .</p><p>To more closely examine the relationship between infections and exposure, particularly candidiasis, an exploratory safety analysis by exposure quartiles was performed. The analysis showed a trend of increasing AEs with increasing exposure only at 300 mg   The overall number of total events (n=9 for 150 mg and n=19 for 300 mg treatment groups) is small, the Phase 3 data showed a trend of association between exposure and candida infection.</p><p>The Agency conducted its own analyses with pooled data. Concentrations of secukinumab were divided into four quartiles in exposure response analysis. The concentrations at week 52 were utilized for the analysis. Adverse events that showed dose response relationship from the applicants report and AEs that are possibly related to the mechanism of drug action were evaluated and are show in the figure below. The profiles show that candida infections, herpes viral infections, staphylococcal skin infections, and all infections that required treatment increased as concentration of secukinumab increased. Again, due to small numbers, these represent a trend and are not statistically significant.</p><p>At the same dose the secukinumab serum concentrations were higher in subjects with a lower body weight than those in subjects with a higher body weight in the Phase 3 trials. Thus, weight is likely to have an impact exposure-response to safety.</p><p>The applicant provided an analysis of AEs for most frequently reported SOC by weight strata; this is presented in 7.5.3 Drug-Demographic Interactions. The table below comparing AEs for the SOC infection and infestations is an excerpt from this analysis.  For infections, the rate in the 300mg dose group was greater than in the 150 mg dose group for both weight strata. Within the 300mg group dose, subjects weighing &lt;90 kg demonstrated higher rates of infections than subjects weighing &gt;90 kg.</p><p>The Agency analyzed incidence rates by dose and weight group for AEs that showed dose response relationship from the applicants report and AEs that are possibly related to the mechanism of drug action were evaluated. The following set of table shows the results. Infection rates were higher with the 300 mg dose, and it was higher in lighter patients (&lt;90 kg) for the same dose. As predicted by exposure, lighter patients who received 300 mg dose had higher rates of infection due to the higher concentrations. Exposure response analysis for safety demonstrates that adverse event rates for certain types of infections tend to increase as the concentration of secukinumab increases. The effect of body weight was also observed.</p><p>Reviewer comment: The applicant proposes a 300 mg dose for all patients regardless of weight, or other patient variables. Overall, with the exception of small differences between the doses for treatable infections and CTCAE grade 1/ 2 neutropenia, the safety analysis to date indicates no major dose-dependent safety issues. My review of the application suggests that both the 300 mg dose and the 150 mg dose of secukinumab are both reasonably safe for some duration of plaque psoriasis treatment. It is uncertain if these small differences in neutrophil count and infections will translate into more serious adverse reactions when secukinumab is used for a longer duration of treatment in a broader patient population. Also, it is not clear to this reviewer if the increased incidence in candida infections (which may severe as a "marker" for level of IL-17 inhibition) in patients with higher exposure suggests an increased risk for immunosuppression. If so, in is uncertain if the effects will only be limited to CMC. Additional long-term safety information is needed to make these determinations based on experience with other precedent biologic products.</p></div>

To this reviewer the usefulness of comparison to placebo is not clear since the risk of infections with Etanercept has been well characterized. This reviewer finds this data useful in comparing the safety profile of both doses of secukinumab by weight because these arms had similar numbers of subjects treated for similar length of duration permitting a more direct comparison. The table below shows the most frequent adverse events by weight strata.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 5</ref> <ref type="bibr">-5</ref> The incidence rate of AEs was comparable between the doses in the lower weight subjects and slightly lower than in the higher weight subjects where 150 mg rate was greater than the 300 mg rate.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.5.4">Drug-Disease Interactions</head><p>There is a potential for psoriasis disease-drug-drug interaction (disease-DDI) based on the current understanding that psoriasis patients have elevated proinflammatory cytokines which can suppress the expression of some CYP enzymes and the CYP enzyme expression could be normalized upon disease improvement following biological treatment. The clinical pharmacology team is recommending that the Applicant conducts a clinical trial to determine the potential of secukinumab to alter the metabolism of CYP substrates in psoriasis patients (e.g., using a cocktail of relevant CYP probe drugs). This reviewer concurs with the request for a post-marketing commitment to assess disease-DDI. Labeling is also recommended to describe possible drug-drug interactions impacted by changes in CYP enzymes. See section 7.5.5 Drug-Drug Interactions below. An approval of secukinumab in adult patients would trigger PREA as a new active ingredient. The requirements needed to address PREA were discussed with the applicant at a guidance meeting on March 2, 2011. The Agency found the general approach of waiver/ deferral of pediatric subjects to be reasonable. Because the development plan for secukinumab predates the requirements under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), the applicant was not required to submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (iPSP) within 60 days of an EOP2 meeting. However, Novartis submitted an iPSP for secukinumab on February 11, 2013. This plan was reviewed and discussed at PeRC on February 27, 2013. PeRC and DDDP determined that it was premature to agree with the proposed deferred studies as outlined and the plan should be replaced with a broader plan which would address the informational needs for safety and efficacy in pediatric patients. Written comments regarding the iPSP were sent to the applicant on April 5, 2013. The applicant decided not to follow the process for pediatric plans under FSASIA and submit a plan to address PREA with the BLA submission.</p><p>The applicant is requesting a waiver for pediatric patients under 6 years of age based on studies not being feasible to conduct as there are too few children under the age of 6 with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. This reviewer concurs with the waiver based on the estimates described in the available, albeit limited, literature. Studies show that the prevalence of psoriasis in pediatric patients is low and that the rate increases in the older age cohorts. The limitations of the studies are that the type and severity of psoriasis captured in the data is not defined. Therefore, the subset of pediatric patients under the age of 6 with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis available to study would likely be limited. Also in support of the waiver the sponsor cites the unknown impact of secukinumab on the developing innate immune system in this age group and concomitant live vaccinations which are often administrated in this age group.</p><p>For pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age, the applicant is requesting a deferral until after 12 months of treatment data in adults from phase 3 trials is available and PK modeling is assessed to guide dosing. They have proposed the submission of the final study report as December 31, 2018 and have submitted a protocol for a 288 pediatric subject study. This reviewer does not concur with the applicant's proposed timeline for the pediatric studies. At this juncture the safety for this monoclonal antibody which affects the immune system is not sufficiently characterized to permit evaluation of risk or rare adverse events or for adverse events with long latency periods (e.g. malignancies). It is the recommendation of this reviewer to delay the initiation of pediatric studies until the adult long-term safety is better characterized.</p><p>Granting a waiver in the 0-6 year 11 month pediatric cohort and deferral for a period of several years post-approval in the 6-17 year cohort is consistent with the approach the Division has taken for biologics approved for the treatment of psoriasis. To date no biologic treatment has been approved in the U.S. for use in patients with plaque psoriasis less than 18 years of age. However, some TNF inhibitor products, which have been approved for use in pediatric autoimmune diseases, are used off-label to treat pediatric patients with psoriasis.</p><p>The pediatric plan was discussed at the Pediatric Review committee on July 16, 2014. The committee agreed with the Division to grant a partial waiver in patients ages birth to less than 6 years because studies are impossible or highly impractical and to the deferral because additional safety or effectiveness data is needed. There was some disagreement about the length of time to complete the studies. Some PeRC members noted that the safety concern should be addressed with proper controlled studies in children rather than waiting on adult long-term safety data if the current data do not identify a specific pediatric safety concern. Some PeRC members agreed that a long deferral to complete pediatric studies would be acceptable to collect long-term adult safety information but that labeling should reflect that the product is not recommended to be used in pediatric patients if this approach is used. Novartis did not identify reports of secukinumab overdose in clinical studies. Overdose (preferred term) was reported as an SAE in 3 subjects (2 on secukinumab and 1 on placebo). However, the extra doses taken were placebo injections and thus were not overdoses of active drug. Single doses of secukinumab up to 30 mg/kg (i.e. approximately 2000 -3000 mg) have been administered intravenously in clinical studies in other autoimmune indications, and doses up to 3 x 10 mg/kg i.v. have been administered in psoriasis studies. Acute toxicity was not seen with these treatments.</p><p>As expected, the safety profile of secukinumab did not suggest rewarding effects or abuse related behaviors related to treatment.</p><p>Complete withdrawal was not fully assessed as many subjects continue on treatment for long term safety assessment. In study 2304 comparing a fixed interval (FI) and a startof-relapse (SoR) maintenance dosing regimen, no clear withdrawal or rebound effects were seen. The AE profile was comparable between subjects in both arms. The incidence of worsening forms of psoriasis, such as erythrodermic psoriasis and pustular psoriasis, was low overall and comparable between the FI and SoR dosing regimens (described in Section 7.3.5).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Secukinumab is a first-in-class, fully human, monoclonal IgG1κ anti-IL17A antagonist antibody for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. The sponsor states the following:</p><p>IL-17A is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in inflammatory and immune responses. IL-17A also plays a key role in the pathogenesis of plaque psoriasis. IL-17A is upregulated in lesional skin in contrast to non-lesional skin of plaque psoriasis patients. Secukinumab works by binding to IL-17A and in this way inhibiting its interaction with the IL-17 receptor. As a result, secukinumab indirectly inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and mediators of tissue damage, and reduces IL-17A-mediated contributions to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Treatment with secukinumab reduces erythema, induration, and desquamation present in plaque psoriasis lesions, as well as itch and pain caused by these skin symptoms.</p><p>The psoriasis phase III program was initiated in 2011, and is comprised of five pivotal phase III studies <ref type="bibr">(2302,</ref><ref type="bibr">2303,</ref><ref type="bibr">2304,</ref><ref type="bibr">2308,</ref><ref type="bibr">2309)</ref>, and one supportive study (2307), and assesses three forms of secukinumab (lyophilisate in vial, liquid in pre-filled syringe, and liquid in pen/autoinjector). There were four phase II trials in patients with psoriasis. The sponsor notes a total of more than 3,400 psoriasis patients have been treated with secukinumab in controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies, and a total of approximately 4,500 patients have been treated with secukinumab in controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies in various indications (plaque psoriasis and other immune mediated conditions). From these datasets, the sponsor concludes that the safety of secukinumab is similar to or improved over current standard biologic treatments.</p><p>Subjects with stable cardiovascular risk factors were not excluded from the phase II and phase III clinical trials that have been submitted to support this BLA. The applicant has provided 2 types of analyses of cardiovascular events described in the summary of clinical safety (section 2.1.5.2):</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) identified using Novartis</head><p>MedDRA Query (NMQ) search terms (see Appendix 1 of this review) and adjudicated by a cardiovascular and cerebrovascular safety adjudication committee 2) Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular (CCV) events using an expanded SMQbased search definition set.</p><p>The review Division noted a small imbalance in ischemic events (more frequent in secukinumab-treated subjects). However, the overall number of MACE and CCV events was low. The applicant compares incidences (12 wk) of secukinumab vs. placebo vs. entanercept and incidences (52+ wk) in dose-adjusted exposure (per 100 patient years) of secukinumab vs. placebo vs. entanercept. Additional cases of MACE have been recently included in the 120 day safety update (2/20/14).</p><p>The review Division requests DCRPs opinion with respect to the following:</p><p>• Is the Applicant's search and analyses adequate for assessing the cardiovascular safety for this product? • Is dose-adjusted exposure analysis preferred for the 52+ wk comparison vs.</p><p>incidence of events? • Please provide your assessment of cardiovascular safety and advise on whether you would recommend labeling or additional data/analysis to better assess/describe cardiovascular safety.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rationale for CV Safety Concerns</head><p>The sponsor's rationale for being concerned about a potential for CV harm, and the methodology to be used to collect data to address this concern was stated as follows:</p><p>Whether and how anti-inflammatory therapies modulate CV risks has become a focus of attention for regulators as well as for the scientific community. A recent publication of rare but numerically greater incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients receiving anti IL-12/23 antibodies for the treatment of plaque psoriasis compared to patients on placebo (Ryan 2011) provides a rationale for monitoring and evaluating the potential risk of MACE in the secukinumab clinical development program.</p><p>IL-17 is an IL-23 induced cytokine in atherosclerotic plaque inflammation 1 . Metaanalyses of MACE events from RCTs using anti-TNF-alpha agents (e.g. etanercept) and from RCTs using anti-IL-12/23 agents (e.g. briakinumab) were performed (Ryan, 2011). Though no significant drug effect of MACE was demonstrated in these meta-analyses, the authors were concerned about the numerically higher number of MACE events that occurred with the anti-IL-12/23 agents. The results of those two meta-analyses are shown in the following two figures from the Ryan publication:</p><p>BLA 125504</p><p>Definitions for MI, stroke, and CV death that were used by the CCV-AC are listed in Appendix 2 of this Review. The CCV-AC adjudication form is shown in Appendix 3 of this review. <ref type="figure">Findings (from sponsor's nonclinical overview and tox summary)</ref> The sponsor states that therapeutic monoclonal antibodies that are cytokine modulators have been identified for harboring DDI potential. It has been reported that cytokine levels are associated with the expression, stability, and activity of certain cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes in several in vitro and limited in vivo studies. Due to the limited number of co-medications in secukinumab-treated psoriasis patients and the down regulation of IL-6 after secukinumab treatment, it is concluded that for the general psoriasis patient population, the clinical impact of secukinumab-induced DDI is minimal; therefore dedicated DDI studies were not considered necessary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nonclinical Safety</head><p>The sponsor also notes that the cardiovascular, CNS and respiratory safety of secukinumab was assessed in a specific telemetry safety pharmacology study in cynomolgus monkeys. No biologically relevant effects on the cardiovascular, CNS or respiratory functions attributable to secukinumab were observed. No unexpected binding to cardiac or cardiovascular, CNS or respiratory tissues was identified in any of the cross reactivity studies using cynomolgus monkey and human tissues. In addition, In vitro blood compatibility and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity analyses did not show any adverse reactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Trials --Integrated Safety Data Structure</head><p>All psoriasis trials were conducted in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Six phase III psoriasis trials were completed and summarized in the An additional phase II study (2212) was conducted but excluded from the analysis due to data quality concerns. Specifically, center 0001 enrolled 65/ 80 patients in the trial, but was found to have GCP violations that resulted in the site being closed. Deficiencies included failure to protect blinding, failure to administer study drug infusions as per protocol, and failure to maintain adequate records resulting in underreporting of AEs. The safety results of study 2204 were therefore considered separately and not included in the data pools.</p><p>Safety data up to 52 weeks are provided by 2 placebo-controlled trials (Study A2302 and Study A2303, the latter incorporating an active comparator control), and 1 maintenance regimen comparison trial (Study A2304). Further longer term data (&gt;1 year) are provided by an ongoing, uncontrolled, extension study (Study A2211E1). The main features of these trials are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> The final structure of the integration is shown in the table below (from the SCS):</p><p>BLA <ref type="formula">125504   11</ref> The evaluation of CV safety will focus on pools A and B, though the uncontrolled occurrence of CCV outcomes will be noted for Pool C. All treatment groups in Pool A had similar durations of exposure to study treatment in the induction period. The median duration of exposure was 84 days and ≥ 96% of patients were exposed for at least 8 weeks. However, total exposure to the entanercept active control arm was just under half the exposure in the AIN457 arms due to fewer patients being exposed in that arm, as seen in the table below (from the SCS). For those patients who came earlier than Day 85 for the Week 12 visit, they were not included in the "≥12 weeks" row for the induction period.</p><p>Pool B (all psoriasis trials, induction period and entire treatment period) and Pool C All treatment groups in Pool B had similar durations of exposure to study treatment in the induction period. The median duration of exposure was 84 days and ≥95% of patients were exposed for at least 8 weeks. However, total exposure was substantially less in the placebo and entanercept arms due to substantially fewer patients in these arms, as shown in the table below:</p><p>BLA 125504 14</p><p>The exposure differential for placebo became much more pronounced for the entire treatment analysis period due to the high number of patients failing placebo treatment and rolling over to active drug, as can be seen in exposure table for Pool B (entire treatment period) below:</p><p>BLA <ref type="formula">125504   15</ref> The exposure differential between AIN457 (any dose) and placebo for the entire treatment period of Pool C (all trials, all indications), was even more imbalanced, as seen in the table below:</p><p>Of note, Pool B constitutes the largest pool of safety data in psoriasis, with 3430 patients treated with at least one dose of secukinumab, with 2725 patient-years of exposure comprising 76% of the total exposure. Therefore, the psoriasis studies in Pool B constitute the majority of the unblinded safety data for the program, with smaller exposure contributions from completed studies in other indications contributing to Pool C.</p><p>Reviewer's note: Given these time-driven exposure imbalances, which are understandable given the nature of the disease the lack of effectiveness of placebo, I agree with the sponsor's use of exposure-corrected adverse event rates for the extended follow-up analyses of Pool B and Pool C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient Dispositions</head><p>For Pool A (pivotal placebo-controlled psoriasis trials), greater than 95% of patients treated with AIN457 during induction completed the induction period. There were no deaths and similar percentages of patients discontinued drug due to adverse events across the treatment arms, as seen in the table below (from the SCS). Withdrawals for lack of efficacy were numerically lower for the AIN457 treatment arms than for Placebo or for the Etanercept active comparator, as seen in the disposition summary table below:</p><p>The disposition data for the induction period of Pool B (all psoriasis trials) were similar.</p><p>For the maintenance period of Pool B (all psoriasis trials), a numerically higher percentage of patients on AIN457 remained on therapy as compared to placebo and Etanercept (88% vs 81% vs 87%, respectively), with adverse event-driven withdrawal being similar for the AIN457 and placebo groups, as seen in the table below (from the SCS). There was one death in an AIN457 treatment group in Pool B, which will be discussed below in the MACE analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographics and Baseline CV Risk</head><p>The sponsor notes that exclusion criteria were less restrictive in the AIN457 phase II/III trials than may have been the case with other biologics being developed for the treatment of psoriasis. Germaine to this consult, there were no exclusions of patients with active, ongoing cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, unless the conditions were severe, progressive, or uncontrolled, such as uncontrolled hypertension or significant congestive heart failure (NYHA class III or class IV). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Common Adverse Events</head><p>Common AEs according to primary SOC in the induction period of the pivotal placebocontrolled psoriasis studies (Pool A) are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_53">Table 2</ref>-1 below (from SCS). Findings relevant to CCV safety include:</p><p>• Blood and lymphatic system disorders (SOC) were similar between secukinumab and etanercept (1.9%, 2.5% and 2.5% for 300 mg, 150 mg and etanercept, respectively), though rates in all active treatment groups were greater than placebo (1.0%). The imbalance vs. placebo was primarily due to lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, leukopenia, lymphocytosis and neutropenia, although the rates of these events in the 300 mg secukinumab dose group were generally low (0.1-0.7%) and similar to etanercept (0-0.9%).</p><p>• Renal disorders were reported with a comparable rate for 300 mg and 150 mg secukinumab and etanercept (1.0%, 1.2% and 1.5%, respectively), which were higher than placebo (0.3%). As all events in any active treatment groups were single occurrences, there was no predominant term driving the imbalance vs. placebo.</p><p>• A higher rate of vascular disorders was observed with 150 mg secukinumab (4.0%) than with 300 mg (1.3%), which was lower than placebo and etanercept (2.3% and 2.2%, respectively). This difference was primarily due to a higher rate of hypertension in the 150 mg group (3.2%) compared to the 300 mg, placebo and etanercept groups (1.0%, 1.7% and 1.5%, respectively). Both secukinumab dose groups also reported a higher rate of hypertension at baseline (25.8% for 300 mg and 28.3% for 150 mg vs. 22.3% for placebo and 20.7% for etanercept).</p><p>• PTs in the cardiac disorders SOC were reported more frequently for placebo and etanercept (1.7% and 2.2%, respectively) than for either secukinumab dose (0.6% for 300 mg and 1.2% for 150 mg), despite higher rates of prior cardiovascular disease or risk factors for such reported at baseline. AEs contributing to this difference vs. were related to conduction disorders, such as left bundle branch block. 24 03-Jul-2010 and then azathioprine for hepatitis on 28-Aug-2010. On 30-Aug-2010, the patient started treatment with infliximab for psoriasis but the infliximab was discontinued that same day.

The patient was diagnosed with disseminated aspergillosis infection on 12-Jul-2011 and died from this infection on , days after the last dose of the study medication. It should be noted that this patient had discontinued secukinumab one year prior to the diagnosis of aspergillosis, a complication following liver transplantation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CCV Events</head><p>Given the association between psoriasis and increased rates of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular mortality, the evaluation of cardiovascular risk in patients with psoriasis was expanded by the sponsor to include events beyond myocardial infarction and stroke. Events identified by this expanded search were called CCV events. The NMQ definition set for this search included PTs from the following MedDRA SMQs:</p><p>• Myocardial infarction (broad SMQ) • Central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhages and cerebrovascular conditions (broad SMQ) • Cardiac failure (narrow SMQ) • Peripheral revascularization procedures (standard NMQ) • Cardiac arrhythmia terms, non-specific (narrow SMQ) • Ischemic cerebrovascular conditions (broad SMQ) • Conduction defects (narrow SMQ) • Other ischemic heart disease (narrow SMQ) • Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (narrow SMQ) • Tachyarrhythmia terms, nonspecific (narrow SMQ) • Ventricular tachyarrhythmias (narrow SMQ).</p><p>No new MACE events were identified using these expanded search terms for electronic queries of safety and clinical databases. The incidence of CCV AEs and SAEs for the induction period of Pool B is shown below, with a lower overall incidence of CCV events BLA 125504 37 in the AIN457 arms as compared to placebo and etanercept, and similar trends as were seen for the original MACE analysis for this cohort:</p><p>Exposure adjusted analysis of Pool B for the entire treatment period demonstrated similar trends in the incidence rates of these events, as shown in the table below: BLA 125504 39</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TQT -not done ECG Data Analysis</head><p>In clinical studies of secukinumab, standard 12-lead ECGs were performed at selected visits. The following ECG variables were summarized: ventricular rate, RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, and corrected QT interval (QTc) using Bazett (QTcB) and Fridericia (QTcF) corrections. There is no evidence for important druginduced prolongation of the QT interval or PR interval in the categorical analyses of the induction periods for Pool A and Pool B, as shown in the tables below: Assessments 1. Is the Applicant's search and analyses adequate for assessing the cardiovascular safety for this product?</p><p>There are two elements to this question that need to be addressed separately. First is whether the trials were capable of generating adequate CCV safety data from which to draw conclusions. Second is whether the analytical assessment on the data that was generated was appropriate.</p><p>As far as the as ability of the datasets to address CCV safety, there are some limitations. To start with, the induction period of Pool A (placebo-controlled psoriasis trials) has about 700 patients in the 150 mg, 300mg, and placebo arms in trials of 12 weeks duration. The active treatment arms of the induction period for Pool B (all controlled psoriasis trials, 12 weeks duration) are a little larger, starting with 1174, 1173, and 793 patients in the 150 mg, 300 mg, and placebo arms respectively. While these sample sizes may have been inadequate to show statistically significant differences in MACE events between the groups, this was at least in part the result of the fact that MACE events occurred so infrequently in this fairly young population of psoriasis patients. Furthermore, it should be noted that the patient exposure years for the entire treatment period of pool B were 1142, 1178, and 201 for the 150mg, 300mg, and placebo-treated patients, respectively. Thus, the active drug exposure in this sponsor's psoriasis development program far exceeded the 771 patient exposure years for the anti-IL12/23 agents in the Ryan-2011 metaanalysis.</p><p>Another potential limitation was the high and asymmetrical number of dropouts. The entire treatment period for Pool B is the best data that is available to assess CV safety in the psoriasis population with respect to sample size and duration of exposure, but the dropout rate from the 52 week analysis was exceptional, with only about half the patients remaining in the active treatment arms at week 52, and fully 96.7% of the placebo patients having dropped out or switched to other therapies. These premature drops were not followed for safety outcomes until the end of the studies.</p><p>The analytical approach likewise had some limitations. None of these studies had a prespecified safety or efficacy endpoint measuring CV outcomes -this entire analysis is based on retrospective electronic NMQ/SMQ scanning of the datasets for specific sets of Preferred Term adverse event occurrences and death. Thus, incomplete ascertainment of CCV events may have occurred. However, it is unlikely that an important loss of MI, stroke, and death events occurred while patients were participating in the trials -the potential for lack of ascertainment of these types of events would have been reasonably expected to have been confined to the dropouts.</p><p>These things being said, we do think that the sponsor has done a very good job (as probably a good of job as can be done) defining patient pools to maximize exposure. Furthermore, the data was assessed with two different definition sets for CV adverse outcomes which produced similar results across three differently defined assessment periods. The inclusion of the etanercept control, albeit small (323 subjects), served as a benchmark for the safety of therapy with a biologic in this condition, though once again, the limited sample size, exposure times, and very small number of CCV events limit the conclusions that can be made regarding comparative cardiac safety between AIN457 and etanercept.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Is dose-adjusted exposure analysis preferred for the 52+ wk comparison vs. incidence of events?</head><p>Yes. There were differing sample sizes between the active and placebo arms as well as differing durations of therapy for many patients as time progressed over the 52 weeks of follow-up. Placebo patients experienced high efficacy failure rates and dropout rates, and could be placed on active therapy in extension trials. Thus, the numbers of placebo patients became quite small. In this circumstance, the exposureadjusted analyses of event rates are preferred.</p><p>3. Please provide your assessment of cardiovascular safety and advise on whether you would recommend labeling or additional data/ analysis to better assess/describe cardiovascular safety.</p><p>In the context of the 2011 Ryan meta-analysis (which did not show a statistically significant harmful effect), the clustering of CCV SAEs in the active AIN457 treatment arms of the entire treatment period of Pool B was carefully examined, and that table is reproduced below for convenience:</p><p>It can be seen that non-MACE CCV events in the entire treatment period of Pool B occurred infrequently (1 or 2 occurrences at most) in the 150 and 300 mg active treatment arms, with some of these events occurring in the placebo and/or Etanercept arms as well. While the expression of the rates of these events in terms of patient years of exposure helps put their incidence into context with the placebo comparator, it does not correct for the near complete dropout of placebo patients during extended follow-up, which limits the number of patients available in the placebo arms to have events. Thus, there is not a convincing signal here for a CV safety concern, and we think that the CV safety of this product can be adequately described in labeling. X 27.

This reviewer focused primarily on 2 data pools provided by the applicant, pool A and pool B. Pool A consisted of the 4 randomized, placebo-controlled studies 2302, 2303, 2308, and 2309. Pool A provides short-term safety data with comparable numbers of subjects for secukinumab 150 mg, 300mg and placebo through week 12. This data pool included 1382 subjects who received any dose of secukinumab. Of those approximately half received 150mg (692 subjects) and half received 300 mg (690 subjects) and a similar number of subjects received placebo. Another analysis provided pooled safety data from all 10 psoriasis trials (Pool B) which included a broader range of doses and/or dosing regimens. Various loading and maintenance doses, routes of administration, alternative dosing intervals and duration of treatment are included in this pooled analysis. Pool B provides safety data through week 52 with dosing ranges of 3 to 30 mg/kg (i.v.); 25 to 300 mg (s.c.). 3430 subjects received any dose of secukinumab. Of those, 2751 subjects were treated for at least 6 months and 1641 subjects treated for at least 1 year. Due to differing sample sizes</note></figure>

Subject AIN457A2211E1-0039-00001, who died from disseminated aspergillosis status-post liver transplant, developed autoimmune hepatitis on secukinumab treatment requiring the transplant. This AE report was reviewed (see review by A. Woitach in DARRTS 6/6/12) and this reviewer concluded that the individual case does not provide definitive causality for any of the reported events.It is this reviewer's opinion that the cases reporting death do not appear to represent a treatment related safety signal at this juncture. Based on the deaths which occurred in trials, cardiovascular risks and autoimmune diseases should be monitored by postmarketing surveillance.In the 12-week pooled analysis of Trials 2302, 2303, 2308 and 2309 (Pool A), the incidence of SAEs was low and comparable for both doses of secukinumab and placebo (2.0% for both 300 mg and 150 mg vs. 1.7% for placebo).

For patients entering the extension study at Week 52, the Week 52 assessments performed before start of extension treatment were included. o There is no maintenance period for Studies A2212 and A2220. o Patients in Study A2307 rolled over from Study 2304 (where they received induction treatment for 12 weeks) and therefore the maintenance period in A2307 is defined as randomization to the Week 40 visit. Day 1 until the last visit of the treatment period. For Studies A2302, A2303 and A2304, it includes the Week 52 visit, unless the patient entered the extension study (as defined above for the maintenance period). For all other studies, the end of the entire treatment period is defined as the visit scheduled 4 weeks after the last dose of study treatment. If no visits were scheduled 4 weeks after last dose, all safety assessments and reported events up to 4 weeks (28 days) after last dose were included. The overall duration of the entire treatment period was at least 12 weeks. o For patients in Study A2307, the entire treatment period included 12-week data from Study A2304 and 40-week data from Study A2307. o For patients originally randomized to placebo and then re-randomized to secukinumab (Studies A2302, A2303, A2211), there were two entire treatment periods: on placebo before switching and on secukinumab after switching. o The follow-up period for Studies A2302, A2303, A2304 and A2307 are not included in the CSRs and the SCS provided in this submission. Data for the follow-up period, Weeks 52 to 60, will be described in separate study reports.MACE events were analyzed by meta-analysis for the data pools of the pivotal placebocontrolled psoriasis studies (Pool A). The absolute rate difference for all studies assuming a fixed-effect model was estimated by means of the Mantel-Haenszel method ofGreenland and Robins (Greenland and Robins 1985). As it turned out, there were so few MACE events that only the absolute number and incidence of these events was displayed (see table 2-25 on page 35 of this consult).</figDesc><table><row><cell>Analysis Periods Exposure</cell></row><row><cell>• Induction period: Day 1 until Week 12 visit for all assessments Pool A (pivotal placebo-controlled trials, induction period)</cell></row><row><cell>• Maintenance period:</cell></row><row><cell>o • Entire treatment period:</cell></row><row><cell>Reviewers comment: None of the four pivotal trials included in Pool A incorporated a MACE or CCV outcome event as a primary or secondary endpoint.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_102"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>For Pool A (pivotal placebo-controlled psoriasis trials), the subject mean age was approximately 45 years, and 70% were male. Mean BMIs across study arms were approximately 29 kg/m 2 . With respect to smoking history in Pool A overall, 35.0% were current smokers, 19.9% were former smokers, and 45.1% had never smoked. The three most commonly reported cardiovascular risk factors were hypertension, dyslipidemia/hyperlipidemia and uncomplicated diabetes. Most of the reported prior cardiovascular conditions were ongoing at the time of enrollment. Small percentage imbalances in cardiovascular risk factors were seen for both secukinumab dose groups compared with placebo and, to a lesser extent, etanercept, but given the different sample sizes this translated into larger imbalances in the absolute number of patients at risk in the secukinumab dose groups. These included hypertension (25.8% for 300 mg and 28.3% for 150 mg vs. 22.3% for placebo and 20.7% for etanercept), dyslipidemia/hyperlipidemia (18.4% and 17.6% vs. 14.3% and 13.0%), uncomplicated BLA 125504 19 diabetes (9.1% and 9.1% vs. 7.5% and 8.4%) and stable coronary artery disease (2.5% and 2.5% vs. 1.4% and 0.9%). In addition, the 300 mg group showed higher rates of prior myocardial infarction (2.6% for 300 mg vs. 1.0%, 1.7% and 1.8%, respectively, for 150 mg, placebo and etanercept) and atrial fibrillation (1.6% for 300 mg vs. 0.7%, 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively, for 150 mg, placebo and etanercept). As would be expected, similar trends were seen in the Pool B demographics since Pool A is a subset of Pool B.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

There was no history of liver or biliary disorders, and the patient's lipase values were within normal limits prior to the event. On an unspecified date in 2012, the patient's gammaglutamyltransferase (GGT) values were &gt;100-200 U/L (normal range: &lt;55). The patient received the most recent dose of study medication on 03-Jul-2013 in the extension study A2304E1. Laboratory tests on 04-Jul-2013 showed elevated but stable liver enzyme values. A few days prior to 20-Jul-2013, the patient began experiencing recurrent upper abdominal pain. On , the patient was hospitalized and diagnosed with acute exudative pancreatitis. The hospital course was complicated with worsening lung function requiring intensive care and ventilation. Abnormal cytology suggested myelodysplastic disease or myeloproliferative neuroplasia. Hospital course was also complicated with staphylococcal sepsis diagnosed on . The patient was treated with ciprofloxacin. On , the patient completely recovered from the staphylococcal sepsis, upper abdominal pain and delirium. On , the patient completely recovered from the pancreatitis and was discharged from hospital. The investigator suspected a relationship between the staphylococcal sepsis and study medication. The other events (pancreatitis, deterioration of lung function, upper abdominal pain and delirium) were suspected to be related to the progression of concomitant disease (alcohol abuse).</p><p>Reviewer comment: Oropharyngeal candidiasis, or thrush, is a common local infection seen in infants, older adults who wear dentures, patients treated with antibiotics, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy to the head and neck, and those with cellular immune deficiency states, such as AIDS. Candida esophagitis is more commonly seen in immunocompromised patients. It tends to occur later in the natural history of HIV infection and almost invariably at lower CD4 + T-cell counts. Because of the mechanism of secukinumab and the known relationship of IL-17 blockade and mucocutaneous candidiasis, it is not clear if this case of esophageal candidiasis, treated with amphotericin B lozenges, is suggestive of a degree of immunosuppression that could potentially lead to serious complications. However, no cases of disseminated candidiasis have been reported in the clinical trials. The product will be labeled for risk of Candida infections.</p><p>Both cases of sepsis occurred on 300 mg of secukinumab. It is possible that the cases may be related to immunosuppression due to secukinumab treatment. Other factors could have contributed to the increase risk for severe infection. In one case, a risk factor included the concomitant disease diabetes and in the other case, a prolonged Reference ID: 3669014 o The applicant reports a total of 7 cases retrieved from a search of the autoimmune disorders NMQ in plaque psoriasis studies. 5 cases describe psoriasis o 1 psoriasis subjects on 150 mg dose reported autoimmune hemolytic anemia o 1 psoriasis subjects on 300 mg dose reported idiopathic thrombocytopenia Patient A2304E1-5037-5037009 was a 72-year-old, 109kg, male with a history chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease/chronic renal insufficiency with stage 3 proteinuria, hypertension, GERD, splenomegaly, elevated liver function tests, hepatic steatosis, coronary artery disease and chronic anemia.

On 19-Aug-2013, the patient complained of fatigue, malaise and dyspnea on exertion and was scheduled for an outpatient blood transfusion on . He was found to have warm antibodies and diagnosed with autoimmune hemolytic anemia by a hematologist. Laboratory tests showed elevated creatinine, elevated total bilirubin, decreased iron, decreased hemoglobin (6 g/dL), and elevated LDH and ferritin. The patient received steroid treatment (prednisone) along with paracetamol, budesonide, formoterol fumarate, diphenhydramine, furosemide, ondansetron, and folate sodium. The patient was discontinued from study medication. On , the patient completely recovered from the event and was discharged from hospital.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FORMULATION:</head><p>Secukinumab is supplied as 150 mg secukinumab in 1 mL of sterile solution in a single-use prefilled syringe (also referred to as PFS), a single-use prefilled pen (also referred to as AI, pen, or SensoReady pen) for self/home administration; and as 150 mg secukinumab as a powder for solution (requiring reconstitution for injection) in a single-use glass vial (also referred to as 'Lyo in vial') for use by health care professionals only.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DOSE:</head><p>The recommended dose is 300 mg by subcutaneous injection with initial dosing at weeks 0, 1, 2, and 3 followed by monthly maintenance dosing starting at week 4. Each 300 mg dose is given as 2 subcutaneous injections of 150 mg. Four potential cases of MACE in plaque psoriasis studies were identified and referred for adjudication by the CCV-AC. There were three acute myocardial infarctions and one stroke. All were confirmed by the event committee. Three are known to be on AIN457, and for the other case, treatment is blinded. A summary of those events and the final adjudication determinations are shown in the following table:</p><p>Reviewer's comment -this is somewhat difficult to interpret due to the fact that there are very few placebo patients left. The sponsor states that, "…no new SAEs were reported for placebo, as there were few ongoing placebo patients during the 120-Day SU reporting interval (7 placebo patients in Study A2223 as of <ref type="bibr">31-Jul-2013)</ref>. The only other studies with placebo patients were A2302 and A2303; however, both studies completed the last patient last visit prior to the 120-Day SU reporting interval <ref type="bibr">(30-Apr-2013</ref><ref type="bibr">for A2302 and 08-Jun-2013</ref> for A2303) and no new SAE reports from these 2 studies were expected for this SU. Treatment codes remained blinded after Week 12 for patients initially randomized to placebo in Studies A2308 and A2309."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional DCRP Comments</head><p>• The sponsor states that the follow-up period for Studies A2302, A2303, A2304 and A2307 are not included in the CSRs and the SCS provided in this submission, and that data for the follow-up period, Weeks 52 to 60, will be described in separate study reports. When will those follow-up reports be submitted for review?</p><p>• This sponsor's vital sign analysis is limited with respect to assessing extreme shifts of blood pressure in the smaller number of potentially vulnerable patients. We note that the common AE analysis shows an excess of AEs in the vascular disorder SOC which was primarily due to a higher rate of hypertension in the 150 mg arm of Pool A. Furthermore, all four SAEs of hypertensive crisis that occurred in the entire treatment period of Pool B clustered in the AIN 457 treatment arms. Just to confirm the lack of any extreme BP effect in a small number of patients, shift tables between normal, stage I, and Stage II BPs, and K-M curves showing time to first BP above those cutoffs would be helpful.</p><p>• It is unclear what occurred with the two episodes of pulmonary edema that were reported within 30 days of starting study drug (see details of clinical courses, pages 27-28 of this review). Both of these subjects became very ill (one profoundly hypoxic, the other developed ascites). Both resolved when study drug was discontinued. There is no known mechanism by which a human antibody could cause such an effect. It is noted that one of these patients had preserved LV systolic function by echo and was treated with antibiotics (raising the possibility that this was pneumonia). The other patient had atrial fibrillation at baseline and developed ascites (suggesting pre-existing cardiac disease). It is unlikely that these cases represented drug-induced congestive heart failure (though we would be glad to review any other information that may be available regarding these two subjects).</p><p>Of note, the sponsor reports that the two SAEs in the cardiac disorders SOC of Pool A on 150 mg AIN457 were these two cases. Furthermore, in the expanded SMQ search for CCV events, only two cases of cardiac failure or congestive cardiac failure were identified, and these were the same two patients as described above.</p><p>Appendix 1 Preferred terms used in MACE NMQs (from sponsor's CCV-AC Charter Appendix 1) <ref type="figure">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</ref>--This is a representation of an electronic record that was signed electronically and this page is the manifestation of the electronic signature. <ref type="figure">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</ref>  <ref type="figure">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</ref> </p></div>
