<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Risk Benefit Assessment</head><p>Overall, the risk-benefit assessment is favorable for Lu AA21004 for the treatment of MDD in adult patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Recommendations for Post-market Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies</head><p>We did not identify major risks that would merit a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). However, a Medication Guide is required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Recommendations for Post-market Requirements and Commitments</head><p>• MDD studies in children (7 to 12 years old) and adolescents (13 to 17 years old) are required as post-market requirements.</p><p>• A long-term relapse prevention study in US:</p><p>In US, only Lu AA21004 20 mg demonstrated efficacy while Lu AA21004 5 -15 mg did not separate from placebo in the MDD short-term studies. However, outside US, the MDD short-term studies demonstrated efficacy of Lu AA21004 5 -20 mg and the long-term relapse prevention study demonstrated efficacy of Lu AA21004 5 -10 mg. As a post-market commitment, we request a long-term relapse prevention study in US, which should provide helpful information regarding the dose of maintenance treatment and dose response in US.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Important Safety Issues with Consideration to Related Drugs</head><p>Vortioxetine has an activity of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with additional serotonin receptor activities (antagonist at 5-HT3, 5-HT7, and 5-HT1D; partial agonist at 5-HT1B; agonist at 5-HT1A). SSRIs, as a class, have been associated with the following safety concerns: These issues are specifically addressed in Section 7, Review of Safety. <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 2</ref> summarizes the highlights of regulatory interactions between the sponsor and FDA: </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">•</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Submission Quality and Integrity</head><p>This reviewer audited adverse event (AE) safety data for accuracy in few samples (subjects with serious AEs: 0343/331, 0037/503, SK001/S1133, 0026/906) of submitted Case Report Forms (CRFs) and did not audit a certain proportion of them due to time constraints. The AEs from the CRFs for these subjects were compared to those in the narrative summary in the study body report. No deficiencies or discrepancies were noted.</p><p>However, some quality issues were identified during the normal course of reviewing the submission: the initial submission did not include some data we needed for review. The sponsor was able to submit the responses upon our requests at a timely fashion. For example, the sponsor did not include the follow-ups of the abnormal liver function test (LFT) results leading to discontinuations. Upon request, the sponsor submitted the narratives and follow-up lab results, which were acceptable. Another example is Subject 0350-303 in Study 303 had a low platelet count. Upon request, the sponsor provided the narrative and complete blood count (CBC) of this subject which indicated the subject had pancytopenia, but no corresponding AE was reported and no CBC was repeated, which was unsatisfactory. Furthermore, this reviewer identified some discrepancies between the integrated summary of safety (ISS) and the individual study reports. Upon request, the sponsor clarified the discrepancies. Refer to Section 9.4 for all the requests we made during the course of review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Office of Scientific Investigations Inspections Study Site Selection</head><p>Susan Leibenhaut, M.D. at Office of Scientific Investigations (OSI) recommended using the site selection tool to select 5 sites in 4 studies to be inspected by OSI. Therefore, we selected 5 sites in Study 305, 315, 316, and 11985A based on the analysis results of the site selection tool. <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 3</ref> shows the rationale of site selection, which was based on mostly the total risk ranking, the total number of enrollment and ranking in individual study and other safety and efficacy information. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inspection Results</head><p>The OSI inspection consisted of auditing: (1) compliance with GCP regulations, (2) adequacy of financial disclosure, informed consent procedures, and IRB oversight, and (3) adherence to SOPs for the oversight of clinical study sites and contract research organizations, handling of protocol deviations, AE reporting, data management, and drug accountability.</p><p>OSI did not find any evidence of un-blinding or biased data collection. The reported protocol deviations were felt accurately reported in the NDA listings. Drug accountability records were felt adequate. The study data reported in the NDA were felt reliable. OSI concluded that the sponsor adhered to the applicable statutory requirements and FDA regulations governing the conduct of clinical investigations and the protection of human subjects.</p></div>

The review team held many status meetings during the course of this NME review and the main concern was the finding of polypoid adenomas of the rectum in high dose females in the Rat Carcinogenicity Study. Our Pharmacology/Toxicology team met with executive Carcinogenicity Assessment Committee (CAC) and the Committee concurred that the polypoid adenomas of the rectum in high dose females were drug-related. CAC suggested including this finding in the product label.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Completed Studies</head><p>• 10 MDD short-term placebo-controlled studies • 1 MDD long-term placebo-controlled relapse-prevention study • 4 GAD short-term placebo-controlled studies • 1 GAD long-term placebo-controlled relapse-prevention study  <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 4</ref> lists the completed studies and the on-going studies in more detail (next page).       </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Review Strategy</head><p>The efficacy assessment will focus on 6 positive MDD short-term studies (11492A, 305, 13267A, 315, 316, 12541A) and one positive MDD long-term relapse-prevention study. Among the other 4 MDD short-term controlled clinical studies, 11984A was a failed study (neither Lu AA21004 treatment groups nor duloxetine 60mg separated from placebo) and 3 others (Study 303, 304 and 317) were negative studies.</p><p>The MDD open label studies are not reviewed for the efficacy purpose due to the openlabel design and lack of placebo control so that the efficacy cannot be readily established. However, the MDD open label studies together with studies in Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and phase 1 studies are used in the analysis of safety.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Efficacy Summary</head><p>This section summarizes the efficacy of the 10 MDD short-term studies and the longterm relapse prevention study that the sponsor submitted to support the efficacy of Lu AA21004 5 mg -20 mg taken by mouth (p.o.) QD in the treatment of MDD.</p><p>The cumulative evidence from the MDD short-term studies and the long-term relapse prevention study demonstrated the efficacy of Lu AA21004 5 mg -20 mg in the treatment of MDD in non-US subjects. However, in US short-term studies, only Lu AA21004 20 mg demonstrated efficacy. The reason of the regional treatment difference between US and non-US is unclear.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Summary of MDD Short-Term Studies</head><p>This reviewer compiled <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 11</ref> which lists the study number (Study No.), the region the study was conducted, main inclusion criteria, results of Lu AA21004 doses (only the proposed doses 5 mg -20 mg are included), and the overall study results of the 10 short-term studies. Six out of 10 studies were positive.     Subjects with MDE on Lu AA21004 (5 or 10 mg) experienced a statistically significantly longer time to relapse than those in placebo (p &lt; 0.005).</p><p>Study 11985A demonstrated the efficacy of Lu AA21004 5 mg and 10 mg p.o. QD in the prevention of relapse of MDE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Rationale for Selection of Studies for Review</head><p>The clinical review for efficacy focused primarily on 6 positive short-term controlled MDD studies and the positive MDD long-term efficacy relapse prevention study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.1">Method/Study Design/Analysis Plan of MDD Short-Term Studies</head><p>Overall Study Design All of the 10 short-term MDD studies were randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, fixed-dose studies with the treatment duration of 6 or 8 weeks. Six studies had active controls (5 studies used duloxetine and 1 study used venlafaxine).</p><p>Eligible subjects were randomized equally to each treatment group including placebo, and fixed doses of Lu AA21004 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg QD; (the doses varied across studies). Study 11492A had an active control of venlafaxine 225 mg/day and 5 other studies had an active control of Duloxetine 60 mg/day.</p><p>In Studies 315, 316, and 317, subject randomization was stratified by baseline sexual dysfunction (SD) status (normal or abnormal SD).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dose and Administration</head><p>The study drug was taken by mouth (p.o.) once daily (QD).</p><p>The subjects who were randomized to Lu AA21004 1, 2.5, 5, or 10 mg started treatment on that dose, whereas the subjects who were randomized to Lu AA21004 15 or 20 mg were titrated up from 10 mg after 1 st week. The subjects who were randomized to duloxetine in Studies 11984A, 304, and 12541A started and stayed on 60 mg during the treatment period, whereas in Studies 13267A and 315 they were titrated up from 30 mg to 60 mg after the 1 st week.</p><p>The active control venlafaxine in Study 11492A was titrated stepwise twice during the 1 st week from 75 mg to 150 mg and then to the treatment dose of 225 mg QD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selection of Study Population</head><p>The study population included male and female subjects aged ≥18 years with a primary diagnosis of MDD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition; Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key Inclusion Criteria:</head><p>The following table listed the key differences in the eligibility criteria for the 10 shortterm MDD studies. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key exclusion criteria:</head><p>• had any current psychiatric disorder other than MDD (the MINI or the SCID-I was used to assist in the exclusion of disallowed Axis I disorders); a history of manic or hypomanic episode; schizophrenia; any other psychotic disorder; a mental disorder due to a general medical condition; any clinically significant neurological or neurodegenerative disorder; or any significant Axis II disorder.</p><p>• had a significant risk of suicide (as judged by the investigator; a score ≥5 on MADRS item 10 [suicidal thoughts] at the Screening and Baseline Visits; or a suicide attempt during the last 6 months)</p><p>• had clinically significant unstable illness</p><p>• had any substance-related disorder (except nicotine or caffeine) within the previous 6 months (within at least 2 years in Study 13267A); had a diagnosis of alcohol or substance abuse that was not in sustained full remission for at least 2 years prior to screening (Studies 315, 316, and 317)</p><p>• had treatment-resistant depression (defined as resistant to 2 adequate antidepressant treatments of ≥6 weeks' duration, as judged by the investigator)</p><p>• receiving formal cognitive, behavioral, or other systematic psychotherapy</p><p>• had received electroconvulsive therapy (or vagal nerve stimulation, or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation [Studies 13267A, 315, 316, and 317]) within 6 months prior to the Screening Visit 12541A was a study in the elderly aged ≥65 years with at least 1 MDE before the age of 60. Subjects with a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score &lt;24 were excluded in order to exclude the confounding effects of dementia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Primary and Secondary Efficacy Endpoints</head><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to endpoint of either MADRS or HAM-D24 total score. CGI-S and CGI-I were measured in all 10 short-term studies as secondary efficacy endpoints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Methods</head><p>The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all subjects who took at least 1 dose of study drug and who had at least 1 valid post-baseline measurement of the primary efficacy variable. The primary efficacy measurement -MADRS or HAM-D24 total score was analyzed by either a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis using observed cases (OC), or an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) using the last observation carried forward (LOCF). <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 15</ref> lists the primary efficacy analyses in 10 MDD short-term studies. For more details, please refer to the more comprehensive statistical review by Dr. George Kordzakhia. In each study, a hierarchically ordered testing strategy was defined in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) and comprised the primary efficacy endpoint and key secondary efficacy endpoints. The testing strategy comprised either 1 sequence, or 2 sequences tested in parallel. Formal testing stopped as soon as the hypothesis in the hierarchy could not be rejected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.2">The Results of Individual MDD Short-Term Studies</head><p>We examined the results of 6 positive studies carefully and presented the study results individually in this section.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographics</head><p>Approximately 55% of the subjects in the venlafaxine group and 65% of the subjects in the placebo and Lu AA21004 groups were women. The mean age of the subjects was 43 years, ranging from 18 to 65 years, and the majority (92%) was Caucasian</p><p>The age, race, weight and BMI were roughly comparable among treatment groups.</p><p>The mean age (SD) at Baseline was 43 (12) years. 92% were Caucasian, 6.8% were Asian, and 0.5% were Black. The mean weight (SD) for male was 82 (16) kg and the BMI 26 (4.5). The mean weight (SD) for female was 69 (15) kg and the BMI 25 (5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baseline Disease Characteristics</head><p>The baseline disease characteristics which were measured by MADRS total score and CGI-S rating at Baseline were comparable among all the treatment groups <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 16</ref>).  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 17</ref>).</p><p>The number of subjects who withdrew prematurely due to lack of efficacy in Lu AA21004 5mg group (5.6%) was almost as high as the placebo (5.7%). Venlafaxine group had the lowest rate of early termination due to lack of efficacy (1.8%). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concomitant Medication Use</head><p>This reviewer focused primarily on prohibited (disallowed) concomitant medication use that may have impacted study results -specifically the use of prohibited concomitant antidepressants, antipsychotic, and benzodiazepines and such.</p><p>This reviewer examined <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 34</ref> in the clinical study report of Study 11492A (page 212-232) which listed concomitant medications either discontinued prior or at Baseline or continued at Baseline or started at or after Baseline. The following table summarizes the findings. All the disallowed concomitant antidepressants, antipsychotics and benzodiazepine listed below were started at or after Baseline. In the response dated May 17, 2013, the sponsor submitted a line listing of all subjects who took disallowed concomitant antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepine derivatives, or benzodiazepine related drugs during the double-blind treatment period in Study 11492A. All subjects who were included in PPS took Zolpidem/Diazepam/Zopiclone for insomnia for a short period of duration (1-2 days), which would less likely have affected the overall efficacy results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol Deviations</head><p>The sponsor mentioned in the submission that after un-blinding the study, an audit was conducted at center AT002 and found that the quality of the medical records at this center was inadequate. They repeated the efficacy analyses without the data from center AT002 and they found that the results from these analyses were slightly more favorable for Lu AA21004. Therefore, they kept the 28 subjects randomized in this center in all the analyses.</p><p>This reviewer examined the inclusion/exclusion/withdrawal criteria deviations (Panel 11: clinical study report page 55-56) and procedural compliance deviations (Panel 12: page 57-58). The sponsor did not note here that the subject who took olanzapine in Lu AA21004 10mg group was excluded from the Per-protocol set (PPS), but they mentioned in the response dated May 17, 2013 that this subject was actually not included in PPS. Other deviations were minor and the handling of the deviations appeared to be appropriate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Findings Primary Efficacy Endpoint</head><p>The primary efficacy endpoint, change from Baseline and the difference of change to placebo by week in MADRS total score are shown in the following table. In each treatment group, bigger changes were observed with longer treatment. Mean changes from Baseline MADRS total score are shown by study visit for all treatment groups in the following figure. Lu AA21004 10mg started to separate from placebo from Week 2 and 5mg from Week 3 onwards.  The following table shows the mean change from baseline to endpoint and the effect size. The sponsor was able to demonstrate statistical significance using FAS, LOCF for both Lu AA21004 5mg and 10 mg (p&lt;0.0001) compared to the placebo at the endpoint. The sponsor did not pre-specify any key secondary endpoints for this study. The mean age (SD) at Baseline was 46 (12) years. About 34%-39% of the subjects were male. 86% were Caucasian, 11% were Asian, and 2% were Black. The mean weight (SD) was 75 (16) kg and the BMI 26 (4.9). The baseline characteristics of smoking and alcohol consumption were comparable among treatment groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.2.2">-Study 305 (Non-US)</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baseline Disease Characteristics</head><p>The baseline disease characteristics which were demonstrated in Baseline MADRS total score and CGI-S rating were comparable among all the treatment groups. They were summarized in the following table. Subject Disposition A total of 560 subjects were randomized to this 8-week treatment trial. The completion rate at Endpoint was 90.7%, 90.7%, 92.1% and 87.1% for placebo, LU AA21004 1 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg groups, respectively.</p><p>As expected, the placebo group (5.7%) had the highest premature withdrawal due to lack of efficacy and Lu AA21004 10mg group (3.6%) had the highest premature withdrawal due to AEs. Since the protocols allowed occasional use of zopiclone, zolpidem or zaleplon for severe insomnia, many subjects had concomitant use of these medications. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol Deviations</head><p>The percentage of subjects with at least 1 major protocol deviation was similar across all treatment groups: 5.7%, 4.3%, 5.7% and 4.3% in the Lu AA21004 1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg and placebo, respectively. As mentioned earlier, the subject who took Zyprexa was not included in the PPS and therefore it would not have affected efficacy results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Findings Primary and Secondary Efficacy Endpoint</head><p>The primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline to endpoint in HAM-D24 total score. It was analyzed by an LOCF ANCOVA. SDS and CGI-I were the secondary efficacy endpoint.   Since Δ SDS total score at Lu AA21004 10mg was not significant (p= 0.135), the multiplicity controlled hierarchical testing stopped (see the following table for the predefined hierarchical testing strategies for Study 305). Therefore, none of the subsequent endpoints including Lu AA21004 5 mg were considered significant, according to the predefined hierarchical testing strategies for Study 305 shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 26</ref>. Hierarchical testing in 1 sequence; α = 0.05 -at Week 8: 1. Δ HAM-D24 total score -10 mg 2. Δ SDS total score -10 mg 3. CGI-I score -10 mg 4.

The proportion of subjects who relapsed was lower in the LuAA21004 group (13%) than in the placebo group (26%). Placebo-treated subjects had two times the risk of relapse. Since the sponsor did not follow FDA advice regarding extending the stabilization period, the statistical analysis team Dr. Peiling Yang and Dr. George Kordzakhia and we requested the sponsor to explore the actual stabilization durations for each subject and the relapse results. The following is the response from the sponsor, which shows the weeks of stabilization of subjects in Lu AA21004 and placebo group. The sponsor also provided the relapse rates and the hazard ratio in the remission duration subgroups shown in the following table. In all subgroups of stabilization duration, the Lu AA21004 treated subjects had significantly less risk of relapse of MDE. </p></div>

No dose relationship was observed across the Lu AA21004 dose groups. Four (4) SAEs were experienced by at least 2 subjects in Lu AA21004 treatment groups: depression (4 subjects), suicide attempt (3 subjects), suicidal ideation (3 subjects) and convulsion (2 subjects). Two cases of convulsion were related to traumatic brain injury.</p><p>• In the MDD relapse prevention Study 11985A, the incidence of SAEs of Lu AA21004 Total during the Open-Label Period was 2.2%. The incidence of SAEs of Lu AA21004 Total was slightly higher than placebo in the Double-Blind phase (3.4% and 2.1%, respectively).</p><p>• In the GAD relapse prevention Study 12473A, the incidence of SAEs of Lu AA21004 Total during the Open-Label Period was 1.5%.

The incidences of SAEs of Lu AA21004 5mg, 10mg, 15mg and 20mg groups were not dose-related (1.5%, 1.3%, 0.4% and 0.4%, respectively).   This reviewer examined the SAEs in the MDD short-term pool and did not find any concerning safety signals.</p><p>Four (4) SAEs were experienced by ≥2 subjects in Lu AA21004 treatment groups: depression (4 subjects), suicide attempt (3 subjects), suicidal ideation (3 subjects) and convulsion (2 subjects). The SAEs of depression, suicidal attempt and suicidal ideation were most likely due to the underlying disease -MDD. In terms of the 2 cases of convulsion, one had past medical history of traumatic brain injury and seizure disorder; the other case of convulsion was caused by head trauma.</p><p>Other SAEs were experienced only by 1 subject. The cases described below appeared to be concerning, but after reviewing the case reports; we believe most were not related to the study drug.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>The use of psychotropic medications including SSRIs has been reported to cause sexual dysfunction (SD) during treatment of MDD. The sponsor used the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX) and collected data from voluntarily self-reported TEAEs related to SD to evaluate SD as TEAE related to Lu AA21004 treatment.</p><p>The sponsor used ASEX in 7 of the short-term clinical studies in MDD (Study 11984A, 13267A, 315, 316, 317, and 304) and 1 study in GAD (Study 308) to identify treatmentemergent sexual dysfunction (TESD). The ASEX scale is a 5-item rating scale that quantifies sex drive, arousal, vaginal lubrication/penile erection, ability to reach orgasm, and satisfaction from orgasm. Possible total scores range from 5 to 30, with the higher scores indicating more sexual dysfunction. The ASEX was assessed at Baseline and at each study visit in these studies. In addition, the sponsor collected data on voluntarily self-reported TEAEs related to SD in all MDD and GAD studies.</p><p>Our review focused on the assessment by ASEX rather than the voluntarily self-report of TESD because TESD is known to be under-reported by subjects and therefore is less reliable.</p></div>

The sponsor defined a shift as for each individual item on the ASEX if the item changed from ≤3 to &gt;3 or from 4 to 5 or 6 or from 5 to 6 during the treatment period. They defined SD worsening as if the subject had ≥ 3 different items on the ASEX shift at the same evaluation visit.</p><p>The following table shows the incidence of worsening SD in subjects with SD at baseline at MDD/GAD Short-Term Pool. The overall incidence of worsening SD was dose-related for Lu AA21004 treated groups. For the male subjects, the incidence of SD by preferred term as TEAEs was 3.1%, 4.1%, 3.5% and 4.9% in Lu AA21004 5, 10, 15 and 20mg treated while it was 1.7% in placebo and 12.1% in Duloxetine 60mg treated male subjects.   For the female subjects, the incidence of SD by preferred term as TEAEs was 0.9%, 1.3%, 0.6% and 1.6% in Lu AA21004 5, 10, 15 and 20mg treated while it was 0.8% in placebo and 1.2% in Duloxetine treated subjects <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 102</ref>).  The findings of TESD in the MDD/GAD Short-Term Pool were similar to those of the MDD Short-Term Pool. The events of SD were non-serious. There were a total of 4 discontinuations in Lu AA21004 treated groups (2 in 5 mg, 1 in each of 15 and 20 mg). There was 1 discontinuation in Duloxetine group and none in placebo (refer to submission <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 2</ref>.sss in ISS, page 222/410).</p><p>For the male subjects, the incidence of SD by preferred term as TEAEs was 3.6%, 4.3%, 3.5% and 4.9% in Lu AA21004 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg treated while it was 1.6% in placebo and 14.2% in Duloxetine 60 mg treated subjects (refer to <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 2</ref>.sss in ISS, page 222/410).</p><p>For the female subjects, the incidence of SD by preferred term as TEAEs was 1.3%, 1.6%, 0.6% and 1.6% in Lu AA21004 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg treated while it was 0.7% in placebo and 1.9% in Duloxetine treated subjects (refer to <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 2</ref>.sss in ISS, page 222/410).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>• A statistically significant difference in the mean number of discontinuationemergent symptoms was observed for subjects discontinuing Lu AA21004 15 mg and 20 mg compared with placebo in the 1 st week of discontinuation according to the assessment of the pooled data from US Studies 315, 316, and non-US Study 13267A by DESS scale.</p><p>• The following DESS items had incidence of ≥ 5% and twice of placebo for subjects discontinuing Lu AA21004 15 mg and 20 mg at the end of the 1 st week: headache, muscle tension/stiffness, mood swings, and sudden outburst of anger, dizziness/lightheadedness/vertigo and nose runny.</p><p>• The results of self-reported AEs of discontinuation symptoms were not consistent with the findings of DESS assessment. First, the incidences of self-reported AEs were lower than those assessed by DESS scale. Second, there were no differences in self-reported AEs of discontinuation symptoms across the treatment groups in all studies.</p><p>• Since DESS scale is a direct form of inquiry administrated by clinicians which systematically evaluates discontinuation symptoms while self-reported AEs were based on subjects' spontaneous reports, we believe the data of discontinuation symptoms assessed by DESS scale were more reliable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendation</head><p>We recommend a dose decrease to 10 mg for 1 week before the complete discontinuation of Lu AA21004 15 and 20 mg. At the Type C meeting dated March 30, 2010, the Division advised the sponsor to formally assess the discontinuation symptoms using a reliable tool, rather than relying on spontaneous reports from subjects. The sponsor added DESS scale to MDD Short-Term Studies 13267A, 315, and 316. We recommended a randomized withdrawal design to assess discontinuation symptoms because such a design would permit a distinction between symptoms related to drug discontinuation and symptoms occurring as part of the background in these subjects (refer to FDA Advice dated 09/14/2010). However, the sponsor did not take the advice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discontinuation Symptom Assessment by DESS instrument</head><p>The DESS is a clinician-rated checklist designed to evaluate possible discontinuation emergent events seen when subjects discontinue the antidepressant treatment.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table  103)</ref>. The following figure presents a summary of the DESS total score at Weeks 8, 9, and 10. In Week 9, a statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.05) in the mean number of discontinuation-emergent symptoms was observed for subjects discontinuing Lu AA21004 15 mg (LS mean DESS total score 1.53) and Lu AA21004 20 mg (LS mean DESS total score 1.53) compared with placebo (LS mean DESS total score 1.06). No statistically significant changes were observed in subjects discontinuing Lu AA21004 10 mg (LS mean DESS total score 1.27) or tapering down on duloxetine from 60 mg to 30 mg (LS mean DESS total score 1.40).</p></div>

In additional to the DESS items listed above, the following DESS items occurred at ≥1% and at a rate twice of placebo at Week 9 or Week 10 in MDD Studies 315, 316, and 13267A: increased dreaming or nightmares, feeling unreal or detached, stomach cramps, nausea, restless feeling in legs, sudden panic or anxiety attacks, blurred vision, chills, unsteady gait/incoordination, shaking/trembling, increased saliva in mouth, shortness of breath/gasping for air, burning/numbness/tingling sensations, ringing/noises in the ears, elevated mood/feeling high, stomach bloating, fever, vomiting, unusual sensitivity to sound, unusual tastes or smells (refer to 2013-03-27-Req-for-Info-DESS.pdf).</p><p>Discontinuation Symptoms by Self-Reported AEs Discontinuation symptoms were also assessed by collection of self-reported AEs in MDD short-term Studies 315, 316, and 13267A, 11492A, 303, and 308, and in the relapse-prevention studies, 11985A and 12473A.</p><p>The self-reported discontinuation AEs collected from Studies 315, 316, and 13267A were pooled during the first and second week of the Discontinuation Period. The discontinuation AEs from MDD short-term Studies 11492A, 303, 11985A, 308, and 12473A and the MDD/GAD relapse-prevention studies were not pooled and presented individually by the sponsor.</p><p>The overall incidences of self-reported AEs during the first and the second week of the Discontinuation Period in the Lu AA21004 treatment groups for MDD Studies 315, 316, and 13267A were low and similar to placebo.  The overall incidences of self-reported AEs related to discontinuations did not show differences in Lu AA21004 treated groups and placebo in the MDD short-term Studies 11492A, 303, 11985A, 308, and 12473A and the MDD/GAD relapse-prevention studies according to the individual reports.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subject FI002-S1231 in Study 13267A</head><p>This was a 62-year old Caucasian male subject with a body mass index of 23.9 kg/m2 and an ongoing relevant medical history of low thrombocyte counts (November 2009) continued having low platelet count throughout the study. The investigator did not report this lab abnormality as an AE. The subject did not take any concomitant medications and received Lu AA21004 10-20 mg/day during study participation. The subject completed the trial as planned. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer's comment:</head><p>It appeared that this case of low platelet was not related to Lu AA21004 treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subject 0350-303 in Study 303</head><p>This 29-year old Caucasian male subject with a body mass index of 23.2 kg/m2 and no contributing medical or concomitant medications was withdrawn from the study on Day 21 due to lack of efficacy. The subject received Lu AA21004 5 mg/day during study participation. Laboratory results performed at the early termination visit on Day 21 were indicative of pancytopenia. No corresponding AE was reported because a hematologist and the investigator felt the original abnormal sample was most likely a lab error (possibly from the sample being in ambient status for too long a period of time resulting in instability of sample); the subject was completely healthy with no signs or symptoms that could be attributed to anemia or low leukocytes level. Therefore, instability of the sample was considered a possible explanation for the low hematology results. Previous study related hematology results for this subject, from samples collected at Screening and Baseline were within normal range. No repeat lab values were available for this subject. The subject did not report any adverse events at a safety follow-up visit on Day 42. </p></div>

Four (4) subjects in the MDD Short-Term Pool had elevated ALT and AST (≥5×ULN) without jaundice (normal bilirubin level) during Lu AA21004 treatment with normal baseline LFTs. Both ALT and AST returned to normal without changing or discontinuing the study drug. One subject in the GAD Short-Term Pool had elevated ALT and AST (≥5×ULN), which probably were related to alcohol drinking.

On Study Day 27, the subject experienced AEs of elevated CK of 12,401 and elevated liver enzymes; his ALT was 82, AST was 245, and ALP was 213. On Study Day 29, his CK was 3,261, CK-MB was 5.3 (reference range, &lt;4.8 ng/mL), ALT was 62, AST was 111, and ALP was 174. For 6 days before the AE onset, the subject reportedly did a workout with heavy lifting. AE symptoms included muscle soreness/aches since Study Day 26, attributed by the investigator to the recent workout. The subject denied having muscle weakness, generalized weakness, change in urine color, or other symptoms. He had hepatitis in 2000, but no other relevant medical history. He received no treatment for the AEs. The AE of elevated liver enzymes was considered resolved on Study Day 34 when the subject's ALT, AST, and ALP levels were 34, 38, and 170, respectively. The AE of elevated CK was considered resolved on Study Day 40 when he had a CK of 127. The subject was discontinued from the study due to the AE of elevated CK on Study Day 40; he took his last dose of study drug on Study Day 37. 317 7043/729 M/43/Black</p></div>

On Study Day 28, the subject experienced an AE of transaminases increased, assessed by the investigator as not related to study drug; her ALT, AST, and total bilirubin were 63, 70, and 1.3, respectively. The increased ALT, AST, and total bilirubin persisted and then peaked on Study Day 275 at 199, 207, and 1.7, respectively. The investigator reported on an unspecified date the subject had started consuming 1 to 1.5 liters of wine per day and alcohol abuse was provided as an alternative etiology for the AE. The subject reported her alcohol abuse was related to major stress as she was the victim of sexual abuse by her boyfriend and had withdrawn from school. The subject was later withdrawn from the study at Lundbeck's recommendation due to possible relapse of depressive symptoms (MADRS total score=22) and alcohol abuse. 301 0228/107 F/53/Asian OL Lu AA21004 5 At Baseline (Study Day 1), the subject's ALT was 11 (reference range: 0-47 U/L), AST was 20 (reference range, 0-37 U/L), and total bilirubin was 0.2 (reference range, 0-19 μmol/L). On Study Day 144, the subject experienced AEs of AST elevation and ALT elevation; her ALT was 295, AST was 1487, and total bilirubin was 0.5. The subject denied taking alcohol or any concomitant medications at the time of the AEs. The subject had a history of alcohol abuse from 1998 to 2008. Her last reported drinking episode was 03 March 2009, determined impulsive and not abusive by the investigator. On Study Day 150, laboratory testing performed by a non-protocol designated laboratory revealed that the subject's AST was 63 (reference range, 5-40 U/L) and ALT was 61 (reference range, 0-40 U/L); the AEs were considered resolved that same day. The subject was asymptomatic and continued in the study; her study drug dose was not changed. At Baseline (Study Day -1), the subject's ALT was 12 (reference range, 0-47 U/L), AST was 17 (reference range, 0-37 U/L), and total bilirubin was 0.8 (reference range, 0-1.1 mg/dL). On Study Days 144 and 145, the subject took an accidental overdose of Nyquil, a concomitant medication, which was considered an AE. On Study Day 149, she experienced an AE of elevated liver enzymes, when her ALT was 279, AST was 264, and total bilirubin was 0.3; the investigator assessed the AE as not related to study drug and provided an alternative causality of Nyquil overdose. The subject was discontinued from the study due to the elevated liver enzymes. Her Early Termination Visit took place on Study Day 161, when her ALT was 55, AST was 27, and total bilirubin was 0.6; the AE of elevated liver enzymes was considered resolved on that same day. 314 4133/401 M/31/Caucasian</p></div>

In addition, there was no evidence in animal studies of abuse potential (for example, self-mutilation or hyperactivity, as per our Pharmacology/Toxicology reviewer Dr. Antonia Dow). Therefore, Lu AA21004 was systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse.

The following table lists the SAEs. There are 2 SAEs are bleeding related: subdural hematoma and metrorrhagia. Subdural hematoma was probably caused by head trauma while metrorrhagia is hard to determine. It is less likely that the subject developed metrorrhagia after exposure of only 1 dose of IMP (do not even know whether the IMP was Lu AA21004). </p></div>

In many cases, hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). One case with serum sodium lower than 110mmol/L was reported in a subject treated with BRINTELLIX in a pre-marketing clinical study. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with a serotonergic antidepressant. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted can be at greater risk. Discontinuation of BRINTELLIX in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which can lead to falls. More severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death."</p></div>

The initial dose of Lu AA21004 was 5 mg, p.o., QD. The dose can be increased to 10 mg from Week 2 to Week 8 during the Open-label Period if clinically indicated and can be decreased back to 5 mg if subject could not tolerate the AEs. From Week 8, the dose was fixed. Subjects in remission (MADRS &lt; 10) at both visits at Weeks 10 and 12 in the Open-label Period were randomized 1:1 to either Lu AA21004 or placebo in the Double-Blind Period. The primary efficacy variable was the time to relapse of major depressive episode (MDE) within the first 24 weeks of the Double-blind Period.</note></figure>

The autopsy report stated the cause of death was morphine toxicity and manner of death was accidental. Autopsy external exam revealed needle sticks with surrounding ecchymosis on the antecubital fossae, and abrasions/needle sticks and scars on the forearms. Blood samples were positive for codeine and morphine.(MDD Short-Term Pool). His MADRS score was 30 at Baseline and was 15 at Final Visit. At the Baseline Visit for the open-label extension (Study 11984B), the subject received open-label study medication. Later that day, he was found dead having reportedly fallen from the fourth floor balcony. According to the investigator, the subject was not at risk of suicide and there were no signs of a suicidal act. On the day of the event, the subject's MADRS total score was 15 and his suicidal thought scored 0. The subject had no prior history of suicide attempts. No other AEs indicating that the subject was suffering from dizziness or blackouts were reported from Study 11984A. At the autopsy, there was no evidence of ethyl alcohol at judicial-toxicological examination of his body, blood, and urine. Study medication was returned to the site unopened. The investigator considered the event not related to study drug although suicide could not be ruled out as a cause according to the sponsor.</note></figure>

An event was considered discontinuation emergent if it was reported for the first time (new symptom) or if a previously reported event worsened (old symptom but worse). In either case, the event scores 1 point on the checklist.Data from the DESS scale was prospectively collected at Week 8 (end of the study), Week 9 (1 st week of the Discontinuation Period), and Week 10 (2 nd week of the Discontinuation Period) in Studies 315, 316, and 13267A. Comparisons between the different doses of Lu AA21004 and duloxetine to placebo for the DESS score changes at Week 9 and Week 10 were performed using an ANCOVA model. For Studies 315, 316, and 13267A, during the 1 st week of the Discontinuation Period (Weeks 9), subjects in Lu AA21004 10, 15, or 20 mg treatment groups discontinued Lu AA21004 treatment and received placebo, subjects in placebo group continued placebo, and subjects in duloxetine 60 mg group received duloxetine 30 mg.
