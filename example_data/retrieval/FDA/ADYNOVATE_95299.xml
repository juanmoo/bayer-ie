<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Executive Summary</head><p>ADYNOVATE or BAX 855 (Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), PEGylated; rFVIII, PEGylated) is a lyophilized protein manufactured in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. The fusion protein consists of a full length form of recombinant antihemophilic factor to the marketed Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant) product, ADVATE) covalently conjugated to a polyethylene glycol (PEG) reagent. The product consists of a mixture of rFVIII molecules with varying degrees of PEGylation (varying ratios in the number of molecules of PEG moiety conjugated covalently to each rFVIII moiety) with the mean ratio being</p><p>The PEG enables an increase of the plasma halflife through the reduction of the LRP-1 receptor-mediated clearance of the factor VIII molecule. As a result, ADYNOVATE is longer-acting and was developed for intravenous replacement therapy or prophylaxis on a less frequent basis than standard regimens in adult and adolescent patients with hemophilia A. The proposed indications include (b) (4) <ref type="bibr">(b) (4)</ref> treatment and control of bleeding episodes and routine prophylaxis in adolescents and adults. To support licensure for the proposed indications, the clinical development program for ADYNOVATE included data from a non-randomized open-label 2-arm treatment study evaluating efficacy, safety and PK where Previously Treated Patient (PTP) subjects age 12 and above with severe Hemophilia A received either a prophylactic regimen of 45 IU/kg twice weekly (Arm A, n = 121) for at least 50 exposure days (ED) or six months (whichever was longer), or an on-demand dosing regimen using doses ranging from 10 to 60 IU/kg (Arm B, n = 17) for at least six months. A safety and efficacy study in pediatric subjects less than 12 years of age is now ongoing, but had not enrolled any subjects at the time of BLA submission. In the BLA, data for subjects less than 12 years was provided for a very limited number of subjects. Thus the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic profiles of ADYNOVATE have not been established in pediatric patients less than 12 years old.</p><p>A total of 159 previously treated patients (PTPs) were enrolled in the study and 138 subjects were used for the Full Analysis Set (FAS) of safety and efficacy in the treatment phase. There were a total of 17 adolescents age 12 to less than 16 years and 121 adults age 16 to 65 years in the FAS. All subjects were male with the majority being White (75.4%) or Asian (23.9%). Overall, ADYNOVATE was effective in prophylactic and ondemand dosing in adolescent and adult hemophilia A subjects.</p><p>Demographics and baseline characteristics were similar in both treatment arms with the exception of a higher percentage of zero target joints at screening in subjects in the prophylaxis arm (32% in the prophylaxis arm vs. 12% in the on-demand arm). The mean number of target joints per subject was 1.60 in the prophylaxis arm and 2.18 in the ondemand arm. Of the 121 prophylaxis subjects, 21 were previously managed on an ondemand regimen prior to the study whereas all 17 on-demand subjects had never received prophylaxis. There were no entry criteria for the minimum number of bleeding episodes for subjects in either arm. (The historical annualized bleeding rate (ABR) in patients with severe hemophilia A typically ranges between 20 to 50 or more bleeding episodes per year.) Using a negative binomial model to estimate ABR, the mean [median] ABR in the treatment analysis population set or safety analysis set (SAS) population was 4.3 <ref type="bibr">[1.9]</ref> in the prophylaxis arm (N=120) and <ref type="bibr">43.4 [41.9]</ref> in the on-demand arm (N=17). Thus the use of routine prophylaxis in the dosage and frequency prescribed was associated in this trial with a 90% reduction in the mean ABR compared to the rate observed during ondemand therapy. This difference in the mean ABR between treatment arms was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.0001). The hypothesis test for the primary efficacy endpoint required statistically significant (p&lt;0.5) results in ratio of the ABR in the prophylactic arm compared to the ABR with episodic treatment in the on-demand treatment arm. This study met statistical significance for the primary efficacy assessment. Notwithstanding the higher percentage of subjects with zero target joints in the routine prophylaxis arm and the somewhat lower number of mean target joints per subject in that arm, this reviewer concluded that differences in baseline characteristics and demographics in the two treatment arms were insufficient to introduce major bias in the study efficacy outcomes and would not explain the 90% lower ABR in the routine prophylaxis arm vis-Ã -vis the on-demand treatment arm. This conclusion was reinforced by the results of subgroup analyses according to target joint status at baseline and whether subjects had previously used routine prophylaxis, all of which consistently demonstrated a substantially lower ABR in the routine prophylaxis subgroups.</p><p>The elimination half-life of ADYNOVATE is 14.3 hours compared to an average halflife of 8-12 hours in non-fusion protein plasma-derived or recombinant FVIII products. The mean dose per prophylaxis infusion was 44.4 IU/kg with a median dosing interval of 3.6 days. Of the subjects who received routine prophylaxis, ninety-three percent reduced their pre-study FVIII dosing frequency by 30% or more when compared to the on-study frequency. Additionally, 70.4% of subjects in the prophylactic arm were able to reduce the frequency of dosing from their pre-study prophylactic treatment regimens by at least one less prophylactic infusion per week after switching to ADYNOVATE for prophylaxis. Nevertheless, it bears mention that twice-weekly dosing remains within the range of existing routine prophylaxis regimens recommended for other [non-fusion protein] Antihemophilic Factor (Human) products.</p><p>A total of 591 bleeds were treated during the ~6 month efficacy evaluation period with 361 bleeds recorded for on-demand subjects and 230 bleeds for subjects in the prophylaxis arm. Eighty-five percent of the total bleeds required one infusion, 11% required 2 infusions and 4% required 3 or more infusions. Of the 120 subjects on prophylaxis, 38% experienced no bleeds. In contrast, in the on-demand arm, zero% of subjects experienced no bleeds. For each bleeding episode, subjects were asked to rate the efficacy of ADYNOVATE on a 4-point scale from excellent (four points) to no response (one point). The percent of the bleeding episodes not rated for efficacy was 0.5%. Of rated bleeding episodes, 95.2% were rated as excellent or good, 3% as fair and 1.2% as no response.</p><p>The adverse event profile of ADYNOVATE was most commonly headache (2%), nasopharyngitis (2%), upper respiratory infection (1.3%), arthralgia (1.3%) and back pain (0.7%). FVIII inhibitor formation was not observed during the pivotal study. Seven subjects who tested negative at screening developed transient IgG antibodies against FVIII or PEG-FVIII at 1 visit or 2 consecutive study visits after exposure to ADYNOVATE. Antibodies were transient and not detectable at subsequent visits or at completion of the study. None of the 137 subjects included in the SAS developed a persistent binding antibody response against FVIII, PEG-FVIII, PEG or CHO proteins during the study. Nine subjects showed pre-existing antibodies against FVIII, PEG-FVIII or PEG prior to first exposure to ADYNOVATE. A risk assessment analysis was performed by the sponsor and demonstrated no clinically significant adverse events, lack of therapeutic effect, or alterations in pharmacokinetics. This reviewer agrees with the sponsor's risk assessment analysis concerning the lack of clinically significant adverse reactions and the absence of instances of lack of therapeutic effect. The potential consequences of an immune reaction can range from development of binding antibodies without any clinical significance to rare but severe life-threatening conditions, including allergic reactions.</p><p>The benefit to risk profile for ADYNOVATE remains favorable despite the seven subjects with transient binding antibodies to FVIII as the inhibitor assays performed on subsequent samples were negative and there was no observed clinical significance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Demographic Information: Subgroup Demographics and Analysis Summary</head><p>All subjects were male. The median age was 23 years. The ratio of ABR among routine prophylaxis group adolescent subjects (n = 15) divided by the corresponding value among on-demand adolescent subjects (n = 2) subjects was 0.17, and was not statistically significant (p = 0.06). The inconclusive results were due to limitations of statistical power with only 2 adolescents subjects included in the analysis for the on-demand arm. The PK results obtained in adolescents and adults were comparable. The mean ABR in the prophylaxis group of adolescent subjects was similar to the mean ABR in the prophylaxis group of adult subjects. Thus, based on the ABR and PK results in these age groups, it is reasonable to conclude that efficacy for routine prophylaxis to reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adolescent and adult age groups is comparable.</p><p>Within the racial subgroups, the ratio of mean ABR among Whites in the prophylaxis arm to that in the on-demand arm was 0.07 (95% CI: 0.04 -0.15). Among Asians, the ratio of mean ABR in the prophylaxis arm to that in the on-demand arm was 0.22 (95% CI: 0.08 -0.62). There were no black subjects in the on-demand arm and only one in the prophylaxis arm. The latter subject had a mean ABR of 1.8.</p><p>The limited sample size in African Americans and Hispanics makes it challenging it to reach conclusions about the efficacy of ADYNOVATE in these races. Since the predilection for clinical bleeding is primarily dependent on the degree of factor VIII deficiency, race related differences in efficacy of ADYNOVATE are expected to be minimal. Therefore, it is reasonable to extrapolate the efficacy data from Whites and Asians to the other ethnic groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Clinical and Regulatory Background</head><p>There are numerous rFVIII products licensed for marketing, none of these are PEGylated rFVIII products. Please refer to section 2.2 for a detailed list of FDA approved products available for the treatment of Hemophilia A. These products have been approved in adults and children with Hemophilia A for the control and prevention of bleeding episodes, perioperative management of bleeding and routine prophylaxis to reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes and the risk of joint damage. (The language of the indications varies somewhat between licensed products.)</p><p>The development of activity-neutralizing antibodies (inhibitor) to a FVIII product is the main safety concern across this class of products. Previously untreated patients (PUPs) are at higher risk of developing inhibitors.</p><p>Although regulatory decisions for approval of these products are generally based on studies in previously treated patients, the FDA evaluates the safety data from previously untreated patients when available to further assess the immunogenicity and safety of these products.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls</head><p>ADYNOVATE (Antihemophilic Factor, Recombinant, PEGylated) is an extended halflife (T 1/2 ) recombinant human coagulation factor VIII (Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant); rFVIII) modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. The mean number of PEG moieties per rFVIII molecule is ADYNOVATE is manufactured using Baxter's Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant) which is also the active substance in Baxter's licensed product ADVATE. ADYNOVATE is manufactured by covalently binding a branched PEG reagent with a molecular weight of 20 kDa to ADVATE. No human or animal materials are employed during the manufacturing process of ADYNOVATE.</p><p>Chemical modification with PEG is a well-established method to improve the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile by extending T 1/2 and circulation of therapeutic proteins. PEGylation using high molecular weight polyethylene glycols (&gt;10 kDa) is an important tool employed to increase the size of therapeutic proteins. While PEGs with a molecular weight of &lt;30 kDa would be expected to be excreted via the kidney, PEGylated rFVIII has a molecular weight of approximately 280 kDa which exceeds the size for renal clearance. The clearance of endogenous FVIII occurs through interaction with low density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LRP-1), primarily in the liver. PEGylation of rFVIII alters the interaction with LRP-1 by decreasing receptor-binding capacity, although binding affinity remains unaffected. As a result, PEGylation may extend FVIII T 1/2 due to reduced binding of the PEG conjugated FVIII to LRP-1 for liver clearance.</p><p>The purification process includes integration of a virus inactivation step (solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment). The potency (in international units, IU) is determined using an in vitro one-stage clotting assay against the World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard for factor VIII concentrate.</p><p>The final product is a sterile, non-pyrogenic, preservative-free, lyophilized preparation for intravenous (IV) injection.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(b) (4), (b) (6) (b) (4), (b) (6) (b) (4)</formula></div>

Safety was assessed in terms of notable changes from baseline laboratory values, incidence of adverse events and inhibitor formation, while efficacy was determined by number of bleeding episodes with ADYNOVATE per subject annualized over the study period (i.e. comparison of prophylactic Arms A versus on-demand Arm B), as well as the hemostatic response to administration of the product for bleeding episodes.</p><p>The detailed primary objectives of the trial were as follows:</p><p>â¢ To compare the annualized bleeding rates (ABR) between subjects who received a prophylactic dosing regimen with those who received an on-demand regimen Secondary objectives:</p><p>â¢ To determine the immunogenicity of ADYNOVATE (Inhibitory antibodies to FVIII; Binding antibodies (IgG and IgM) to FVIII, PEG-FVIII, and PEG; Anti-CHO antibodies) â¢ To determine the safety of ADYNOVATE as assessed by occurrence of AEs and changes in vital signs and clinical laboratory parameters following ADYNOVATE administration â¢ To determine the PK parameters of ADYNOVATE following initial and repeat administrations after at least 50 EDs compared to PK parameters of ADVATE.</p><p>(Primary PK parameters: Plasma half-life (T 1/2 ); Mean residence time (MRT); Total body clearance (CL); Incremental recovery (IR)) â¢ To estimate the rate of success of ADYNOVATE for treatment of bleeding episodes â¢ To characterize ADYNOVATE for treatment of bleeding episodes through the number of ADYNOVATE infusions needed for the treatment of a bleeding episode and through the length of intervals between bleeding episodes â¢ To compare the total weight-adjusted consumption of ADYNOVATE for each regimen â¢ To assess changes from baseline in the following patient-reported outcome measures (PROs): Bleeding and pain severity as measured using the Haemo-SYM questionnaire and health related quality of life (HRQoL) as assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire Exploratory objectives:</p><p>â¢ To assess health utility, using the EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D) assessment tool, patient satisfaction, patient activity levels and health resource use, over time for subjects receiving ADYNOVATE Reviewer comment: The primary objective of comparing the efficacy of prophylactic to on-demand therapy is consistent with the general approach to evaluation of this class of products. The comparison of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of the investigational product to an approved product is consistent with prior regulatory approaches to evaluation of efficacy of this class of product.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.2">Design Overview</head><p>The treatment phase of the trial was a phase 2/3 open-label, non-randomized design intended as the pivotal study for licensure. A minimum of 150 EDs to a factor VIII preparation was a pre-enrollment requirement for a planned enrollment of 132 with approximately 119 anticipated evaluable adolescent and adult male PTPs with severe hemophilia A.</p><p>The choice of prophylaxis or on-demand treatment depended on the subject's previous history of FVIII treatment regimen. The first 17 subjects previously treated on-demand were enrolled into the on-demand arm and the subsequent subjects previously treated with on-demand treatment were assigned to the routine prophylaxis arm, as were all subjects previously treated with routine prophylaxis. After signing the consent form, all subjects were treated with ADVATE either on-demand only or for routine prophylaxis until the screening procedure was completed and the PK or efficacy portions of the trial commenced. There were two treatment arms in the study and a subset of 25 subjects in the routine prophylaxis arm underwent initial and repeat PK evaluation. ADVATE was used as a comparator to ADYNOVATE in all subjects in the PK subgroup of the study. Subjects first received ADVATE in PK-1 followed by ADYNOVATE in PK-2. ADYNOVATE was further re-assessed (PK-3) after completing at least 50 exposure days in order to evaluate whether the PK properties remained consistent Arm A subjects received a twice weekly prophylaxis dose of 45 Â± 5 IU/kg to ensure that a majority of subjects maintained FVIII levels above 1% at all times. Duration of prophylaxis was â¥ 50 EDs (N=115 subjects planned), or 6 months Â±2 weeks, whichever occurred last. Prophylactic dosing was administered twice weekly, at 3day, 4 day, or 3.5 day intervals.</p><p>Arm B was an on-demand treatment arm with suggested dose ranges consistent with the proposed ADYNOVATE prescribing information and international guidelines (10 to 60 Â± 5 IU/kg) for an approximate duration of 6 months (N=17 subjects planned). One additional infusion to maintain hemostasis when given within 48 hours after bleed resolution was also acceptable.</p><p>The planned sample size for the treatment study phase was 115 subjects on prophylaxis and up to 17 subjects using an on-demand schedule.</p><p>Treatment response for bleeding episodes was assessed by individual subjects using a four-point efficacy rating scale. Efficacy was pre-defined as a response of good or excellent. The definitions for each rating are described in the table 1 below and include at least one objective criterion. Description Excellent Full relief of pain and cessation of objective signs of bleeding (e.g., swelling, tenderness and decreased range of motion in the case of musculoskeletal hemorrhage) after a single infusion. No additional infusion is required for the control of bleeding. Administration of further infusions to maintain hemostasis would not affect the scoring Good</p><p>Definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding after a single infusion. Possibly requires more than 1 infusion for complete resolution. Fair</p><p>Probable and/or slight relief of pain and slight improvement in signs of bleeding after a single infusion. Required more than 1 infusion for complete resolution None</p><p>No improvement or condition worsens.</p><p>Bleeding episodes in the prophylaxis group were also treated with ADYNOVATE. Rescue therapy with ADVATE was permissible if an inadequate response to on-demand therapy with ADYNOVATE was observed, as assessed by the subject and/or his physician.</p><p>FVIII activity trough levels were to be measured at each study visit (baseline, week 2 Â± 5 days and week 4 Â± 1 week, after 10 to 15 EDs, month 3 Â± 2 weeks, and at study completion/termination) after an adequate wash-out period of at least 84 to 96 h following the previous infusion of ADYNOVATE and of at least 72 hours following the infusion of ADVATE. Trough levels were generally only assessed in prophylaxis subjects, and were optional in on-demand subjects, as they could not always be adequately planned.</p><p>All FVIII activity blood samples were to be analyzed using the one-stage clotting assay as the primary assay while the chromogenic assay was performed as supportive data. FVIII antigen was measured using an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen for the pre-infusion sample only in PK subset was measured using an assay.</p><p>Inhibitory antibodies to FVIII were measured by the Bethesda assay at each study visit. All testing was done at the central laboratory in one batch. The overall study duration was 78 weeks and subjects were given the option to continue treatment with ADYNOVATE in the extension study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer comment:</head><p>The selection of the population is representative of the target population with severe hemophilia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.4">Study Treatments or Agents Mandated by the Protocol</head><p>The planned prophylaxis regimen was an intravenous 45 IU/kg dose of ADYNOVATE twice weekly (Arm A) for a period of six months or for at least 50 exposure days, whichever came later. Changes in dose and frequency, whenever clinically indicated, could be made at the discretion of the investigator, but there were specific criteria in the protocol for raising the routine prophylaxis dose to 60 IU/kg twice weekly if subjects (a) had two target joint bleeds in a consecutive two month period or (b) had a single nontarget joint bleed or (c) had a trough FVIII level &lt; 1% and the investigator concluded they were at increased risk of bleeding as a consequence. Subjects in the on-demand group (Arm B) were treated with ADYNOVATE at doses ranging from 10-60 IU/kg depending on the type and severity of the bleeding episode.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.5">Directions for Use</head><p>The anticipated intravenous doses for prophylaxis were 45 + 5 IU/kg. On-demand treatment regimens were based on international recommendations for licensed FVIII products with doses ranging from 10-60 IU/kg.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.6">Sites and Centers</head><p>The trial was a multi-investigator, multicenter, international study. A total of 159 male subjects were enrolled at 72 investigational sites worldwide.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.7">Surveillance/Monitoring</head><p>The safety of this study was reviewed by a clinical dosing committee and study management team at the subject level. Safety was also monitored by an independent data and safety monitoring committee (DSMC), composed of six experts in the field of hemophilia clinical care and research who met at least annually at specified time points for data review as well as on an as needed basis. The trial's screening assessments are provided below in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 4</ref>. Physical examinations, medical histories, and concomitant medications were assessed. Adverse events were recorded in subject diaries and reviewed at each visit. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.8">Endpoints and Criteria for Study Success</head><p>Efficacy endpoints included the annualized number of breakthrough bleeding episodes during the efficacy period in the prophylaxis arm compared to the on-demand arm (primary endpoint) and assessment of treatment response on a four-point rating scale by subjects and physicians (secondary endpoint), as well as the number of infusions used to treat bleeding episodes. Safety was determined by reporting of adverse events by subjects and investigators, vital signs, and routine safety laboratory testing. Subjects recorded adverse events in their electronic diaries and were questioned at the scheduled evaluations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.9">Statistical Considerations &amp; Statistical Analysis Plan</head><p>The ADVATE prophylaxis study results were used for the sample size evaluation of the ADYNOVATE study. In the ADVATE prophylaxis study, the mean ABR in the ondemand arm (ITT analysis, N=66 subjects) was 48.9 (SD=21.4). The range of ABRs extended from 13.0 to 120.5. The wide range of ABRs in the on-demand arm suggested that a more conservative approach was needed for sample size estimation. To avoid underestimation, a value of one standard deviation lower was chosen and a mean of 27.5 was assumed. In the same ADVATE study, the mean ABR in the prophylaxis arm (ITT analysis, N=66 subjects) was 3.8 (SD=5.4).</p><p>Prophylaxis treatment in this ADYNOVATE trial was considered successful if the upper limit of the 95% CI for the ratio between treatment regimens (ABR prophylaxis /ABR on-demand ) did not exceed 0.5 (corresponding to a 50% reduction of the mean ABR compared to the on-demand treatment).</p><p>For the secondary efficacy endpoint consisting of the proportion of bleeding episodes treated with ADYNVATE rated excellent or good, the lower bound of the 95% CI had to be above 70% for a successful outcome.</p><p>Statistical plans for safety and efficacy included descriptive statistics, calculations of ABR and treatment success (excellent or good efficacy rating) using confidence interval approaches. Annualized bleeding rates were calculated. Sample size calculations were presented in section 9.7.3 of final clinical study report. The planned sample size for the treatment study phase was 115 subjects on prophylaxis and up to 17 subjects using an ondemand schedule assuming a 10% failed screening and drop-out rate.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Routine Prophylaxis</head><p>ADYNOVATE was demonstrated to be effective in hemostasis in hemophilia A subjects. The mean unadjusted annualized bleeding rate was 4.7 in the prophylaxis arm compared to a rate of 40.8 in the on-demand arm (See table 4a below). Using a negative binomial regression model, taking into account the fixed effect of regimen (prophylaxis vs. ondemand), stratum (presence or absence of target joints at screening), age at screening as a continuous covariate, and the duration of the observation period for efficacy as an offset,the estimated annualized bleeding rate was in theSAS population was 4.3 in the prophylaxis arm compared to a rate of 43.4 in the on-demand arm (See <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">table 5 below)</ref>. There was a statistically significant reduction of 90% in the annualized bleeding rate in the routine prophylaxis arm compared to the on-demand arm (analysis of entire safety analysis set/treatment analyses population analysis set cohort). Prophylactic subjects were dosed at a median dose of 43.58 IU/kg twice weekly (range 41.28 -46.92 IU/kg) for the treatment duration of 6 months. Subjects in the prophylaxis arm were dosed at an interval of twice weekly and averaged a median interval of 3.56 days (range 3.52 to 3.68 days) during the efficacy period. Demographics and baseline characteristics were relatively similar in both arms with the exception of a higher percentage of zero target joints at screening in subjects in the prophylaxis arm. Of the 121 prophylaxis subjects in the FAS, 21 were previously managed on an on-demand regimen prior to the study whereas all 17 on-demand subjects had never received prophylaxis. There were no entry criteria for the number of bleeding episodes for subjects in the on-demand arm given the well-established historical annualized bleeding rate (ABR) in patients with severe hemophilia A ranges between 20 to 50 or more bleeding episodes per year. The applicant concluded that ADYNOVATE is effective in reducing bleeding compared to on-demand use when administered as routine prophylaxis at intervals of every 3.5 days in adolescent and adult subjects with hemophilia A. This reviewer agrees with the applicant's conclusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment and control of bleeding episodes</head><p>For each bleeding episode, subjects were asked to rate the efficacy of ADYNOVATE on a four-point scale from excellent to no response. The percent of the bleeding episodes reported as not rated for efficacy was 0.5%. Of those rated for efficacy, 95.2% were rated as excellent or good, 3% as fair and 1.2% as no response <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">(See table 8</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.11.2">Analyses of Secondary Endpoints</head><p>A total of 591 bleeds were treated during the efficacy period with 361 bleeds recorded for on-demand subjects and 230 bleeds for subjects in the prophylaxis arm. Eighty-five percent of the total bleeds required one infusion, 11% required 2 infusions and 4% required 3 or more infusions <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">(table 5)</ref>.</p><p>Of the 120 subjects on prophylaxis, 38% experienced no bleeds. All 17 on-demand arm subjects experienced bleeds.</p><p>No significant differences in the HR QoL were observed over time in the prophylactic arm relative to on-demand subjects between baseline and follow-up. In subjects on prophylaxis, statistically significant improvements between baseline and follow-up were seen only for the physical component score, role physical score, physical functioning score and social functioning score for the SF-36. Overall for all subjects, HR QoL did not show a marked improvement and is considered underpowered and exploratory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.11.3">Subpopulation Analyses</head><p>Adolescent Sub-Study:</p><p>Of the 137 subjects included in the safety analysis set (modified ITT population), 25 were 12 to &lt;18 years of age. The baseline characteristics of adolescent subjects were similar to adults with the exception that adult subjects as expected had a greater proportion of target joints and more prevalent arthropathy. The mean clearance in adolescents aged 12 to &lt; 18 years of age was slightly greater than that in the adults. The median elimination half-life of ADYNOVATE in adolescents is 13.14 hours (range 11.21-16.61 hours) which did not differ significantly from the half-life observed in adults. PK results in adolescents obtained at the beginning and end of the study were comparable.</p><p>The ratio of ABR among routine prophylaxis group adolescent subjects (n = 15) divided by the corresponding value among on-demand adolescent subjects (n = 2) subjects was 0.17, and was not statistically significant (p = 0.06). The inconclusive results <ref type="table">(table 9)</ref> were due to limitations of statistical power with only 2 adolescents subjects included in the analysis for the on-demand arm. The small number of adolescent subjects in the ondemand arm also limited other comparisons such as types of bleeding episodes experienced in the two arms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 9 ABR Primary Analysis with Age Subgroups (treated analysis population set)</head><p>Analysis of mean ABR by race using the negative binomial regression model yielded a higher point estimate for Asians compared to whites for the ratio for mean ABR in the routine prophylaxis arm divided by mean ABR in the on-demand arm; however, the confidence interval for the ratio was wide in the case of the smaller Asian subgroup. The ratio of mean ABR among whites in the prophylaxis arm to that in the on-demand arm was 0.07 (95% CI: 0.04 -0.15). Among Asians, the ratio of mean ABR in the prophylaxis arm to that in the on-demand arm was 0.22 (95% CI: 0.08 -0.62. There were no black subjects in the on-demand arm and only one in the prophylaxis arm. The latter subject had a mean ABR of 1.8.</p><p>Similar to adults, 88% of the total bleeds in adolescents required one infusion, 10% required 2 infusions and 2% required 3 or more infusions.</p><p>For each bleeding episode, subjects were asked to rate the efficacy of ADYNOVATE on a 4-point scale from excellent to no response.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.12.1">Methods</head><p>Safety of study subjects was assessed in terms of occurrence of AEs and ARs, use of concomitant medication, changes in vital signs and clinical laboratory assessments of hematology, chemistry, lipids, and immunogenicity (inhibitory antibodies to FVIII, binding antibodies to FVIII, PEG, PEG-FVIII, and CHO protein). Only treatmentemergent adverse events (AEs) were analyzed in detail. Immunogenicity testing was performed by ELISA. Although bleeding was monitored and considered an efficacy outcome, subjects were also monitored for development of inhibitors that might predispose to bleeding. The protocol included pre-specified definitions of adverse reactions including severity, seriousness, and relatedness to ADYNOVATE administration. A DSMB monitored the study.</p><p>Pre-infusion baseline levels of factor VIII, inhibitory, and non-inhibitory antibodies were also assessed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.12.2">Overview of Adverse Events</head><p>The Safety Analysis Set for trial 261201 included 137 subjects who received at least 1 dose of ADYNOVATE. The summary of exposure is depicted in table 13 below. There was one death considered unrelated to ADYNOVATE (see section 6.2.12.3) and no cases of hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, inhibitors, or thromboembolic complications.</p><p>Four subjects discontinued treatment with ADYNOVATE prematurely due to AEs, of which three were considered unrelated and one was considered unlikely related. The latter subject (40001), a 43 year-old white male with history of prior HCV infection in 2012, discontinued after 29 EDs for treatment-emergent progressive rises in AST and ALT to &gt; 10x the ULN (330 and 730 U/L, respectively) which was attributed to HCV reactivation. HCV (and anti-HBV surface and core) antibody tests were positive at baseline; at an unscheduled visit during the trial, this subject's HCV viral load was extremely high at 25,800,000 RNA IU/mL. The Chinese ovary cell line origin, lack of animal or human protein additives and viral inactivation procedures in the manufacture of this recombinant product would make this SAE extremely unlikely to be product related in the absence of a major breakdown in GMP for which we have no other evidence.</p><p>There were 73 subjects (53%) who reported at least 1 AE totaling 171 adverse events throughout the pivotal study. AEs reported at the highest incidence were consistent with common occurrences in the general population including: headache (2%), nasopharyngitis (2%), upper respiratory infection (1.3%), arthralgia (1.3%) and back pain (0.7%). The 3 subjects with headache upon detailed review were found to be non-serious in severity.</p><p>There were 8 AEs, experienced by 7 subjects, considered by the investigator as possibly related to ADYNOVATE treatment due to their temporal relationship to administration. The applicant did not agree that 2 AEs of injection site pain were related to the product because a two hour delay elapsed between product infusion and onset of the AEs and because these AEs were associated with the first two infusions but not any subsequent infusions. The sponsor also did not agree that hyperbilirubinemia observed in one subject with a history of stable HCV and resolved HBV infection and whose baseline bilirubin was mildly elevated was related to ADYNOVATE. FDA review concurred with the sponsor's assessment of ARs. The related AEs included 4 cases of headache in 3 subjects (2.2%), flushing, nausea, and diarrhea (each reported in 1 subject [0.7%] each). The flushing was not considered an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction because it was an isolated case that did not reoccur with repeat administration. There were no patterns of increased consumption or other patterns suggestive of inhibitor formation. Non-neutralizing binding FVIII antibodies were present in 9 subjects (N=137) at screening prior to any dosing, of which two subjects tested positive at each time point throughout the trial. Treatment-emergent non-neutralizing anti-FVIII antibodies developed transiently in 7 subjects at one or two time points during the pivotal study. Transient antibodies were not detectable at subsequent visits or at completion of the study. None of the subjects who had positive inhibitors at any time point demonstrated allergic symptoms or any other concerning symptoms that would likely be related to inhibitor development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.12.3">Deaths</head><p>One subject died 21 days after he discontinued treatment with ADYNOVATE secondary to a diagnosis of neuroendocrine carcinoma and this was appropriately considered unrelated to treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.12.4">Nonfatal Serious Adverse Events</head><p>Five SAEs were reported during the study and none were considered possibly related to ADYNOVATE. There were no patterns suggestive of inhibitor formation. The SAEs included osteoarthritis, herpes zoster infection, humerus fracture, muscle hemorrhage secondary to a motorcycle accident and neuroendocrine carcinoma. Clinical review is consistent with the applicant's assessment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.12.5">Common Adverse Events</head><p>The most common adverse events following ADYNOVATE administration were headache (3% of subjects), nasopharyngitis (2%), upper respiratory infection (1.3%), arthralgia (1.3%) and back pain (0.7%). The most commonly reported adverse reactions after ADYNOVATE administration were headache (3%) and nausea (1.2%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.12.6">Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)</head><p>Events of special interest included thromboses, hemolysis, and immunogenicity. No case of confirmed inhibitor, thrombosis or hemolysis was detected.</p><p>Inhibitory antibodies to FVIII were measured using (b) (4)</p><p>Bethesda assay. Validated screening and confirmatory ELISA assay was used to detect binding antibodies against CHO, FVIII, PEG-FVIII and PEG. No anti-CHO antibodies were detected during the study.</p><p>As noted previously, nine out of 137 subjects demonstrated binding antibodies against FVIII (range in specificity 1:80 to 1:160 titers) at screening prior to dosing, of which tw0 subjects remained positive at each time point throughout the trial. In addition, 7 subjects developed binding antibodies against FVIII during the study. No clinically relevant abnormalities were reported in these subjects. Baxter submitted a comprehensive risk assessment analysis on the formation of these antibodies. The antibody formation was considered transient as subsequent testing at study completion was negative in all subjects.</p><p>Subjects with binding antibodies at any time point during the study are described below with titers in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Tables 15 &amp; 16</ref>. Binding antibodies to FVIII were detected in 7 subjects at one or more time points during the study but none were neutralizing. None of the subjects with treatment-emergent positive binding antibodies to FVIII remained positive at the time of study completion. Seven subjects had transient positivity for PEG and FVIII at one point during the study but in-depth review of patient narratives for these subjects showed no associated clinical abnormalities. The applicant's conclusion that transient antibodies had no impact on safety and efficacy, no temporal association with adverse events is well supported by the data and risk assessment analysis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1">Safety Assessment Methods</head><p>The safety issues of interest were adverse events in general, thrombogenicity and inhibitors. The integrated safety population includes all subjects in all phases. Since all safety assessments were descriptive, no additional methods were required to pool them together.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2">Safety Database</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.1">Studies/Clinical Trials Used to Evaluate Safety</head><p>The pivotal treatment study and initial phase 1 PK sub-study were the completed trials used to evaluate safety. In addition, the ISS submitted 27 March 2015 included an additional 15 subjects treated with ADYNOVATE in the ongoing surgery trial (n = 11 additional individual subjects) and the ongoing pediatric PTP trial (n = 4 subjects). Thus a total of 169 individual subjects were analyzed in the ISS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.2">Overall Exposure, Demographics of Pooled Safety Populations</head><p>The median exposure to ADYNOVATE among these 169 subjects was 96 EDs. Exposure days for children under age 12 were quite limited.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 18</ref> lists the adverse reactions reported during clinical studies in â¥ 1% of subjects. A single AE of blood pressure increase was reported within 24 hours of an infusion but is not included in the above table because of negative rechallenge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.4">Safety Results</head><p>None of the 169 individual (unique) subjects who received at least one infusion of ADYNOVATE developed neutralizing antibodies to factor VIII and no events of hypersensitivity were reported.</p><p>Although a persistent binding antibody response was not observed in any of the 169 subjects from all the completed and ongoing studies, 13 total subjects had pre-existing antibodies to factor VIII (n=1), PEG-factor VIII (n=12) and/or PEG (n=3) prior to the first exposure to ADYNOVATE. Additionally, 8 subjects who tested negative at screening developed transient IgG antibodies against factor VIII (n= 5), or PEG-FVIII (n= 3) at one or two consecutive study visits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.4.1">Deaths</head><p>There was one fatality in the ISS (in the pivotal trial) that was appropriately considered unrelated to ADYNOVATE (neuroendocrine carcinoma).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.4.2">Nonfatal Serious Adverse Events</head><p>There were a total of 16 SAEs (15 nonfatal and 1 fatal) reported in the March 1015 ISS. The 5/137 (3.6%) SAEs reported in the pivotal trial were unlikely related to ADYNOVATE based on detailed review of case reports. These 5 SAEs from trial 261201 are listed as follows:   the 2 nd case, but the "cluster" finding of 2 cases following ADYNOVATE treatment merits comment. The fact that both cases recovered despite continued administration of ADYNOVATE argues against a causal role of ADYNOVATE in these pancreatitis cases, unless the lots of ADYNOVATE administered following hospitalization were different from the lots administered most recently prior to the development of symptoms of pancreatitis. The applicant was contacted in this regard, but there was ambuigity/incompletess in the records of the specific visit dates these subjects received specific lots of investigational product. Nevertheless, in the absence of an alternative etiology in the first case it was decided to nclude mention of these two cases of acute pancreatitis in the ADYNOVATE package insert.</p><p>One SAE in a 15 year-old boy consisted of a splenic hematoma and peritoneal fluid accumulation documented on abdominal ultrasound due to blunt trauma coded as splenic hemorrhage and splenic rupture. This subject was managed non-surgically with bed rest and serial abdominal ultrasound monitoring which revealed a 2 x 1.5 cm splenic defect that was documented to heal completely with observation and daily administration of 46 IU/kg of ADYNOVATE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.4.3">Study Dropouts/Discontinuations</head><p>A total of 21 subjects were discontinued from the pivotal study after signing of the consent form but before treatment secondary to screening failure, and 12 subjects discontinued after treatment for reasons including withdrawn consent, adverse events (n = 4), and non-compliance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.4.4">Common Adverse Events</head><p>The most common adverse reactions were headache (3% of subjects) and nausea (1.2% of subjects).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.4.5">Clinical Test Results</head><p>No safety signals were seen in the routine laboratory results, physical examinations, or vital signs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.5.1">Immunogenicity (Safety)</head><p>There was no pattern of increased consumption of product as evidenced by a consistent average number of infusions and average weight-adjusted consumption per month. The absence of increased consumption and similar IVR and estimated terminal half-life at the start and end of the trial among the PK substudy subjects in the routine prophylaxis arm, in addition to negative modified Bethesda assay immunogenicity assay results, provide evidence against clinically significant immunogenicity mediated by neutralizing antibody against the therapeutic protein. Binding FVIII antibodies that were non-neutralizing were present in 16 subjects out of 137 at both screening prior to dosing and during the pivotal study. None of the 16 subjects showed allergic symptoms or decreased therapeutic effect. One of the subjects had a lower than average half-life at PK assessments 1 &amp; 2 which normalized at PK assessments 3. A risk assessment analysis was performed on these 16 subjects demonstrated no clinically significant adverse events, lack of therapeutic effect or lasting alterations in pharmacokinetics.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decision Factor Evidence and Uncertainties Conclusions and Reasons</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Condition</head><p>â¢ Hemophilia A is a rare condition with variable deficiency of coagulation factor VIII. â¢ Hemophilia is accompanied by bleeding into tissues and joints which can be spontaneous, post-traumatic, or perioperative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>â¢</head><p>Bleeding can be acutely devastating, such as intracranial bleeding, or chronically destructive such as hemophilic arthropathy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>â¢</head><p>Hemophilia A is a serious, progressive, life-threatening disease.</p><p>â¢</p><p>The bleeding associated with hemophilia can cause clinically significant complications. â¢ Current treatment is expensive and carries some risks including infection from use of indwelling intravenous catheters and hypersensitivity and other adverse reactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unmet Medical Need</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>â¢</head><p>There are several other recombinant factor VIII product licensed for use by FDA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>â¢</head><p>Numerous other plasma-derived factor VIII products also exist, but carry the same risks as other human plasma products, such as infection with known or future agents, acute hypersensitivity reactions, or immunogenicity with resistance to therapy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>â¢</head><p>Due to convenience and compliance issues, developing products for Hemophilia A replacement therapy that can be effective when given less frequently during routine prophylaxis is desirable. However, Recombinant AHF products that are approved for twice weekly administration for routine prophylaxis already are licensed in the U.S.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>â¢</head><p>Although alternative recombinant therapy exists for Hemophilia A, it is expensive with the average on-demand treatment costing ~$130,000/year and even higher costs for those on prophylactic therapy. Increasing the number of available licensed products could have a positive impact and allow options for hemophilia patients who remain untreated due to high costs; however, there is no guarantee that newer products will be less expensive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Benefit</head><p>â¢ ADYNOVATE has been shown to be effective for treatment of, and routine prophylaxis to reduce the frequency of spontaneous or traumatic in adolescents and adults.</p><p>â¢ ADYNOVATE in a single non-head-to-head phase 3 trial appears equally effective to currently licensed recombinant products.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risk</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>â¢</head><p>No new risks identified in this BLA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>â¢</head><p>The risk of long-term exposure to FVIII products is the development of inhibitory antibodies. Hypersensitivity reactions are expected given sufficiently large population exposure, but none were observed in the clinical trials to date. Overdose with FVIII products might be associated with thrombotic events. None were observed with ADYNOVATE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risk Management</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>â¢</head><p>Continue routine postmarketing pharmacovigilance.</p><p>â¢ No new risks identified in this BLA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">Risk-Benefit Considerations and Recommendations</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.1">Risk-Benefit Summary and Assessment</head><p>The formation of FVIII inhibitors was not observed during the pivotal study. Binding FVIII antibodies that were non-neutralizing were present in 16 subjects (N=137) at both screening prior to dosing and during the pivotal study. None of the 16 subjects showed allergic symptoms or decreased therapeutic effect. One of the subjects had a lower than average half-life at PK assessments 1 &amp; 2 which normalized at PK assessments 3. A risk assessment analysis was performed on these 16 subjects demonstrated no clinically significant adverse events, lack of therapeutic effect or lasting alterations in pharmacokinetics. No hypersensitivity or thrombotic events were observed. Two cases of acute pancreatitis appeared to be unrelated to treatment with ADYNOVATE.</p><p>Due to the effective hemostasis in treatment and control of bleeding episodes and routine prophylaxis in adolescents and adult subjects with hemophilia A, the benefits of ADYNOVATE are considered to outweigh the risks. Although ADYNOVATE has a somewhat longer half-life (1.4-1.5x) than non-fusion protein marketed rFVIII products, the extent of the practical advantage of this product has yet to be determined given that some of the currently licensed recombinant FVIII, including ADVATE, can also be dosed twice weekly for prophylaxis. The ADYNOVATE pivotal study did show that 93% of the study subjects reduced their pre-study dosing frequency by 30% which was equivalent to one less prophylactic infusion per week (i.e. twice weekly prophylaxis) and this may be of benefit to some patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.2">Discussion of Regulatory Options</head><p>The regulatory option discussed is approval of the indications of on-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes and routine prophylaxis in adolescents and adults with hemophilia A. Formalization of all ongoing studies as PMCs/PMRs, as applicable based on PREA requirements, is also recommended.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.3">Recommendations on Regulatory Actions</head><p>An approval is recommended. Implementation and completion of all postmarketing studies is also recommended. The applicant has agreed to fulfill the following PMR/PMCs: 1) Phase 3 prospective, uncontrolled, and multi-center study to evaluate PK, efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of ADYNOVATE in pediatric previously treated patients (PTPs) less than 12 years of age (Study # 261202)PREA PMR Protocols for all of the above studies have been submitted to the IND for this product and have been reviewed by FDA.

He had received an infusion of ADYNOVATE the day before he was hospitalized and continued to receive ADYNOVATE infusions in the hospital, due to rectal bleeding. On the day of admission his serum lipase was 1209 U/L and he had a leukocytosis with WBCs 15.8K. The next day his lipase was 244 U/L and his WBCs were 13.7K. A CT scan showed blood in the sigmoid colon. He had recovered and was discharged on the 3 rd day of hospitalization. No cause of the acute pancreatitis was identified.</p><p>Extension study subject 261201-109001 was a 58 year-old white male with a history of pulmonary hypertension who received his first prophylaxis dose of ADYNOVATE on 13 March 2013. He was hospitalized for pneumonia after having received an ADYNOVATE dose the prior day. Pneumonia resolved with levofloxacin and vancomycin therapy and he was discharged on . This subject was subsequently re-hospitalized for severe acute pancreatitis on 14 after having received ADYNOVATE 2 days prior to hospitalization. The patient's concomitant therapy at the time included Stavudine, Lamivudine, and Etravirine for HIV infection. He was also HCV positive. On the day prior to his hospitalization for acute pancreatitis, he developed abdominal pain which rapidly progressed over 30 min along with sweats, nausea,and dry heaves and weaknesss. He was treated first in the ER that day with odanesetron 4 mg IV which improved his nausea and pain transiently. Pancreatic edema was visible on CT. MRCP showed gallstones and peripancreatic edema. He recovered and was discharged on .</p><p>Reviewer Comment: Two cases of acute pancreatitis were diagnosed in two subjects out of 125 subjects who had entered the extension trial as of the data cutoff for the March 2015 ISS.
