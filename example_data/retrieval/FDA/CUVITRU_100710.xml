<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>GLOSSARY AESI: AE of special interest AE: AE (an untoward medical occurrence associated with use of a drug whether or not considered drug related) AR: adverse reaction (AE known to be caused by a drug) AR: alternate response (in Study NGAM-02: elevation in platelet count to ≥30 x 10 9 /L and at least double the baseline platelet count, confirmed on at least 2 separate occasions at least 7 days apart, and absence of bleeding) CI: confidence interval CSR: clinical study report CVID: common variable immunodeficiency Ig: immunoglobulin ICF: informed consent form IGIV: Immune Globulin Infusion (Human) administered intravenously IGSC: Immune Globulin Infusion (Human) administered subcutaneously PI: primary immunodeficiency PT: MedDRA preferred term QoL: quality of life SAR: serious adverse reaction SBI: serious bacterial infection SC: subcutaneous SOC: MedDRA system organ class TEAE: treatment emergent AE (untoward medical occurrence not necessarily considered drug related) XLA: X-linked agammaglobulinemia 1. Executive Summary BLA 125596/0 is intended to support use of Cuvitru (IGSC, 20%), Baxalta's subcutaneous immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement product for the treatment of primary immunodeficiency (PI) disease. Cuvitru is essentially the same product as the applicant's licensed GAMMAGARD LIQUID, 10% product (STN BL 125105) except for the and formulation steps (20% protein concentration instead of 10%). GAMMAGARD LIQUID is licensed for intravenous (IV) and SC administration in PI subjects.</p><p>To date, three IGSC products (one 20% product and two 10% products) have been licensed for the PI indication: (a) Hizentra (IGSC, 20%; CSL Behring), (b) HYQVIA (IGSC 10% co-administered with recombinant hyaluronidase; Baxalta U.S. Inc), and (c) GAMUNEX-C (IGSC 10%; Grifols Therapeutics Inc). The primary advantage of IGSC treatment over IGIV is convenience, i.e., IGSC can be self-administered at home; a disadvantage is that only small volumes can be infused over a given time, mandating multiple infusion sites per weekly treatment.</p><p>Three clinical studies were included in this original submission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Study 170904</head><p>Study 170904 was a phase 2/3, prospective, open-label, historic-controlled, multicenter (U.S., Canada) study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of Cuvitru in subjects with PI (N=77). In this 4-part ("Epoch") study, subjects received GAMMAGARD LIQUID intravenously in Epoch 1 and Cuvitru subcutaneously during Epoch 2 through Epoch 4. To account for lower bioavailability with SC versus IV administration, Cuvitru dosefinding was an iterative process that progressed from Epoch 2 (fixed SC dose equivalent to 145% of IV dose) to Epoch 3 ("Adjusted Dose" of Cuvitru every 7 days for 3 months based on pharmacokinetic (PK) data from Epoch 1 and Epoch 2) to Epoch 4 ("Individually Adapted Dose" based on a comparison of measured trough levels in Epoch 1 and Epoch 3). The primary endpoint of Study 170904 was the annualized number of serious bacterial infections (SBI).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Study 170903</head><p>Study 170903 (N=49) was a phase 2/3 study conducted in Europe with objectives similar to Study 170904. In Epoch 1, subjects received (a) KIOVIG 1 administered intravenously every 3 or 4 weeks for 13 weeks or (b) SUBCUVIA 2 administered subcutaneously every week or every other week for 12 weeks. In Epoch 2, all subjects received Cuvitru. When transitioning to Epoch 2, Epoch 1 subjects in the KIOGIV cohort received Cuvitru at the same dose of IGIV 10% as in Epoch 1, adjusted to a weekly-equivalent dose over a period of 51-weeks. The primary endpoint of Study 170903 was annualized number of SBI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Study 160601</head><p>Study 160601 was a phase 2/3, prospective, open-label, historic-controlled, multicenter (U.S.) study in male and female subjects aged 2 years and older with PI (N=49) that was designed to determine the tolerability and pharmacokinetics of GAMMAGARD LIQUID, 10% when administered IV and SC. A further aim was to evaluate efficacy in terms of acute serious bacterial infections (SBI) and total infections during SC administration.</p><p>EFFICACY <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows that Study 170904 and Study 170903 both met their primary endpoint: the point estimate of the annualized SBI rate among all subjects who received at least one dose of Cuvitru regardless of whether they completed the study (Safety Analysis Set), was 0.01 and 0.02, respectively, i.e., well below the threshold (SBI rate ≥1.0 per person year at the 1% level of significance) needed to reject the null hypothesis. Similar values were obtained for the pediatric subpopulation aged &lt;16 years (0.06 for Study 170904 and 0.00 for Study 170903). The annual rate of acute serious bacterial infections in the GAMMAGARD LIQUID SC treatment cohort of Study 160601 was 0.067 (99% upper confidence limit: 0.134). This CI was substantially lower than the goal of achieving a rate of &lt;1 SBI per person-year.</p><p>Several unrelated SBIs necessitating hospitalization were reported. One adult subject in Study 170904, a 78 year old White male with a specific antibody deficiency, experienced bilateral pneumonia during treatment with Cuvitru (Epoch 4) that lasted 6 days and required hospitalization. One pediatric subject in Study 170903 aged 11 years with XLA experienced 2 episodes of bacterial pneumonia (moderate severity); the first occurred during treatment with SUBCUVIA and the second during treatment with Cuvitru. Both subjects recovered with antibiotic therapy.</p><p>Secondary endpoints (Days off school/work, Days on antibiotics, Number of hospitalizations, Days in hospital, and Acute physician/ER visits) were consistent with achievement of the primary endpoint.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SAFETY</head><p>A total of 6675 Cuvitru infusions were administered in Study 170904 and 170903.</p><p>Serious Adverse Events (SAE) SAEs (N=10), all unrelated to study drug, were reported in 8 subjects (6.6%): 2 subjects in Study 170904 and 6 subjects in Study 170903. These events included lung adenocarcinoma, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, nasal septum deviation, brainstem infarction, enteritis, chronic sinusitis, pneumonia and rhinorrhea (the last three likely representing treatment failures due to underlying disease).</p><p>Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> shows that a high proportion of Cuvitru subjects experienced one or more TEAEs, regardless of age. All but 4 of these events were mild-moderate in intensity.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> summarizes causally related and/or temporally associated TEAEs reported at a frequency ≥5% in the Cuvitru cohort of Study 170903 and Study 170904. It shows that a substantial proportion of subjects experienced local (33.6%) and systemic (60.7%) TEAEs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment</head><p>The Integrated Summary of Safety tables categorize safety data in three ways: (a) causally related, (b) temporally associated and (c) causally related and/or temporally associated. In this reviewer's opinion, "causally related and/or temporally associated" most closely mimics a patient-oriented outcome.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> is an indirect comparison of Cuvitru versus other licensed IGSC products based on data contained in package inserts of each product. It suggests that the incidence of local reactions is lowest using Cuvitru, even when compared with other, lessconcentrated licensed IGSC, 10% products (HYQVIA and GAMMUNEX-C).  <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref>, GAMUNEX-C (IGSC, 10%) Package Insert, <ref type="bibr">Sep 2013</ref> Reviewer Comment Subcutaneous administration of therapeutic agents generally is considered to be easier, requires less time, and provides patients with greater flexibility than IV administration. While <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> appears to show that this convenience comes at some cost, i.e., a relatively "high" incidence of local TEAEs (33.6%), <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> suggests that Cuvitru actually is associated with fewer TEAEs when compared against other currently licensed IGSC products. Note: These data should be interpreted with caution since none of the products was directly compared with others in a clinical trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risk-Benefit Assessment</head><p>Clinical Reviewer: Laurence Landow STN: 125596/0 6 | P a g e</p><p>The risk-benefit assessment of Cuvitru is favorable and commensurate to other marketed IGSC products. No adverse events of special interest (AESI), e.g., TEE, hemolysis, were reported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RECOMMENDATION</head><p>I recommend an approval action be taken for this BLA.</p><p>1.1 Demographic Information: <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref> presents demographic characteristics of the study populations. The Cuvitru study population (Study 170904 and Study 170903) comprised a total of 122 subjects. Inferences based on subgroups defined by gender, race and age cannot be made because of limited sample size and absence of a contemporaneous control cohort.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">9)</ref> 48 (98.0) 46 (93.9) 3 (3.9) 0 2 (4.1) 5 (6.5) 0 1 (2.0) 2 (2.6) 1 (2.0) 0 2 (2.6) 0 0 *In Study 170904, 5 Hispanic/Latino subjects were displayed/counted under "Race" twice, once as Hispanic and once per their race. Without "Hispanic/Latino", the number of subjects totaled 77. Adapted from <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>, ISE, page 20 of 48 <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref> shows that a total of 39 pediatric subjects aged &lt;16 years were enrolled in the two Cuvitru studies. PI is characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia with or without defective antibody production. Children and adults with PI are at increased risk for recurrent bacterial and viral infections that typically affect the respiratory tract (sinusitis, bronchitis and pneumonia) but can also affect the gastrointestinal tract (gastroenteritis). Symptoms can be severe and can lead to substantial morbidity. Response to antibacterial therapy is often poor. At present, most primary immune deficiencies are not curable, but IgG products have been shown to decrease the number of severe infections and duration of hospitalization.</p><p>Replacement therapy using Ig provides antibodies to prevent viral and bacterial diseases. Use of IgG replacement therapy to reduce the incidence of viral and bacterial diseases has been applied in three therapeutic domains: (a) replacement for subjects with PI syndromes who have significant defects in antibody formation (humoral immunity); (b) provision of antibody to subjects with immunodeficiency secondary to a disease, immunosuppressive therapy or losses of IgG; and (c) as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of infectious diseases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Currently Available, Pharmacologically Unrelated Treatment(s)/Intervention(s) for the Proposed Indication(s)</head><p>General therapy for PI involves treating infections with antibiotics and preventing infections. Antibiotics may also be used to prevent infections (e.g. trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole to prevent pneumocystis carinii), <ref type="bibr">3</ref> but the mainstay of prevention lies in correcting immunodeficiency via replacement therapy using IgG products.</p><p>IgG products are licensed for the following indications: (i) Treatment of primary immunodeficiencies (ii) Prevention of bacterial infections in subjects with hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent bacterial infection caused by B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia chronic lymphocytic leukemia, CIDP, and multifocal motor neuropathy (iii)Prevention of coronary artery aneurysms in Kawasaki disease (iv) Prevention of infections, pneumonitis, and acute graft-versus-host disease after bone marrow transplantation (v) Reduction of SBI in children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (vi) Increase of platelet count in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) to prevent or control bleeding</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Safety and Efficacy of Pharmacologically Related Products</head><p>Marketed IGIV and IGSC products have demonstrated annualized SBI rates &lt;1.0 SBI/year in BLA clinical studies. The incidence of adverse reactions (AR) reported in BLA clinical studies varies according to product, route of administration, and maximal infusion rate. Because of these differences, the safety profile of each product is determined independently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Previous Human Experience with the Product</head><p>There is no previous human experience with Cuvitru, and it is not currently licensed in any other country. The manufacturing of Cuvitru is based on the currently licensed liquid Ig Baxalta product, Immune Globulin Infusion (IGI, Human), 10% Solution, marketed under the trade name GAMMAGARD LIQUID. GAMMAGARD LIQUID is licensed for IV and SC replacement therapy in PI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Summary of Pre-and Post-submission Regulatory Activity Related to the Submission</head><p>Pre-BLA meeting (April 24, 2015) 1) FDA advised Baxalta that the application should include integrated safety analyses of the clinical trials of Cuvitru with and without inclusion of data from IGIV 10% administered subcutaneously, e.g., GAMMAGARD LIQUID. 2) FDA advised Baxalta to define infusional AEs as those whose onset occurred within 72 hours of product infusion. FDA had previously advised that causally related and temporally related associated AEs within 24 hours and within 1 hour of completion of the infusion should be added as safety endpoints. 3) FDA recommended that Baxalta monitor for thrombotic events and hemolytic anemia, including testing for hemolysis at screening/baseline.</p></div>

The majority of the minor deviations consisted of "procedure not done" (77.9% of subjects) or variations in "protocol schedule" (84.9% of subjects). No subjects were excluded from the analysis due to a major protocol deviation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Review Strategy</head><p>The primary focus of this review is a phase 2/3 prospective, open label, non-controlled global trial assessing efficacy, PK, tolerability and safety (Study 170904) in adults and children &gt;2 years of age with primary immune deficiency disease (PI). A European phase 2/3 multicenter uncontrolled prospective open-label study conducted at 16 sites (170903) as well as safety and efficacy data from a supportive study (160601) also were reviewed. Due to differences in doses and/or product concentrations across the three studies, a comparison of the efficacy results was not considered feasible by Baxalta; however, the studies were described and summarized in parallel, where possible, in the Integrated Summary of Efficacy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">BLA/IND Documents That Serve as the Basis for the Clinical Review</head><p>This review is based on the following materials: − 1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">14</ref>  The study consisted of 4 Epochs. Efficacy, safety and tolerability were determined during Epochs 2 to 4 (up to 12 months).  The doses were as follows: − Epoch 1: Subjects received GAMMAGARD LIQUID intravenously every 3 to 4 weeks depending on pre-study treatment at a monthly dose equivalent to that received prior to the study to determine the AUC (AUC IV ) of total IgG. All subjects aged ≥12 years completed a PK assessment. − Epoch 2: Subjects received Cuvitru at 145% of the IV dose every 7 days in Epoch 1. Subjects (N=15) aged ≥12 years completed a PK assessment. − Epoch 3: Subjects received an "Adjusted Dose" of Cuvitru every 7 days for 3 months based on PK data from Epoch 1 and Epoch 2.</p><p>− Epoch 4: Subjects were treated with an "Individually Adapted Dose" based on a comparison of measured trough levels in Epoch 1 and Epoch 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.4.1">Directions for Use</head><p>Dosing When switching from IGIV, 10% or HYQVIA, the following formula was used: Initial weekly dose (g) = Previous IGIV dose (g) x 1.30 # of weeks between IGIV doses r IGSC treatment, the weekly dose was equiv When switching from othe alent to the weekly dose of prior IGSC treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Administration</head><p>Infusions were conducted with an electronic pump. When multiple infusion sites were used simultaneously, the rate set on the pump was rate/site x number of sites. If an AE, at least moderate in severity, occurred during an infusion, the infusion was to be completed at the infusion rate immediately below that at which the AE occurred or at a lower rate. During home treatment if no ramp-up had been performed at this infusion, it was suggested to reduce to the infusion rate advised by the investigator during the training session(s).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Infusion Rates</head><p>The initial two infusions were started at 10 mL/h/infusion site, and could be increased stepwise to a maximum of 20 mL/hr/infusion site. Adjustment of the infusion rate was based on subject tolerability; if well tolerated the infusion rate could be increased at intervals of ≥10 minutes. For subsequent infusions, if well tolerated, the infusion rate could be increased to a maximum of 60 ml/h/site.</p><p>If the initial infusions were well tolerated then subsequent infusions could begin at the maximum tolerated rate without ramp-up. If the subject did not achieve the maximum allowable rate during the initial infusions, it was permissible to increase the rate during subsequent infusions, up to the maximum allowable rate, as long as there had been no more than mild local reactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IgG Monitoring</head><p>Serum trough levels were monitored as follows.</p><p>− Screening and Epoch 1: Week 1, 4, 7, 10 and 13 for subjects receiving treatment every 3 Weeks, and Week 1, 5, 9, and 13 for subjects receiving treatment every 4 weeks − Epochs 2 and 3: Weeks 5 and 9 − Epoch 4: Week 1, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">9,</ref><ref type="bibr">17,</ref><ref type="bibr">18,</ref><ref type="bibr">29</ref> Serum trough levels IgG &gt;5 g/L (i.e., therapeutic nadir) were to be maintained throughout the study. If levels decreased to ≤5 g/L, the subject's dose was adjusted to maintain minimum trough levels. If body weight increased &gt;5% from the weight used for the current dose, then the total dose (grams) -but not the dose per weight (g/kg) -was to be adjusted accordingly. The investigator contacted the sponsor to inform of any change to the dose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.5">Sites and Centers</head><p>Although 18 study sites were opened for the study, 3 did not enroll subjects (indicated by an asterisk in the list below). Fourteen of the active sites were in the U.S., and the remaining site was in Canada. Abnormal laboratory values that were considered an AE by the investigator were recorded on the AE Case Report Form (CRF). The justification for abnormal values not deemed AEs was recorded by the Investigator on the laboratory form. Additional tests and other evaluations required to establish the significance or etiology of an abnormal laboratory value or to monitor an AE were obtained at investigator discretion.</p><p>An electronic subject diary (eDiary) was provided to each subject at enrollment to record the following throughout the study period: occurrence of AEs, including infection; concomitant medications; days of school/work missed or days unable to perform activities of daily living, off-study out-patient visits and hospitalizations; and infusion related data (e.g. rate of infusion). Information from the eDiaries was transferred to electronic CRFs. Follow-up contact with the subject either by the diary system or by the investigator occurred 3-5 days after the completion of every infusion in each Epoch.</p><p>No data monitoring committee (DMC) was used in this study. The reasons were 1) the product to be administered subcutaneously (SC) in this study is the same as a product already licensed for this indication, although the product administered SC will be at a higher concentration 2) SC administration is known to be clinically effective 3) there is a low risk of systemic adverse reactions 4) the main anticipated adverse reactions are local reactions.</p></div>

Of note, the most common local TEAE, infusion site erythema, was reported only in Cuvitru subjects; other local TEAEs also occurred more frequently in Cuvitru subjects than in the other two cohorts. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comment</head><p>Data from <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 22</ref> appear to show that the rate of local adverse reactions was 3-fold higher using Cuvitru versus SUBCUVIA (Hizentra). These data should be interpreted with caution, however, because subjects in the Cuvitru cohort were exposed to the product for 12 months versus 3 months for SUBCUVIA. Extrapolation of the SUBCUVIA data to 12 months computes to a 50% local adverse reaction rate, i.e., less than Cuvitru. In fact, the incidence of local adverse reactions using Cuvitru (study 170903: 37.5%; study 170904: 31.1%) is the lowest of currently licensed IGSC products: Cuvitru (pooled study data): 34.4%, Hizentra: 100%, HYQVIA: 51.9% and GAMUNEX-C: 75.0% (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>).</p></div>

Due to differences in doses and /or product concentrations administered in the three studies and different analyses performed, comparison of efficacy results across studies is limited.</p><p>− In Study 170904, subjects aged 2 years and older received Cuvitru at a dose adjusted to achieve the bioavailability of GAMMAGARD LIQUID administered IV. Subjects received a weekly dose equivalent to 145% of their GAMMAGARD LIQUID IV dose in Epoch 2, which was adapted/individually adjusted for bioavailability in Epoch 3 and Epoch 4. − In Study 170903, subjects aged 2 years and older received Cuvitru at the weekly equivalent of KIOVIG (GAMMAGARD LIQUID) administered IV. The study consisted of 2 Epochs. − Study 160601, subjects aged 2 years and older received GAMMAGARD LIQUID administered SC at a dose adjusted to achieve the bioavailability of GAMMAGARD LIQUID administered IV. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 29</ref> shows that (a) most enrolled subjects were White, with minimal representation of minorities, (b) median age was higher in Study 170904 than in the other studies and (c) there was varying preponderance of male subjects in each study.

Reviewer Comment Dosing in Study 170903 was fixed at 145% of trough levels observed using GAMMAGARD LIQUID administered IV. Since doses were not adjusted or individualized as they were in Study 170904, differences in trough levels between this study and Study 170904 are not unexpected.

While the SAE was unrelated to Cuvitru, it does indicate a treatment failure.− Subjectwas a 68 year old White female with CVID who entered Epoch 2 on 17 Jan 2014 and Epoch 3 on 17 Feb 2014 (Study Day 124). On 10 Feb 2014 she underwent a chest CT which showed a right lower lobe mass. On 12 Feb 2014 she underwent a bronchoscopy which showed a malignancy consistent with adenocarcinoma of the lung/non-small cell lung cancer. On 17 Feb 2014 the diagnosis was confirmed and she began treatment soon thereafter. She withdrew from the study on 20 Mar 2014. This SAE was unrelated to the study treatment. A causal relationship between lung cancer and IGSC treatment is not biologically plausible.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Clinical Reviewer: Laurence Landow</cell></row><row><cell>STN: 125596/0</cell></row><row><cell>Reviewer comment</cell></row></table><note>− Subject was a 14 year old White female with CVID with a history of PI and arthritis who developed headache requiring hospitalization on Study Day 2 during treatment with GAMMAGARD LIQUID in Epoch 1.
