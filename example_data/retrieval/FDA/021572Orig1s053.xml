<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Preparation of CUBICIN for Administration</head><p>Reconstitution of CUBICIN Vial CUBICIN is supplied in single-dose vials, each containing 500 mg daptomycin as a sterile, lyophilized powder. The contents of a CUBICIN vial should be reconstituted, using aseptic technique, to 50 mg/mL as follows:</p><p>1. To minimize foaming, AVOID vigorous agitation or shaking of the vial during or after reconstitution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>Remove the polypropylene flip-off cap from the CUBICIN vial to expose the central portion of the rubber stopper.</p><p>3. Wipe the top of the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab or other antiseptic solution and allow to dry. After cleaning, do not touch the rubber stopper or allow it to touch any other surface.</p><p>4. Slowly transfer 10 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection through the center of the rubber stopper into the CUBICIN vial, pointing the transfer needle toward the wall of the vial. It is recommended that a beveled sterile transfer needle that is 21 gauge or smaller in diameter, or a needleless device is used, pointing the transfer needle toward the wall of the vial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.</head><p>Ensure that all of the CUBICIN powder is wetted by gently rotating the vial.</p><p>1. Allow the wetted product to stand undisturbed for 10 minutes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>Gently rotate or swirl the vial contents for a few minutes, as needed, to obtain a completely reconstituted solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Administration Instructions</head><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior to administration.</p><p>Slowly remove reconstituted liquid (50 mg daptomycin/mL) from the vial using a beveled sterile needle that is 21 gauge or smaller in diameter. Administer as an intravenous injection or infusion as described below:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intravenous Injection over a period of 2 minutes</head><p>For intravenous (IV) injection over a period of 2 minutes, administer the appropriate volume of the reconstituted CUBICIN (concentration of 50 mg/mL).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intravenous Infusion over a period of 30 minutes</head><p>For IV infusion over a period of 30 minutes, the appropriate volume of the reconstituted CUBICIN (concentration of 50 mg/mL) should be further diluted, using aseptic technique, into a 50 mL IV infusion bag containing 0.9% sodium chloride injection.</p><p>No preservative or bacteriostatic agent is present in this product. Aseptic technique must be used in the preparation of final IV solution. Do not exceed the In-Use storage conditions of the reconstituted and diluted solutions of CUBICIN described below. Discard unused portions of CUBICIN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In-Use Storage Conditions for CUBICIN Once Reconstituted in Acceptable Intravenous Diluents</head><p>Stability studies have shown that the reconstituted solution is stable in the vial for 12 hours at room temperature and up to 48 hours if stored under refrigeration at 2 to 8C (36 to 46F).</p><p>The diluted solution is stable in the infusion bag for 12 hours at room temperature and 48 hours if stored under refrigeration.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Anaphylaxis/Hypersensitivity Reactions</head><p>Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with the use of antibacterial agents, including CUBICIN, and may be life-threatening. If an allergic reaction to CUBICIN occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate therapy [see Adverse <ref type="bibr">Reactions (6.2)</ref>].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis</head><p>Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), has been reported with the use of CUBICIN. Rhabdomyolysis, with or without acute renal failure, has been reported [see Adverse <ref type="bibr">Reactions (6.2)</ref>].</p><p>Patients receiving CUBICIN should be monitored for the development of muscle pain or weakness, particularly of the distal extremities. In patients who receive CUBICIN, CPK levels should be monitored weekly, and more frequently in patients who received recent prior or concomitant therapy with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor or in whom elevations in CPK occur during treatment with CUBICIN.</p><p>In patients with renal impairment, both renal function and CPK should be monitored more frequently than once weekly [see <ref type="bibr">Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</ref>].</p><p>In Phase 1 studies and Phase 2 clinical trials, CPK elevations appeared to be more frequent when CUBICIN was dosed more than once daily. Therefore, CUBICIN should not be dosed more frequently than once a day.</p><p>CUBICIN should be discontinued in patients with unexplained signs and symptoms of myopathy in conjunction with CPK elevations to levels &gt;1,000 U/L (~5× ULN), and in patients without reported symptoms who have marked elevations in CPK, with levels &gt;2,000 U/L (≥10× ULN). In addition, consideration should be given to suspending agents associated with rhabdomyolysis, such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, temporarily in patients receiving CUBICIN [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Eosinophilic Pneumonia</head><p>Eosinophilic pneumonia has been reported in patients receiving CUBICIN [see Adverse <ref type="bibr">Reactions (6.2)</ref>]. In reported cases associated with CUBICIN, patients developed fever, dyspnea with hypoxic respiratory insufficiency, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. In general, patients developed eosinophilic pneumonia 2 to 4 weeks after starting CUBICIN and improved when CUBICIN was discontinued and steroid therapy was initiated. Recurrence of eosinophilic pneumonia upon re-exposure has been reported. Patients who develop these signs and symptoms while receiving CUBICIN should undergo prompt medical evaluation, and CUBICIN should be discontinued immediately. Treatment with systemic steroids is recommended.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Peripheral Neuropathy</head><p>Cases of peripheral neuropathy have been reported during the CUBICIN postmarketing experience [see Adverse <ref type="bibr">Reactions (6.2)</ref>]. Therefore, physicians should be alert to signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in patients receiving CUBICIN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Potential Nervous System and/or Muscular System Effects in Pediatric Patients Younger than 12 Months</head><p>Avoid use of CUBICIN in pediatric patients younger than 12 months due to the risk of potential effects on muscular, neuromuscular, and/or nervous systems (either peripheral and/or central) observed in neonatal dogs with intravenous daptomycin [see Nonclinical <ref type="bibr">Toxicology (13.2)</ref>].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6">Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea</head><p>Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with the use of nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including CUBICIN, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis [see Adverse <ref type="bibr">Reactions (6.2)</ref>]. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.</p><p>C. difficile produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, since these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7">Persisting or Relapsing S. aureus Bacteremia/Endocarditis</head><p>Patients with persisting or relapsing S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis or poor clinical response should have repeat blood cultures. If a blood culture is positive for S. aureus, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) susceptibility testing of the isolate should be performed using a standardized procedure, and diagnostic evaluation of the patient should be performed to rule out sequestered foci of infection. Appropriate surgical intervention (e.g., debridement, removal of prosthetic devices, valve replacement surgery) and/or consideration of a change in antibacterial regimen may be required.</p><p>Failure of treatment due to persisting or relapsing S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis may be due to reduced daptomycin susceptibility (as evidenced by increasing MIC of the S. aureus isolate) [see Clinical <ref type="bibr">Trials (14.2)</ref>].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.8">Decreased Efficacy in Patients with Moderate Baseline Renal Impairment</head><p>Limited data are available from the two Phase 3 complicated skin and skin structure infection (cSSSI) trials regarding clinical efficacy of CUBICIN treatment in patients with creatinine clearance (CL CR ) &lt;50 mL/min; only 31/534 (6%) patients treated with CUBICIN in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population had a baseline CL CR &lt;50 mL/min. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> shows the number of patients by renal function and treatment group who were clinical successes in the Phase 3 cSSSI trials.  <ref type="bibr">Trials (14.2)</ref>], in the CUBICIN-treated patients were lower in patients with baseline CL CR &lt;50 mL/min (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>). A decrease of the magnitude shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> was not observed in comparator-treated patients. Consider these data when selecting antibacterial therapy for use in patients with baseline moderate to severe renal impairment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.9">Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions</head><p>Clinically relevant plasma concentrations of daptomycin have been observed to cause a significant concentrationdependent false prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and elevation of International Normalized Ratio (INR) when certain recombinant thromboplastin reagents are utilized for the assay [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12.2">Pharmacodynamics</head><p>Based on animal models of infection, the antimicrobial activity of daptomycin appears to correlate with the AUC/MIC (area under the concentration-time curve/minimum inhibitory concentration) ratio for certain pathogens, including S. aureus.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12.3">Pharmacokinetics</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CUBICIN Administered over a 30-Minute Period</head><p>The mean and standard deviation (SD) pharmacokinetic parameters of daptomycin at steady-state following intravenous (IV) administration of CUBICIN over a 30-minute period at 4 to 12 mg/kg q24h to healthy young adults are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 7</ref>. Daptomycin pharmacokinetics were generally linear and time-independent at CUBICIN doses of 4 to 12 mg/kg q24h administered by IV infusion over a 30-minute period for up to 14 days. Steady-state trough concentrations were achieved by the third daily dose. The mean (SD) steady-state trough concentrations attained following the administration of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mg/kg q24h were 5.9 (1.6), 6.7 (1.6), 10.3 (5.5), 12.9 (2.9), and 13.7 (5.2) mcg/mL, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CUBICIN Administered over a 2-Minute Period</head><p>Following IV administration of CUBICIN over a 2-minute period to healthy volunteers at doses of 4 mg/kg (N=8) and 6 mg/kg (N=12), the mean (SD) steady-state systemic exposure (AUC) values were 475 (71) and 701 (82) mcg•h/mL, respectively. Values for maximum plasma concentration (C max ) at the end of the 2-minute period could not be determined adequately in this study. However, using pharmacokinetic parameters from 14 healthy volunteers who received a single dose of CUBICIN 6 mg/kg IV administered over a 30-minute period in a separate study, steady-state C max values were simulated for CUBICIN 4 and 6 mg/kg IV administered over a 2-minute period. The simulated mean (SD) steady-state C max values were 77.7 (8.1) and 116.6 (12.2) mcg/mL, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distribution</head><p>Daptomycin is reversibly bound to human plasma proteins, primarily to serum albumin, in a concentration-independent manner. The overall mean binding ranges from 90 to 93%.</p><p>In clinical studies, mean serum protein binding in subjects with creatinine clearance (CL CR ) ≥30 mL/min was comparable to that observed in healthy subjects with normal renal function. However, there was a trend toward decreasing serum protein binding among subjects with CL CR &lt;30 mL/min (88%), including those receiving hemodialysis (86%) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) (84%). The protein binding of daptomycin in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) was similar to that in healthy adult subjects.</p><p>The volume of distribution at steady-state (V ss ) of daptomycin in healthy adult subjects was approximately 0.1 L/kg and was independent of dose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metabolism</head><p>In in vitro studies, daptomycin was not metabolized by human liver microsomes.</p><p>In 5 healthy adults after infusion of radiolabeled 14 C-daptomycin, the plasma total radioactivity was similar to the concentration determined by microbiological assay. Inactive metabolites were detected in urine, as determined by the difference between total radioactive concentrations and microbiologically active concentrations. In a separate study, no metabolites were observed in plasma on Day 1 following the administration of CUBICIN at 6 mg/kg to subjects. Minor amounts of three oxidative metabolites and one unidentified compound were detected in urine. The site of metabolism has not been identified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Excretion</head><p>Daptomycin is excreted primarily by the kidneys. In a mass balance study of 5 healthy subjects using radiolabeled daptomycin, approximately 78% of the administered dose was recovered from urine based on total radioactivity (approximately 52% of the dose based on microbiologically active concentrations), and 5.7% of the administered dose was recovered from feces (collected for up to 9 days) based on total radioactivity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Renal Impairment</head><p>Population-derived pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for infected patients (complicated skin and skin structure infections [cSSSI] and S. aureus bacteremia) and noninfected subjects with various degrees of renal function <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">(Table 8)</ref>. Total plasma clearance (CL T ), elimination half-life (t 1/2 ), and volume of distribution at steady-state (V ss ) in patients with cSSSI were similar to those in patients with S. aureus bacteremia. Following administration of CUBICIN 4 mg/kg q24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean CL T was 9%, 22%, and 46% lower among subjects and patients with mild (CL CR 50-80 mL/min), moderate (CL CR 30-&lt;50 mL/min), and severe (CL CR &lt;30 mL/min) renal impairment, respectively, than in those with normal renal function (CL CR &gt;80 mL/min). The mean steady-state systemic exposure (AUC), t 1/2 , and V ss increased with decreasing renal function, although the mean AUC for patients with CL CR 30-80 mL/min was not markedly different from the mean AUC for patients with normal renal function. The mean AUC for patients with CL CR &lt;30 mL/min and for patients on dialysis (CAPD and hemodialysis dosed post-dialysis) was approximately 2 and 3 times higher, respectively, than for patients with normal renal function. The mean C max ranged from 60 to 70 mcg/mL in patients with CL CR ≥30 mL/min, while the mean C max for patients with CL CR &lt;30 mL/min ranged from 41 to 58 mcg/mL. After administration of CUBICIN 6 mg/kg q24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean C max ranged from 80 to 114 mcg/mL in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and was similar to that of patients with normal renal function. Because renal excretion is the primary route of elimination, adjustment of CUBICIN dosage interval is necessary in patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR &lt;30 mL/min) [see <ref type="bibr">Dosage and Administration (2.4)</ref>].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hepatic Impairment</head><p>The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 10 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) and compared with those in healthy volunteers (N=9) matched for gender, age, and weight.

No dosage adjustment is warranted when CUBICIN is administered to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) have not been evaluated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gender</head><p>No clinically significant gender-related differences in daptomycin pharmacokinetics have been observed. No dosage adjustment is warranted based on gender when CUBICIN is administered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Geriatric</head><p>The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 12 healthy elderly subjects (≥75 years of age) and 11 healthy young controls (18 to 30 years of age). Following administration of a single 4 mg/kg dose of CUBICIN by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean total clearance of daptomycin was approximately 35% lower and the mean AUC 0- was approximately 58% higher in elderly subjects than in healthy young subjects. There were no differences in C max [see <ref type="bibr">Use in Specific Populations (8.5)</ref>].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Obesity</head><p>The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 6 moderately obese (Body Mass Index [BMI] 25 to 39.9 kg/m 2 ) and 6 extremely obese (BMI ≥40 kg/m 2 ) subjects and controls matched for age, gender, and renal function. Following administration of CUBICIN by IV infusion over a 30-minute period as a single 4 mg/kg dose based on total body weight, the total plasma clearance of daptomycin normalized to total body weight was approximately 15% lower in moderately obese subjects and 23% lower in extremely obese subjects than in nonobese controls. The AUC 0- of daptomycin was approximately 30% higher in moderately obese subjects and 31% higher in extremely obese subjects than in nonobese controls. The differences were most likely due to differences in the renal clearance of daptomycin. No adjustment of CUBICIN dosage is warranted in obese patients.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adult Animals</head><p>In animals, daptomycin administration has been associated with effects on skeletal muscle. However, there were no changes in cardiac or smooth muscle. Skeletal muscle effects were characterized by microscopic degenerative/regenerative changes and variable elevations in creatine phosphokinase (CPK). No fibrosis or rhabdomyolysis was evident in repeat-dose studies up to the highest doses tested in rats (150 mg/kg/day) and dogs (100 mg/kg/day). The degree of skeletal myopathy showed no increase when treatment was extended from 1 month to up to 6 months. Severity was dose-dependent. All muscle effects, including microscopic changes, were fully reversible within 30 days following the cessation of dosing.</p><p>In adult animals, effects on peripheral nerve (characterized by axonal degeneration and frequently accompanied by significant losses of patellar reflex, gag reflex, and pain perception) were observed at daptomycin doses higher than those associated with skeletal myopathy. Deficits in the dogs' patellar reflexes were seen within 2 weeks after the start of treatment at 40 mg/kg/day (9 times the human C max at the 6 mg/kg/day dose), with some clinical improvement noted within 2 weeks after the cessation of dosing. However, at 75 mg/kg/day for 1 month, 7 of 8 dogs failed to regain full patellar reflex responses within a 3-month recovery period. In a separate study in dogs receiving doses of 75 and 100 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks, minimal residual histological changes were noted at 6 months after the cessation of dosing. However, recovery of peripheral nerve function was evident.</p><p>Tissue distribution studies in rats showed that daptomycin is retained in the kidney but appears to penetrate the bloodbrain barrier only minimally following single and multiple doses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Juvenile Animals</head><p>Target organs of daptomycin-related effects in 7-week-old juvenile dogs were skeletal muscle and nerve, the same target organs as in adult dogs. In juvenile dogs, nerve effects were noted at lower daptomycin blood concentrations than in adult dogs following 28 days of dosing. In contrast to adult dogs, juvenile dogs also showed evidence of effects in nerves of the spinal cord as well as peripheral nerves after 28 days of dosing. No nerve effects were noted in juvenile dogs following 14 days of dosing at doses up to 75 mg/kg/day.</p><p>Administration of daptomycin to 7-week-old juvenile dogs for 28 days at doses of 50 mg/kg/day produced minimal degenerative effects on the peripheral nerve and spinal cord in several animals, with no corresponding clinical signs. A dose of 150 mg/kg/day for 28 days produced minimal degeneration in the peripheral nerve and spinal cord as well as minimal to mild degeneration of the skeletal muscle in a majority of animals, accompanied by slight to severe muscle weakness evident in most dogs. Following a 28-day recovery phase, microscopic examination revealed recovery of the skeletal muscle and the ulnar nerve effects, but nerve degeneration in the sciatic nerve and spinal cord was still observed in all 150 mg/kg/day dogs.</p><p>Following once-daily administration of daptomycin to juvenile dogs for 28 days, microscopic effects in nerve tissue were noted at a C max value of 417 mcg/mL, which is approximately 3-fold less than the C max value associated with nerve effects in adult dogs treated once daily with daptomycin for 28 days (1308 mcg/mL).</p></div>

At a dose of 25 mg/kg/day with associated C max and AUC inf values of 147 mcg/mL and 717 mcg•h/mL, respectively (1.6 and 1.0-fold the adult human C max and AUC, respectively, at the 6 mg/kg/day dose), mild clinical signs of twitching and one incidence of muscle rigidity were observed with no corresponding effect on body weight.

Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterials, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever), even as late as 2 or more months after having received the last dose of the antibacterial. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. <ref type="bibr">[See Warnings and Precautions (5.6</ref>).]</p><p>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including CUBICIN, should be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When CUBICIN is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be administered exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by CUBICIN or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p><p>For patent information: www.merck.com/product/patent/home.html</p><p>The trademarks depicted herein are owned by their respective companies.</p><p>Copyright © 2015 Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

Echocardiography, including a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), was performed within 5 days following study enrollment. The choice of comparator agent was based on the oxacillin susceptibility of the S. aureus isolate. The duration of study treatment was based on the investigator's clinical diagnosis. Final diagnoses and outcome assessments at Test of Cure (6 weeks after the last treatment dose) were made by a treatment-blinded Adjudication Committee, using protocol-specified clinical definitions and a composite primary efficacy endpoint (clinical and microbiological success) at the Test of Cure visit.A total of 246 patients ≥18 years of age (124 CUBICIN, 122 comparator) with S. aureus bacteremia were randomized from 48 centers in the US and Europe. In the ITT population, 120 patients received CUBICIN and 115 received comparator (62 received an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin and 53 received vancomycin). Thirty-five patients treated with an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin received vancomycin initially for 1 to 3 days, pending final susceptibility results for the S. aureus isolates. The median age among the 235 patients in the ITT population was 53 years (range: 21 to 91 years); 30/120 (25%) in the CUBICIN group and 37/115 (32%) in the comparator group were ≥65 years of age. Of the 235 ITT patients, there were 141 (60%) males and 156 (66%) Caucasians across the two treatment groups. In addition, 176 (75%) of the ITT population had systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) at baseline and 85 (36%) had surgical procedures within 30 days prior to onset of the S. aureus bacteremia. Eighty-nine patients (38%) had bacteremia caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Entry diagnosis was based on the modified Duke criteria and comprised 37 (16%) Definite, 144 (61%) Possible, and 54 (23%) Not Endocarditis. Of the 37 patients with an entry diagnosis of Definite Endocarditis, all (100%) had a final diagnosis of infective endocarditis, and of the 144 patients with an entry diagnosis of Possible Endocarditis, 15 (10%) had a final diagnosis of infective endocarditis as assessed by the Adjudication Committee. Of the 54 patients with an entry diagnosis of Not Endocarditis, 1 (2%) had a final diagnosis of infective endocarditis as assessed by the Adjudication Committee.In the ITT population, there were 182 patients with bacteremia and 53 patients with infective endocarditis as assessed by the Adjudication Committee, including 35 with right-sided endocarditis and 18 with left-sided endocarditis. The 182 patients with bacteremia comprised 121 with complicated S. aureus bacteremia and 61 with uncomplicated S. aureus bacteremia.Complicated bacteremia was defined as S. aureus isolated from blood cultures obtained on at least 2 different calendar days, and/or metastatic foci of infection (deep tissue involvement), and classification of the patient as not having endocarditis according to the modified Duke criteria. Uncomplicated bacteremia was defined as S. aureus isolated from blood culture(s) obtained on a single calendar day, no metastatic foci of infection, no infection of prosthetic material, and classification of the patient as not having endocarditis according to the modified Duke criteria. The definition of right-sided infective endocarditis (RIE) used in the clinical trial was Definite or Possible Endocarditis according to the modified Duke criteria and no echocardiographic evidence of predisposing pathology or active involvement of either the mitral or aortic valve. Complicated RIE comprised patients who were not intravenous drug users, had a positive blood culture for MRSA, serum creatinine ≥2.5 mg/dL, or evidence of extrapulmonary sites of infection. Patients who were intravenous drug users, had a positive blood culture for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), had serum creatinine &lt;2.5 mg/dL, and were without evidence of extrapulmonary sites of infection were considered to have uncomplicated RIE.The coprimary efficacy endpoints in the trial were the Adjudication Committee success rates at the Test of Cure visit (6 weeks after the last treatment dose) in the ITT and Per Protocol (PP) populations. The overall Adjudication Committee success rates in the ITT population were 44.2% (53/120) in patients treated with CUBICIN and 41.7% (48/115) in patients treated with comparator (difference = 2.4% [95% CI −10.2, 15.1]). The success rates in the PP population were 54.4% (43/79) in patients treated with CUBICIN and 53.3% (32/60) in patients treated with comparator (difference = 1.1% [95% CI −15.6, 17.8]).</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>
