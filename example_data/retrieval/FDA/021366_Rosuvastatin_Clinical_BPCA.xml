<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Risk Benefit Assessment</head><p>The benefits of rosuvastatin outweigh its risks in this pediatric population with HeFH.</p><p>Risks associated with rosuvastatin There were no deaths and no cases of rhabdomyolysis in this trial. The most common muscle related adverse events (AEs) observed with rosuvastatin therapy were muscle aches, followed by myopathy, muscle cramps and spasms, and musculoskeletal pain. During the double-blind phase, elevated serum creatine phosphokinase (CK) greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (&gt; 10 x ULN) was observed more frequently in the rosuvastatin-treated groups compared to the placebo-treated subjects. Four of 130 (3%) children treated with rosuvastatin (2 treated with 10 mg and 2 treated with 20 mg) had increased CK &gt; 10 x ULN, compared to 0 of 46 children on placebo. Most of the CK elevations normalized by the end of the trial while the subjects were still on study drug. None of the subjects with muscle-related events prematurely discontinued from the trial.</p><p>None of the subjects met the criteria for Hy's Law 1 , or had any hepatic adverse events. While there were elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) during the trial, most occurred during the double-blind phase, and were &lt;3 x ULN. Three AST elevations exceeded 3 x ULN, along with increased CK&gt; 10 x ULN, and all 3 subjects were in the rosuvastatin groups. In 2 of these 3 cases, the source of the AST elevations was more likely muscle given the less pronounced increase in ALT, as well as the CK elevation. The third subject's AST and ALT were both elevated about 3 x ULN, which may indicate liver and muscle involvement.</p><p>Urine protein: creatinine ratios were measured in this trial, given the concern for proteinuria observed in the approval trials in adults at 80 mg doses of rosuvastatin <ref type="bibr">(FDA 2003)</ref>. In the PLUTO trial, 4 pediatric subjects (2.3%) had increased protein: creatinine ratios &gt;0.2. Four subjects had increases in serum creatinine &gt;25% from baseline on 2 or more visits, 1 subject 1 Hy's Law: The drug shown by more frequent of aminotransferases (ATs) increases 3 x ULN than the (non hepatotoxic) control. Some subjects with ATs&gt; 3 x ULN also show elevation of serum total bilirubin (TBL)&gt; 2 x ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (serum alkaline phosphatase [ALP] activity &gt;2 x ULN). No other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased AT and total bilirubin, such as viral hepatitis A, B, or C, preexisting or acute liver disease, or another drug capable of causing the observed injury. while on 5 mg rosuvastatin, 2 subjects while on 20 mg, and 1 subject while on 10 mg and then 20 mg. However, the increased serum creatinine remained within normal limits despite the &gt;25% increase.</p><p>Risk compared to other statins Generally, the risks associated with rosuvastatin are comparable to other statins. Statins have been associated with myopathy and rarely, rhabdomyolysis. They also modestly increase hepatic aminotransferases, but rarely lead to severe hepatic injury, hepatitis or liver failure. These increases often resolve with continued statin therapy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefits of rosuvastatin</head><p>In the Pediatric Lipid Reduction Trial with Rosuvastatin (PLUTO), subjects with HeFH, treated with 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg rosuvastatin had reductions in low density lipoprotein (LDL-C) of approximately 38%, 44%, 50%, respectively, compared to placebo. Atorvastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, and pravastatin have also demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of children and adolescents with HeFH. The highest approved doses were tested in clinical trials and resulted in mean LDL-C reductions of 41% for simvastatin <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(de Jongh and Ose et al. 2002)</ref>, 40% for atorvastatin <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(McCrindle and Ose et al 2003)</ref>, 34% for fluvastatin (van der <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Graaf and Mierman et al 2006)</ref>, 27% for lovastatin <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Stein and Illingworth 1999)</ref>, and 24% for pravastatin <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Weigman and Hutten et al. 2004</ref>).While the LDL-C reductions with atorvastatin, simvastatin and fluvastatin appear to be comparable to rosuvastatin, the subjects were treated with the highest approved doses of those other statins to reach goal.</p><p>Risk: benefit of rosuvastatin The risks and benefits of rosuvastatin are comparable to other statins, and its availability would provide another option in the armamentarium of drugs already available for treating HeFH. The balance of risk to benefit is acceptable.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Product Information</head><p>CRESTOR (rosuvastatin calcium) is a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMG Co-A) reductase inhibitor. It is a synthetic lipid-lowering agent for oral administration. Rosuvastatin is available in tablet form containing 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg and 40 mg of the active ingredient, rosuvastatin calcium. The excipients are: microcrystalline cellulose NF, lactose monohydrate NF, tribasic calcium phosphate NF, crospovidone NF, magnesium stearate NF, hypromellose NF, triacetin NF, titanium dioxide USP, yellow ferric oxide, and red ferric oxide NF.</p><p>The clinical formulations of rosuvastatin tablets used in this pediatric trial (4522IL/0086) were the same as those used in the adult rosuvastatin studies. The major safety concern for statins as a class is muscle toxicity with the most serious complication being rhabdomyolysis. Since its approval there have been several key labeling changes due to postmarketing experience <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">(Table 2)</ref>. To the paragraph that begins with "Consequently" the following changes and renumbered were made: 1. "inadequately treated" was inserted before the word "hypothyroidism." Additionally, a new item number 3 was inserted in the list to read: 3. The 40 mg dose of rosuvastatin is reserved only for those patients who have not achieved their LDL-C goal utilizing the 20 mg dose of rosuvastatin once daily (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). 6. "dehydration" was added after the word "hypotension" to the list of examples.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HOW SUPPLIED</head><p>The section has been changed to reflect debossing changes made to the 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg tablets. The debossing now consists of the word "CRESTOR" and the mg strength of the tablet on one side of the tablet; the other side of the tablet is blank</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Important Safety Issues With Consideration to Related Drugs</head><p>Statins have been associated with elevated liver transaminases. Asymptomatic elevated liver transaminase &gt;3 x ULN occur in &lt;1% of patients on low and intermediate doses of statins and 2 to 3% at high doses (McKenney and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Davidson et al. 2006)</ref>. The mechanism of action of the statin mediated liver enzyme elevation has not been elucidated; however, modest elevations do not appear to signal risk for significant liver injury, even with continued statin treatment. Statins have also been associated with muscle aches, pain, weakness and rarely, rhabdomyolysis. In 21 clinical trials, with 180,000 person-years follow-up in statin or placebo treated subjects, myopathy (muscle symptoms with CK&gt; 10 x ULN) occurred in 5 subjects per 100,000 personyears and rhabdomyolysis in 1.6 subjects per 100,000 person-years (placebo-corrected) (McKenney and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Davidson et al. 2006)</ref>. During clinical trials with rosuvastatin, 1.0% and 0.4% of the subjects treated with 80mg/day developed myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, respectively, so the 80mg/day dose was not approved.</p><p>As mentioned in the previous section, proteinuria was detected in 12% of the subjects treated with 80mg/day of rosuvastatin (this dose was subsequently not approved) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Jones and Davidson et al. 2003)</ref>. The frequency of proteinuria with lower doses of rosuvastatin (5-40 mg), atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin was the same as placebo <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Jones and Davidson et al 2003)</ref>. Proteinuria may occur with all statins, but may be more likely with more potent statins <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bays 2006)</ref>. In 2005 the Agency concluded that proteinuria in subjects on statin therapy was not associated with renal impairment or renal failure (FDA 2009b).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Summary of Presubmission Regulatory Activity Related to Submission</head><p>April 26, 2001 AstraZeneca requests issuance of a FDA Written Request (WR) for a pediatric study for rosuvastatin to obtain pediatric exclusivity. AstraZeneca also requests a waiver for the pediatric population of less than 10 years of age for all indications and a 2 year deferral for ages 10 -17 years. <ref type="bibr">(IND 56,</ref><ref type="bibr">385;</ref><ref type="bibr">Serial No. 206;</ref><ref type="bibr">Serial No.</ref> changed from 206 to 205 per FDA).</p><p>June 1, 2001 FDA grants a waiver for pediatric studies for children less than 10 years old and a two-year deferral for pediatric subjects aged 10 to 17 years for rosuvastatin calcium for hypercholesterolemia. However, at this time the FDA denies the issuance of pediatric WR for rosuvastatin until after the New Drug Application (NDA) approval and the availability of additional information on the safety and efficacy of rosuvastatin calcium in adults.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>September 17, 2001</head><p>AstraZeneca requests FDA to reconsider the decision not to issue a WR for pediatric studies on rosuvastatin calcium. <ref type="bibr">(IND 56,</ref><ref type="bibr">385;</ref><ref type="bibr">Serial No.</ref>  FDA provides official minutes to AstraZeneca for the teleconference held on 3 May 2004 to discuss the pediatric study design. The Agency recommends that AstraZeneca not submit a PPSR until the Citizen Petition is resolved. The FDA recommends the following study design: Enroll 150 -200 pts, &gt; 100 evaluable subjects on rosuvastatin at 1 year. The trial should be divided into two phases:</p><p>1. Short term efficacy phase -6-week parallel group, placebo controlled, double-blind study at rosuvastatin doses of 5, 10, 20 mg 2. Long term efficacy and safety phase (treatment to goal) -Re-randomization into a 42</p><p>week double-blind, study to compare rosuvastatin (5, 10, 20 mg) to an active control (atorvastatin 10 and 20 mg) in a 2:1 ratio. The effect of rosuvastatin therapy on protein excretion in the pediatric population should be part of the PPSR. Such a study would require sensitive measurement of baseline and follow-up urine protein excretion, either using 24-hour urine collections or multiple timed overnight urine collections. These measurements should be performed in all treatment groups, including placebo, during the double-blind treatment period.</p><p>• Include a 3-month double-blind treatment period that can be followed by an open-label extension period wherein all subjects will be treated to LDL-C goals with rosuvastatin calcium.</p><p>• Submit information to support feasibility of such a study taking into account the total number of subjects per treatment group and the individual variability in urine protein excretion in this subject population.  <ref type="bibr">(IND 56,</ref><ref type="bibr">385;</ref><ref type="bibr">Serial No. 0568)</ref> regarding deferral of pediatric studies in subjects 10 to 17 years of age for CRESTOR® until 31 December 2009. The deferred pediatric studies required under Section 2 of PREA are considered required postmarketing study commitments and was inadvertently omitted from the 23 February 2006 letter informing AstraZeneca all of post-marketing studies acknowledged in the 12 August 2003 NDA approval letter had been completed. At the time of the 2003 NDA approval, commitment to produce a rosuvastatin sNDA for a pediatric indication was not placed in the approval letter because FDA's Pediatric Rule was under review in the US court system. On October 17, 2002, the court ruled that FDA did not have the authority to issue a Pediatric Rule and had barred FDA from enforcing it. The status of this pediatric post-marketing study shall be reported annually according to 21 CFR314.81 and the commitment would be listed as: October 12, 2006 AstraZeneca and FDA teleconference to discuss PLUTO, specifically, the exclusion criterion: "Boys and girls with height &lt; 3rd percentile for age and sex or height-weight ratio &gt;97th percentile for age and sex should also be excluded" and the inclusion criterion: "children with LDL-C &gt;160 mg/dl would be eligible if they have 2 or more of several listed CV risk factors, including severe obesity". FDA agrees that the WR was inconsistent and confusing. The FDA does not want to exclude obese children from PLUTO. Therefore, the exclusion criterion for height-weight ratio &gt;97th percentile can/should be deleted. AstraZeneca will clarify the inconsistency with a protocol amendment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>January 25, 2007</head><p>AstraZeneca submits a Protocol Amendment <ref type="bibr">(IND 56,</ref><ref type="bibr">385;</ref><ref type="bibr">Serial No. 0593)</ref> for PLUTO which provides for the following changes: The Agency agrees that PLUTO as a single pivotal study is sufficient for filing and indication related to the effects of rosuvastatin in pediatric subjects • CRFs for any subjects who died, experienced an SAE, discontinued treatment due to an AE or withdrew consent should be provided • Subject narratives on all SAEs, regardless of determination of drug relation, and AEs of special interest, including but not limited to: muscle events, proteinuria, and hepatic events should be submitted.</p><p>• The submission appears to meet the requirements to reach a regulatory decision regarding approval for pediatric efficacy indication and 6 months patent exclusivity but this is a review issue.</p></div>

The nonclinical data for rosuvastatin were reviewed for the 2003 approval of NDA 21-366. The non-clinical safety findings relevant to clinical use were:</p><p>Liver toxicity with rosuvastatin exposure was observed across animal species in studies with 1 to 7 x the human exposure based on the human dose of 80 mg/day, 2 to 16 x human exposure based on the human dose of 40 mg/day, 5 to 35 x human exposure based on the human dose of 20 mg/day, and 11 to 78 x human exposure based on the human dose of 10 mg/day. Liver toxicity appeared to be reversible.</p><p>Muscle toxicity was observed in pregnant rabbits at lethal rosuvastatin doses (≥ 3 mg/kg). It was estimated that 5 mg/kg in male rabbits and 3 mg/kg in female rabbits was 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 x human exposure at human doses of 80, 40, 20, and 10 mg/day, respectively.</p><p>Renal toxicity was observed in rats and dogs at exposures 39 to 46 x human exposure at 80 mg/day, in monkeys at exposure levels comparable to human exposure at 80 mg/day, and in pregnant rabbits at the lethal dose. Testicular giant cell formation was observed in dogs at 46 x human exposure at human dose of 80 mg/day after one month treatment. Vacuolation of seminiferous tubular epithelium was observed in monkeys after six months treatment at about 2, 4, 8, and 18 x human exposure at human doses of 80, 40, 20, and 10 mg/day, respectively. In an oral 104-week carcinogenicity study in rats, the incidence of uterine stromal polyps was significantly increased in females at 11, 23, 53, and 116 x human exposure at human doses of 80, 40, 20, and 10 mg/day, respectively. In a 107-week carcinogenicity study in mice, incidence of hepatocellular adenoma/carcinoma was observed at 10, 21, 48, and 107 x human exposure at human doses of 80, 40, 20, and 10 mg/day, respectively). </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.1">Mechanism of Action</head><p>Rosuvastatin selectively and competitively inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol. Rosuvastatin has been shown to have high uptake and selectivity in the liver, the target organ for cholesterol lowering. Rosuvastatin produces its lipid-modifying effects in two ways: it increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell-surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL, and it inhibits hepatic synthesis of VLDL, which reduces the total number of VLDL and LDL particles.</p></div>

After single administrations of rosuvastatin from 10 to 40 to 80 mg in children and adolescents with HeFH, systemic exposure increased with rosuvastatin dose. Subjects who received multiple doses of rosuvastatin 80 mg had a maximum concentration (C max ) and area under the curve from time zero to 24 hours (AUC (0-24) ) of approximately 19% and 49% greater than the corresponding values after single-dose administrations. There were no important timedependent changes observed between the pharmacokinetics on Day 7 and Day 1. Rosuvastatin was well tolerated in doses up to 80 mg for up to 7 days in this subject population.</p><p>The pharmacokinetic profile in the pediatric population was similar to the pharmacokinetic profile in the adult population. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Summary</head><p>The PLUTO trial demonstrated the effectiveness of rosuvastatin to treat pediatric subjects aged 10 to 17 years with HeFH.</p><p>The population studied in this trial reflected the general distribution of HeFH in the population, and the doses selected were appropriate for the efficacy assessments. The 12-week double-blind period was adequate to show efficacy as the full effect of rosuvastatin treatment has been measured at 6 weeks in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Marais and Raal et al. 2008</ref>). In the 40-week open-label phase, the doses (5 mg to 20 mg) were adjusted at specified intervals as tolerated during the course of the trial to obtain additional efficacy and safety assessments.</p><p>One hundred seventy six randomized subjects were treated with placebo, rosuvastatin 5 mg, 10 mg or 20 mg for 12 weeks, before entering a 40-week open-label phase where all subjects were treated with rosuvastatin and titrated to meet the LDL-C goal &lt; 110 mg/dL. Ninety-three percent of the 176 randomized subjects completed the double-blind phase, with statistically significant lowering of LDL-C, total cholesterol (total-C), non-HDL-C and ApoB for each dose of rosuvastatin compared to placebo. The percent LDL-C change ranged from -38% to -50% ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 2</ref>). About 41% of patients on doses of 10 mg and 20 mg achieved an LDL-C less than 110 mg/dL after 12 weeks of therapy, which was maintained through the open-label phase. During the open-label phase, 71% of the patients were titrated to 20 mg in an attempt to lower LDL-C below 110 mg/dL.  </p></div>

During this phase, all subjects received rosuvastatin. The starting open-label dose of rosuvastatin was based on whether the randomized dose achieved the LDL-C goal of &lt;110 mg/dL at the end of the double-blind phase. Subjects randomized to rosuvastatin 10 mg or 20 mg who had not reached the LDL-C goal at Week 12 were continued on that dose at the start of the open-label phase. All other subjects (including those in the placebo group), started the open-label on 5 mg rosuvastatin. During the open-label phase, the rosuvastatin dose could be up-titrated at 6-week intervals to the next highest dose (maximum daily dose of 20 mg) to achieve the LDL-C target goal of &lt;110 mg/dL.</p></div>

One hundred seventy seven subjects entered the double-blind phase. One subject completed the 12-week, double-blind treatment phase but chose not to continue in the trial.

Only 1 subject was excluded from the randomized group to create the ITT analysis set <ref type="table" target="#tab_26">(Table 6</ref>).</p><p>Per protocol (PP) analysis set: The PP analysis set was a subset of the ITT analysis set and excluded data from patients with major protocol violations or deviations that would likely affect the efficacy outcomes. Major protocol violations included not meeting inclusion criteria numberone in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>, as well as a fasting TG ≥250 mg/dL at Visit 2, uncontrolled hypothyroidism at Visit 1, and the use of specified disallowed concomitant medications during the dietary lead-in period. A major violation excluded the subject's data from the PP analysis set.</p><p>A major deviation excluded the subject's data from the time when the deviation occurred. Major deviations included non-compliance with study treatment, misrandomizations, misallocations, concomitant therapy, thyroid replacement therapy and unblinding.

The most frequently reported treatment emergent adverse events were headache and nasopharyngitis (incidence ≥ 1.0%), and the majority of the AEs were mild to moderate in intensity (Section 7.4.1). There were 3 serious adverse events (SAEs): 1 subject experienced blurred vision while on placebo and another had appendicitis while on 10 mg. The third subject developed a vesicular skin eruption on 20 mg rosuvastatin and was discontinued from the trial (Section 7.3.2). Six subjects experienced AEs that led to discontinuation (DAEs) from the trial; 2 subjects developed nausea and 1 subject had menorrhagia while on 5 mg rosuvastatin, 1 subject developed fatigue while on 10 mg, 1 subject developed vesicular skin eruption on 20 mg, and 1 subject developed blurred vision while on placebo (Section 7.3.3). The latter 2 subjects were also classified as having SAEs.</p><p>During the 12-week double-blind phase, 74 subjects (56.9%) experienced an adverse event while on rosuvastatin: 23 (54.7%) were on 5 mg rosuvastatin, 27 (61.4%) on 10 mg and 24 (54.5%) on 20 mg. This was similar to the placebo group (27 [58.7%]). Two subjects (1.5%) had SAEs during this phase, one subject while on 5 mg rosuvastatin, and the other while on 10 mg. Only 1 (0.8%) subject had a DAE, which occurred while on 5 mg <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">(Table 17)</ref>.</p><p>During the 40-week open-label phase, 130 subjects (75.1%) experienced AEs: 53 (41.1%) were treated with 5 mg rosuvastatin, 59 (48.0%) with 10 mg and 82 (66.7%) with 20 mg. There appeared to be an upward trend in the number of subjects with AEs with increasing rosuvastatin dose. Although there were 2 (1.2%) subjects with SAEs during the open-label phase of the trial, 1 of these subjects was up-titrated from 10 mg to 20 mg while the event was ongoing, so is counted twice in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 17</ref> (once under 10 mg and once under 20 mg). Four (2.3%) subjects had DAEs, 3 of the DAEs occurred while on 5 mg and 1 DAE occurred while on 20 mg rosuvastatin <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">(Table 17)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Musculoskeletal</head><p>The most common muscle related AEs were muscle aches, followed by myopathy 5 , muscle cramps and spasms, and musculoskeletal pain. Compared with placebo, treatment with rosuvastatin was associated with increased incidence rates of CK elevations and reports of myalgia.</p><p>During the double-blind phase, there were 4 subjects with increased CK&gt;10 x ULN.

Subjects treated with rosuvastatin (7 [5.4%]) also demonstrated more frequent increases in AST than subjects treated with placebo (0), but none of the elevations &gt;3 x ULN occurred on 2 consecutive visits (Section 7.4.2). While there were elevations in AST and ALT during the trial, most were &lt;3 x ULN, there were 3 AST elevations (all in rosuvastatin-treated subjects) that exceeded 3 x ULN. In 2 of these 3 cases, the source of the AST elevations was more likely muscle given the less pronounced increase in ALT, as well as the CK elevation. The third subject's AST and ALT were both elevated about 3 x ULN, which may indicate liver and muscle involvement (Section 7.4.2).</p></div>

It could be assumed that the rosuvastatin-treated subjects with the CK elevations had the same levels of exercise as those randomized to placebo, as well as those who did not have substantial elevations in CK. Since exercise data were not collected on all subjects it is not possible to accurately say whether CK elevations in the rosuvastatin-treated subjects were due in whole or part to exercise. Pooling data across studies to estimate and compare the incidence of adverse events was not relevant to this submission as there was only one trial.</p></div>

The duration for each dose varied due to the titration to goal design of this phase. The mean duration was 93 days on 5 mg, 86 days on 10 mg, and 190 days on 20 mg. The mean duration of exposure to each treatment dose was adequate for the safety evaluation during both the double-blind and open-label treatment periods in this trial. For the randomized period, duration of treatment was calculated from the date of the first dose to the date of the last dose of study medication. During the open-label phase, a subject may have titrated to different doses. For each subject, the exposure to each dose was calculated by adding the number of days on each dose. Gaps of non-compliance in between these days were ignored. For those subjects who did not return bottles on the last visit, it was assumed that they took medication. For those subjects who are lost to follow-up, it was assumed that they took medication up until last day of contact. NA Not applicable; SD Standard deviation When analyzed by the demographic characteristics sex, ages, and race, the mean durations were similar among the sex and age subgroups <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">(Table 19</ref>).

Subjects receiving the 80 mg dose then received rosuvastatin 80 mg once daily for 7 days after a 4 to 10 day wash-out period; serial blood samples and a 24-hour urine specimen were obtained on Day 7. Blood specimens were also collected to determine the plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin and N-desmethyl rosuvastatin at predose and after the first dose of trial treatment.</p><p>Compared to the subjects receiving a single dose of 80 mg rosuvastatin, the subjects receiving multiple doses had 19% and 49% higher Cmax and AUC (0-24) respectively. Pre-dose and 24-hour trough concentrations of rosuvastatin in plasma were comparable by inspection, suggesting that steady state was achieved by Day 7. The accumulation ratio of rosuvastatin was 1.5. No important time-dependent changes were observed when comparing the pharmacokinetics on Day 7 with Day 1. The apparent oral clearance of rosuvastatin appeared independent of dose.</p><p>The maximum geometric mean (gmean) renal excretion of rosuvastatin at any dose level was 5.5%. The exposure to N-desmethyl rosuvastatin, a metabolite of rosuvastatin, did not appear to increase with multiple administrations of rosuvastatin; mean first-dose and steady-state values of Cmax were 8.0 and 6.5 ng/mL, AUC(0-t) values were 45.4 and 45.7 ng.h/mL. The metabolite was rapidly formed and plasma concentrations quickly fell below the limit of quantification; it was not possible to determine t1/2 or renal clearance of the metabolite.</p><p>Time-dependent changes in pharmacokinetics were similar on Day 7 and Day 1.

Statin-associated myopathy is related to statin dose, and often due to drug/drug interactions that increase statin concentration. The most serious muscle toxicity is rhabdomyolysis, in which skeletal muscle cells break down releasing myoglobin, enzymes and electrolytes from the muscle cells. This process may lead to renal failure, as myoglobin is reno-toxic. Rhabdomyolysis occurs at a rate of approximately 1/100,000 patient-years in statin-treated patients.</p><p>Rosuvastatin is approved for use in adults up to 40 mg/day. During the pre-approval clinical trials, 1.0% and 0.4% of the subjects treated with 80 mg/day developed myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, respectively, and therefore, the 80 mg/day dose was not approved <ref type="bibr">(FDA 2003)</ref>.</p><p>In the preapproval clinical trials, proteinuria was detected in 12% of the subjects treated with 80 mg/day of rosuvastatin. In the STELLAR 7 trial, 2 subjects on that same dose experienced acute renal failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Jones and Davidson et al. 2003)</ref>. However, these 2 subjects had pre-existing conditions that may have increased their risk for renal failure. Rosuvastatin was the first statin to be associated with the development and progression of proteinuria and hematuria in clinical trials. The effect was most pronounced at the 80 mg dose but was also evident at 40 mg. Proteinuria, with or without hematuria, was associated with increased serum creatinine in these subjects.</p><p>Proteinuria was also observed in clinical trials in patients treated with atorvastatin 10-80 mg/day, simvastatin 20-80 mg/day, and pravastatin 20-40 mg/day. However, it was not associated with decreasing renal function, and was reversible with or without dose reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Davidson 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Other clinically relevant adverse effects associated with statin therapy include liver transaminase elevation, which is usually mild and self-limiting.</p><p>Drug specific safety concerns evaluated, include: </p></div>

Narratives for these subjects are also provided below. The narratives of the 3 subjects with non-fatal SAEs:</p><p>Subject E0061028 was a 14-year-old Caucasian male (randomized to placebo) with a past medical history of left eye loss due to trauma. This subject had blurred vision in the right eye on Day 1 of the first placebo dose.

The subject was up-titrated to 20 mg the day the adverse event was resolved. The patient remained in the trial.</p><p>Subject E0044002 was a 17-year-old Caucasian male (randomized to rosuvastatin 20 mg) with a history of low iron and facial acne, on concomitant therapy with multivitamins with iron and minocycline (discontinued Day 175). On Day 175, the subject developed a vesicular rash that progressed to cellulitis. The subject was hospitalized for intravenous antibiotic treatment. A biopsy showed superficial and deep perivascular dermatitis with interstitial component composed of eosinophils, irregular psoriasiform hyperplasia, and acantholysis and intraepidermal vesicles. The rash resolved 5 days after the discontinuation of rosuvastatin. Reviewer comment: The vesicular rash that developed while on rosuvastatin has the histologic pattern of an inflammatory process. Cutaneous reactions to medications can produce a wide range of clinical and histologic patterns. The differential diagnosis includes but is not limited to erythema multiforme, urticaria, lichenoid drug eruption and viral exanthemata. The AE warnings in some of the statin labels include skin findings ranging from urticaria to bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chaffins and Cockerell 1996)</ref>.

CK decreased to 142 in 14 days while off rosuvastatin. The subject had a normal serum creatinine during the trial; however, the subject's protein creatinine ratio was elevated &gt; 0.2 at the end of the trial, and was followed for an additional 120 days (to Day 400) until it returned to normal (&lt;0.13). The GFR increased with the CK increase &gt;110 x ULN at Visit 6, but overall, it decreased from 111 U/L (Visit 3) at baseline to 99 U/L at the end of the trial. Urinary blood and myoglobin were negative. A supplementary muscle narrative worksheet indicated that the subject participated in one day of strong muscle training on Day 83. The study drug was temporarily stopped on Day 86 and resumed on Day 100 when the CK returned to normal limits. The subject completed the study as planned. The table below shows the patient's clinical labs over time <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">(Table 25</ref>).  Reviewer comment: The subject's peak CK elevation occurred towards the end of the double-blind phase, but was again elevated during the latter half of the open-label phase. The protein: creatinine ratio was elevated at the end of the double-blind phase and continued for 120 days after the completion of the trial. The subject's serum creatinine did not increase greater than 25% from baseline, and it remained within normal limits throughout the trial.

In any study, an investigator cannot fully know all the confounding factors. The process of randomization helps to balance potential confounders among treatment groups. In this trial it could be assumed that the rosuvastatin treated subjects with the CK elevations had the same levels of exercise as those randomized to placebo, as well as those who did not have substantial elevations in CK. Since exercise data were not collected on the other subjects it is difficult to say whether the CK elevations can be attributed all or in part to exercise. However, a synergistic interaction between exercise and rosuvastatin cannot be ruled out.

This subject was discussed in detail under musculoskeletal events.</p><p>During the open-label phase, 1 subject (E00006012) had an ALT increased above the upper limit of normal and 1 subject (E0025002) had an AE termed "liver test abnormal" <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">(Table 32)</ref>. No subject met the criteria for Hy's law and there were no cases of overt hepatic injury (e.g., jaundice).  During the double-blind phase, 1 subject (2.3%) on 10 mg rosuvastatin and 2 subjects (4.6%) on 20 mg rosuvastatin had increased AST&gt;3 x ULN on 2 consecutive visits, or at least 48 hours apart.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ALT</head><p>During 12-weeks of double-blind treatment there were 2 subjects (4.8%) on rosuvastatin 5 mg, 2 subjects (4.5%) on 10 mg, 4 subjects (9.1%) on 20 mg, and 5 subjects (10.9%) on placebo that had ALT values above the reference range. There was no apparent difference in the incidence of abnormal ALTs among the treatment groups. No subject in any treatment group experienced ALT elevations &gt;3 x ULN during the double-blind period <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">(Table 33</ref>). Only 1 subject (0.8%) had an ALT &gt;3 x ULN during the open-label phase while on 5 mg rosuvastatin and it was classified "liver function test abnormal".</p><p>Subject 25002 was a 17-year-old Caucasian male (randomized to 10 mg rosuvastatin), who experienced elevated AST and ALT on Day 128 to Day 365 of the trial. The subject also experienced myalgia on Day 36 to Day 71; however, there was no increase in CK or any other labs indicative of muscle damage during that period. All other labs were within normal limits. The subject had a dental procedure which was treated with ibuprofen from Day 128 to Day 134. No action was taken and the subject completed the trial. Reviewer comment: ALT is more specific for hepatocellular injury than AST, and this subject had a greater degree of elevation in ALT that AST. Also, the subject had these elevations in liver transaminases after down-titration to 5 mg from 10 mg rosuvastatin. While this may weaken the association between rosuvastatin exposure and the transaminase increases, the study drug may still have played a role. The subject also experienced several AEs during the trial including: headache, myalgia, influenza, nasopharyngitis and had a medical history of acute hepatitis in 2001. The mean change in ALT values from baseline to the end of the double-blind treatment period (Week 12) was higher in the rosuvastatin groups (3.3 U/L, 5.2 U/L, and 4.9 U/L for the 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg groups, respectively) than in the placebo group (0.9 U/L). The mean change from baseline to the end of the open-label treatment period (Week 52) was 4.6 U/L for all the rosuvastatin groups, similar to that seen in rosuvastatin-treated subjects at Week 12.</p><p>AST During the double-blind phase, 1 subject (2.5%) on 5 mg rosuvastatin, 3 subjects (6.8%) on 10 mg, 3 subjects (6.8%) on 20 mg, and no placebo-treated subjects had AST values above the reference range <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">(Table 33</ref>). Three subjects (E0041001, E0061004, and E0081002) treated with rosuvastatin 10 mg, 20 mg, and 20 mg, respectively, experienced elevated AST &gt;3 x ULN, as well as increased CK&gt; 10 x ULN. The ALT for subject E0081002 was also elevated approximately 3 x ULN. Subject E0061004, who also experienced an AE of myopathy, is discussed in <ref type="bibr">Section 7.3.4.

They also had negative baseline (Visit 3) dipstick urine protein and normal serum creatinine and GFR and urinary protein: creatinine ratios.</p><p>During the double-blind phase, 1 subject had an AE (urinary tract infection) related to the renal system, while on 5 mg rosuvastatin.</p><p>During the open-label phase, 7 subjects had AEs related to the renal system. Subject E0025003 had cystitis 4-times while on 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg rosuvastatin, and developed dysuria while on 20 mg, so this subject is counted more that once; 2 other subjects had cystitis while on 10 mg and 20 mg rosuvastatin. Three subjects (1.7%) had multiple episodes of urinary tract infections while on 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg rosuvastatin and 1 subject had chromaturia while on 5 mg rosuvastatin.

Subject E0026009 was previously discussed under the musculoskeletal events. This subject had CK elevated &gt;5 x ULN, however, the protein: creatinine ratio remained within normal limits during the double-blind phase.

The serum creatinine returned to baseline by the next visit. All other labs, including protein: creatinine ratio, GFR, liver transaminases and CK were within normal limits. The subject experienced one AE during the trial: dental pain due to complications with orthodontics.</p><p>Subjects with serum creatinine elevated &gt;25% from baseline, on 2 or more visits:</p><p>Subject E0041004 was a 14-year-old Caucasian male (randomized to 5 mg rosuvastatin) who was treated with cholestyramine prior to starting the trial.

These labs were all normal at the end of the trial. All other labs, including BUN, liver transaminase and CK remained within normal limits. No action was taken and the subject completed the trial.  Reviewer comment: In the absence of other explanatory factors, rosuvastatin may have played a role in the changes in the renal function. The relationship may have been clearer had more frequent protein: creatinine ratios and GFRs been measured to determine if there was a clearer pattern of renal function decline.</p><p>Subject E0041022 was a 14-year-old Caucasian male (randomized to 20 mg rosuvastatin) whose serum creatinine increased &gt;25% during both phases of the trial (but remained within normal limits). During the double-blind phase, the serum creatinine increased by 34% above baseline, then decreased once the subject entered the open-label phase on 5 mg rosuvastatin. The serum creatinine again increased &gt;25% above baseline after the subject had been up-titrated to 20 mg, but decreased by the end of the trial. All other labs, including BUN, liver transaminases and CK remained within normal limits. The only adverse event reported for this subject was influenza during the open-label phase, which was symptomatically treated with ibuprofen.

Only a small proportion exceeded 3 x ULN and none of the subjects met the criteria for Hy's Law.</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Blood Pressure</head><p>In general, a few subjects had isolated elevations in systolic blood pressure (BP) above the 90 th percentile, which normalized on subsequent visits. One subject (E0021008) had elevated systolic blood pressure &gt; 95 th percentile on 3 visits while on 20 mg rosuvastatin during the open-label phase. Another subject who had been randomized to placebo had blood pressure values that started to increase from the beginning of the trial to the end. Seven (3.9%) subjects had systolic BPs mostly elevated above the 90 th percentile for age from pre-randomization to the end of the trial. Of these 7 subjects, 1 subject was randomized to placebo, and then up-titrated from 5 mg to 20 mg during the open-label phase; 3 subjects were randomized to 5 mg, 2 of which were uptitrated from 5 mg to 20 mg rosuvastatin during the open-label phase, and the third was uptitrated from 5 mg to 10 mg rosuvastatin; 2 subjects were randomized to 10 mg rosuvastatin, 1 of which was up-titrated form 5 mg to 10 mg and the other up-titrated form 10 mg to 20 mg during the open-label phase; and one subject was randomized to 20 mg rosuvastatin and remained on that does for the rest of the trial.</p><p>Reviewer comment: The systolic BPs for those 7 subjects were elevated at baseline prior to rosuvastatin exposure. Some of these subjects had heath conditions requiring sub-chronic and chronic therapy with medications that may contribute to the systolic BP elevations (e.g., albuterol, cetirizine and ibuprofen). There were other subjects treated with these drugs that had normal blood pressures throughout the trial.</p><p>The changes in vital signs were relatively small during the double-blind phase. On average, the mean change in systolic and diastolic BP from the start of the randomized phase of the trial (Week 0) to the end of the trial (Week 52, end of the double-blind phase), were 0.9 mmHg and 1.1 mmHg respectively. The absolute and mean change in systolic BP and diastolic BP are summarized in <ref type="table">(Table 45</ref>). There were no human carcinogenicity data submitted with this sNDA.</p></div>

Reviewer comment: There were 6 subjects at 5 sites with heights that decreased between 1 and 2 cm from baseline to the end of the trial. This is likely due to measurement error.</p><p>The peak height velocity for girls is 9 cm per year, which occurs early in puberty. The peak height velocity for boys is 10.3 cm per year, and that occurs later in puberty <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Adelman and Johnson 2002)</ref>. In this trial, girls experienced an average 0.9 cm growth over the year-long trial, and boys experienced 5.0 cm growth. The mean ages of randomized males and females were 13.9 and 14.8 years, respectively. The girls were likely to be further along in puberty, which may explain the smaller height gain over the year trial, and the males were likely on average just entering puberty, so their height gain over the year may be less that expected.</p><p>The majority of the subjects remained in their Tanner stages for the duration of the trial, as assessed by the change from the beginning of the double-blind phase (Week 0) in the percentages of subjects at each Tanner stage. </p></div>
