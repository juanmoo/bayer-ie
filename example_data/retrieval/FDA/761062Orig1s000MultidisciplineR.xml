The proposed dose is 210 mg once monthly for one year. Romosozumab 210 mg is administered by a healthcare provider and requires 2 separate subcutaneous injections utilizing two single-use prefilled syringes. Romosozumab, also referred to as AMG785 in the application, is an IgG2 humanized monoclonal antibody that binds and inhibits sclerostin. The pharmacologic class proposed by the applicant in labeling is "sclerostin inhibitor". Sclerostin is the protein product of the SOST gene and is secreted by the osteocyte. Sclerostin is thought to act by binding to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 4, 5, and 6 (LRP4, LRP5, and LRP6), inhibiting Wingless-related integration (Wnt) signaling and reducing osteoblast-mediated bone formation. Inhibition of sclerostin leads to a transient stimulation of bone formation and inhibition of bone resorption. Romosozumab is first in class with sclerostin inhibitors being a new therapeutic class of osteoporosis treatments. This is the second review cycle for romosozumab. Late in the first review cycle of this BLA, data from an active-controlled, phase 3 fracture study in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis at increased risk for fracture, Study 20110142 (Study 142), became available and demonstrated an imbalance in positively adjudicated serious cardiovascular events for romosozumab vs. the active control alendronate. In response to the concerning cardiovascular safety findings, FDA issued a Complete Response Letter. This submission addresses the deficiencies outlined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions on the Substantial Evidence of Effectiveness</head><p>The applicant has provided substantial evidence of effectiveness to support approval of romosozumab for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture. The evidence of effectiveness derives from the placebo-controlled fracture trial 20070337 (Study 337) and the active-controlled fracture trial 20110142 (Study 142). These studies evaluated whether 12 months of treatment with romosozumab followed by continued therapy with an anti-resorptive agent provided fracture risk reduction in postmenopausal women.</p><p>Study 337 (N = 7180), reviewed in the first BLA cycle, was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study that assessed the efficacy and safety of romosozumab 210 mg administered subcutaneously (SC) every month (QM) for a duration of 12 months followed by denosumab 60 mg every 6 months for 12 months compared to 12 months of placebo followed by 12 months of denosumab in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. The study demonstrated a statistically significant reduction with romosozumab compared to placebo for both co-primary endpoints, which were 1) the subject incidence of new vertebral fractures at 12 months and 2) the subject incidence of new vertebral fractures at 24 months. During the 12-month double-blind period, the subject incidence of new vertebral fracture with absolute risk reduction of 1.3 0.8, 1.8; p &lt; 0.001) and relative risk reduction ; p &lt; 0.001). At 24 months, the subject incidence of new vertebral fracture with romosozumab followed by denosumab was 0.6 2.5 followed by denosumab, with a significant absolute risk reduction of 1.9 confidence 1.3, 2.5; p &lt; 0.001). and relative risk reduction CI: 60, 84; p &lt; 0.001). Romosozumab also significantly increased bone mineral density (BMD) at all sites. At month 12, compared with placebo, romosozumab increased mean maintained the increases in BMD at all sites at month 24.</p><p>Study 142 (N = 4093) was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, alendronate-controlled study that assessed the efficacy and safety of romosozumab 210 mg SC monthly for a duration of 12 months followed by alendronate 70 mg weekly compared with alendronate 70 mg weekly alone in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis with a history of fracture. Compared with Study 337, Study 142 enrolled a population at higher risk of osteoporosis-related fracture. The two primary endpoints were 1) time to first clinical fracture (including nonvertebral and symptomatic vertebral fracture, the applicant pre-specified this endpoint as "subject incidence of clinical fractures", which is not appropriate, see details in 8.1.1) through the primary analysis period and 2) the subject incidence of new vertebral fracture through month 24. The primary analysis period ended after clinical fracture events had been confirmed for at least 330 subjects and all subjects had completed the month 24 visit. At 24 months, the subject incidence of new vertebral fracture with romosozumab followed by alendronate with alendronate alone, with a significant and relative risk reduction of 50 ; p &lt; 0.001). Through the primary analysis period, the hazard ratio for clinical fractures was 0.73 0.61, 0.88; p &lt; 0.001) for romosozumab followed by alendronate compared to alendronate alone, based on 464 subjects with clinical fractures the the alendronate alone group) with a median follow-up of 33 months. Regarding BMD, significantly higher increases were observed with romosozumab compared to alendronate at all sites assessed. At month 12, the mean BMD treatment difference was femoral neck. Romosozumab followed by alendronate maintained the significantly higher increases in BMD at all sites at month 24.</p><p>The effect of romosozumab on the risk of vertebral fractures, clinical fractures and nonvertebral fractures in Study 337 and Study 142 is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_87">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Nonvertebral fractures were secondary endpoints in both studies. In Study 337, the risk reduction for nonvertebral fractures at 24 months observed with romosozumab followed by denosumab compared to placebo alone did not meet statistical significance when adjusted for multiplicity. In Study 142, romosozumab followed by alendronate significantly reduced the risk of nonvertebral fractures compared with alendronate alone through the primary analysis period, with a haz nonvertebral fractures with a median follow-up of 33 months.</p><p>The data suggested a potential reduction in hip fractures, however, Studies 337 and 142 were not designed adequately to demonstrate romosozumab's efficacy for reduction in hip fractures.</p><p>Additional analyses of the primary endpoints of Studies 337 and 142 (new vertebral fracture and clinical fracture in Study 142 and new vertebral fracture in Study 337) conducted in postmenopausal women did not identify differences in efficacy across subgroups defined by the following baseline characteristics: age, race, geographic region, baseline lumbar spine BMD Tscore, baseline total hip/femoral neck BMD T-score, baseline body mass index (BMI), fracture history, and Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) score. Likewise, subgroup analyses of NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} 16 percent change in BMD at the lumbar spine and total hip in Study 142 and Study 337 showed that romosozumab increased BMD over a wide range of baseline BMD T-scores and in subgroups defined by age and geographic region. The effects of romosozumab across these subgroups indicate that romosozumab can be effective in increasing BMD and reducing the risk for vertebral and nonvertebral fracture across a broad population of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit-Risk Assessment</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit-Risk Summary and Assessment</head><p>Romosozumab, trade name Evenity, is a sclerostin inhibitor proposed for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture. The dosing regimen is 210 mg administered by a healthcare professional once monthly for one year. The FDA has concluded that the benefits outweigh the risks and is granting approval.</p><p>Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone, which leads to bone fragility and increased fracture risk. Postmenopausal osteoporosis occurs due to the hormonal changes beginning at menopause which leads to increased bone loss. In the United States, about 8 million women aged 50 years or older have postmenopausal osteoporosis and approximately 1.5 million suffer osteoporosis-related fractures annually. The risk of fracture increases with age and a history of a prior osteoporosis-related fracture. Osteoporotic fractures can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Hip fractures are the most serious type of fractures and can impair the ability to walk and to live independently. Hip fractures are also associated with increased mortality.</p><p>Multiple effective treatments for postmenopausal osteoporosis are currently available. However, postmenopausal osteoporosis remains both underdiagnosed and undertreated in the United States. Approved therapies for postmenopausal osteoporosis include anti-resorptive agents (bisphosphonates, denosumab, calcitonin and raloxifene) as well as bone-forming (anabolic) agents (teriparatide and abaloparatide). These therapies with the exception of calcitonin, have been shown to reduce fracture. However, compliance, side effects, and some limitations on duration of use may be obstacles to treatment with these approved drugs.</p><p>The efficacy of romosozumab for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture was established in two fracture studies, Study 337 and Study 142 Study 337 (N = 7180) was a 24-month randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis aged 50 to 90 years (mean age of 71 years). Patients were randomized to receive one year of romosozumab 210 mg (N = 3589) or placebo (N = 3591) once monthly by subcutaneous injection administered by a healthcare professional. During the second year of the trial, all patients received denosumab 60 mg every 6 NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} 1 7 months. Patients also received daily supplemental calcium (500 to 1000 mg) and vitamin D (600 to 800 IU). At baseline, the mean T-score wasleast one prevalent vertebral fracture.</p><p>The co-primary endpoints of study 337 were the incidence of new vertebral fractures in patients treated with romosozumab compared to placebo at 12 months and the incidence of new vertebral fractures in patients treated with romosozumab then denosumab compared to placebo then denosumab at 24 months. During the 12-month double-blind romosozumab treatment per n p &lt; 0.001) and a p &lt; 0.001). At 24 months, the n absolute risk reduction of 1.9 1.3, 2.5; p &lt; 0.001) and a relative risk reduction Study 142 (N = 4093) was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, alendronate-controlled clinical trial in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and a history of a fracture aged 50 to 90 years (mean age of 74 years). Patients were randomized to receive one year of romosozumab 210 mg once monthly by subcutaneous injection administered by a healthcare professional or oral alendronate 70 mg once weekly. During the second year of the trial, all patients received oral alendronate 70 mg once weekly. Patients also received daily supplemental calcium (500 to 1000 mg) and vitamin D (600 to 800 IU). At baseline, the mean T-score was -3.0 at the lumbar spine and 96 vertebral fracture. Compared with Study 337, Study 142 enrolled a population at higher risk of osteoporosis-related fracture.</p><p>The coprimary endpoints of study 142 were the incidence of new morphometric vertebral fractures at month 24 and time to first clinical fracture (a composite of nonvertebral fracture and symptomatic vertebral fracture). The clinical fracture endpoint was event-driven and the primary analysis occurred when all subjects had reached 24 months of study participation and clinical fracture was confirmed in at least 330 subjects. At 24 months, the subject incidence of new alendronate alone, with an absolute risk reduction of 4.0 2.5, 5.6; p &lt; 0.001) and a relative risk reduction Through the primary analysis period the hazard ratio for romosozumab followed by alendronate compared to alendronate alone, based on 464 subjects with clinical fractures the the alendronate alone group) with a median follow-up of 33 months. Additionally, romosozumab followed by alendronate significantly reduced the risk of nonvertebral fractures compared with alendronate alone through the primary analysis period, with a hazard ratio of 0.81 0.66, 0.99; p &lt; 0.019), based on 395 subjects with nonvertebral fractures with a median follow-up of 33 months.</p><p>When considering the risks and benefits of romosozumab, hip fracture is associated with the highest morbidity and mortality. Hip fractures were recorded in both Studies 337 and 142. While NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} <ref type="bibr">1 8</ref> the data suggest a reduction in hip fractures, neither study was adequately designed to assess romosozumab for hip fracture reduction.</p><p>Romosozumab demonstrated statistically significant gains in BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck. Results for BMD increases were consistent across the phase 2 and phase 3 placebo-and active-controlled studies. For both Study 142 and Study 337, the treatment effects were consistent (relative risks favored romosozumab) in all subgroups of baseline characteristics examined, including age, race, geographic region, a range of baseline BMD T-scores, and subjects with a history of prior vertebral, nonvertebral, or fragility fracture. Although only a very small percentage of patients were from the United States in both studies <ref type="bibr">(1.8</ref> in Study 142), the consistent efficacy results among all subgroups support applicability of romosozumab effects on fracture risk reduction and extrapolation of efficacy results to the US population.</p><p>The safety profile of romosozumab is mainly derived from the two fracture clinical trials (studies 337 and 142). Important adverse events that occurred in the placebo-controlled fracture trial (Study 337) included hypersensitivity reactions, injection site reactions, hypocalcemia, osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) and atypical femoral fractures (AFF). Safety data from Study 142 confirmed the previously established risks of romosozumab. However, Study 142 also raised a new safety concern. In Study 142, there was an imbalance in serious cardiovascular events for romosozumab vs.</p><p>vs. during the 12-month double-blind period of the study.</p><p>This cardiovascular risk imbalance prompted additional analyses that focused on major adverse cardiac events (MACE), a composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke that is commonly used to assess cardiovascular risk or benefit. the romosozumab group experienced MACE However, when each fracture trial is considered separately, the results diverged. In the placebocontrolled Study 337, MACE:</p><p>and 30 romosozumab group experienced MACE, with a hazard ratio of contrast, in the active controlled S ts in the romosozumab group experienced MACE yielding a hazard ratio of 1.87 <ref type="bibr">( 1.11, 3.14)</ref>.</p><p>It is unclear whether romosozumab truly increases cardiovascular risk, as there are several factors that make the interpretation of the signal difficult. The fracture studies were not specifically designed to assess cardiovascular safety outcomes. Data regarding these events may not have been collected as rigorously as was necessary during the conduct of the studies to accurately capture all events. In addition, most of the analyses of the cardiovascular safety findings were conducted post-hoc after the imbalance in serious cardiovascular events in Study 142 was identified. Another limitation is the low number of MACE during the 12-month double-blind period of the fracture studies (approximately 60 events in each trial). Additionally, there is NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} <ref type="formula">1 9</ref> uncertainty regarding the applicability of the cardiovascular findings to the US population. Only and population of Study 142 were from the US, raising questions about the generalizability of the cardiovascular safety findings to the US population. Lastly, we are unable to rule out a cardioprotective effect of alendronate in Study 142 or that the findings were due to chance.</p><p>A definitive mechanistic cause to explain romosozumab's effect on the cardiovascular system has not been found. An alternate explanation for the cardiovascular findings has also not been found. Therefore, given the totality of the available data, and the uncertainty surrounding these data, major adverse cardiac events are considered potential risks of romosozumab therapy.</p><p>Other important safety risks of romosozumab include the following:</p><p>1. Hypersensitivity reactions: Like other monoclonal antibodies, romosozumab is associated with hypersensitivity reactions. Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, erythema multiforme, and urticaria, occurred in romosozumab-treated subjects in the clinical studies, but the incidence was low. 2. Hypocalcemia: Inhibition of sclerostin by romosozumab leads to rapid bone mass accrual at initiation of treatment and an increased demand for bone-building substrates such as calcium. Based on the clinical study data, hypocalcemia is an important identified risk. Mild and transitory decreases in albumin-corrected calcium and a compensatory increase in intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) were observed after initiation of romosozumab. Based on the totality of data, the risk of hypocalcemia is manageable, with adequate calcium and vitamin D intake recommended for all romosozumab-treated patients and monitoring of serum calcium in patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD). 3. Osteonecrosis of Jaw (ONJ): ONJ is an important risk of romosozumab due to its antiresorptive activity. There was one case of ONJ during treatment with romosozumab and two cases after romosozumab-treated subjects had transitioned to antiresorptive therapy. 4. Atypical Femur Fracture (AFF): AFF is an important risk of romosozumab due to its antiresorptive activity. Three cases of AFF were reported after romosozumab-treated subjects had transitioned to alendronate therapy. 5. Injection Site Reactions: There was a higher incidence of injection site reactions during the double-blind period in the romosozumab group than in the control groups in all phase 2 and 3 studies .</p><p>When all data are considered, the benefits outweigh the risks for one year of romosozumab therapy in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are at high risk of fracture and who have not had a recent myocardial infarction or stroke. Romosozumab reduces the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fracture. Although the fracture studies were not designed adequately to assess hip fracture, the outcome with the most associated morbidity and mortality, there were favorable point estimates in both studies for the romosozumab group compared to the control group, suggesting the potential for reduction in the risk of hip fractures on romosozumab. The evidence was not sufficient but the plausibility of an effect</p><p>Reference ID: 4416253 (b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(4)</ref> NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} 2 0 was considered in the benefit-risk assessment. Because of the different cardiovascular findings in the two large trials of romosozumab, it is not possible to exclude cardiovascular risk with romosozumab use. Given this potential risk, and the high risk of subsequent cardiac events in the year following a myocardial infarction or stroke, patients who are candidates for romosozumab therapy who have had a myocardial infarction or stroke within the prior year should not initiate romosozumab, as outlined in product labeling, including a Boxed Warning for prescribers and a Medication Guide for patients. Romosozumab's other risks are also adequately mitigated with labeling.</p><p>In addition to routine pharmacovigilance, a postmarketing study will be required to assess the impact of the boxed warning on romosozumab's prescribing patterns and potential for channeling bias. Depending on the findings of this study, a comparative safety study or trial may also be required to rule out an unacceptable increase in risk of MI, stroke, and cardiovascular death among users of romosozumab compared to users of an appropriate comparator(s).</p></div>

Rare but serious side effects with bisphosphonates (osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fractures) have reduced the use of these medications. Denosumab is a potent antiresorptive therapy that also is associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fractures. Denosumab is also associated with an increased risk of fracture after discontinuation. Teriparatide and abaloparatide are the only approved bone anabolic therapies.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Condition</head><p>Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone, which leads to bone fragility and increased fracture risk. Osteoporosis results from imbalances between resorption of bone by osteoclasts and formation of new bone by osteoblasts during bone remodeling. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines osteoporosis by bone mineral density (BMD) criteria obtained using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). A T-score is generated by measurements of the BMD at the lumbar NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} 25 spine, total hip, and femoral neck. Osteoporosis is defined by T-ons below the mean BMD of a young, healthy cohort of adults at the same location.</p><p>Osteoporosis is a common disorder, with the worldwide prevalence estimated to be around 200 million people according to the WHO. Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO), the most common type, is driven primarily by the hormonal changes beginning at menopause. In the US, an estimated 8.2 million women over age 50 years have postmenopausal osteoporosis and approximately 1.5 million sustain osteoporosis-related fractures annually <ref type="bibr">(NOF, 2018)</ref>. The prevalence of PMO and hence the number of osteoporosis-related fractures are projected to increase substantially as the US population ages. Osteoporotic fractures, most notably hip fractures, are associated with decreased quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality.</p><p>Despite the morbidity and mortality associated with osteoporosis, and the availability of multiple treatments to reduce fracture risk (as discussed below), osteoporosis remains underdiagnosed and undertreated.

Such fractures are defined solely by radiographic criteria and may be asymptomatic. Although the clinical effects of such fractures vary, as discussed above they are associated with increased morbidity and mortality and are a strong predictor of subsequent fractures (vertebral and nonvertebral). Additionally, vertebral fractures are the most common osteoporosis-related fractures in postmenopausal women <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Khosla, 2003)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref> lists the absolute and relative risk reductions (ARR and RRR, respectively) compared to placebo in new morphometric vertebral fractures (the primary endpoint) in the PMO trials of approved drugs. Risk reductions were generally apparent within 1 or 2 years and maintained through 3 years. Because the trial populations had different baseline fracture risks, ARR is highly variable between drugs and trials, while RRR is more consistent. For example, the FIT-1 trial of Fosamax enrolled a high-risk population (women with baseline vertebral fractures) whereas FIT-2 enrolled a lower risk population (no baseline fractures); fracture rates in both treatment groups were much higher in FIT-1, but relative reduction in fracture risk was nearly identical in the two studies. Nonvertebral fracture is not a required endpoint for regulatory approval. <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 5</ref> lists the ARR and RRR compared to placebo in the PMO trials of approved drugs that demonstrated statistically significant reductions in nonvertebral fracture risk.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of Presubmission/Submission Regulatory Activity</head><p>The romosozumab IND (100391) was opened in November 2006. For a detailed listing of presubmission regulatory activity, refer to the review of the original BLA submission (signed in DARRTS <ref type="bibr">May 3, 2017</ref>). An End of Phase 2 meeting was held in 2011. The applicant proposed to conduct a 12-month placebo-controlled phase 3 fracture trial. After discussion, the Division advised that the duration of the study should be a minimum of 2 years. It was acceptable that romosozumab treatment be limited to one year with all enrolled subjects (placebo and romosozumab treated subjects) receiving the same active control product for the second year. It was agreed that new vertebral fracture at 12 months and at 24 months could be coprimary efficacy endpoints.</p><p>The BLA was first submitted on July 19, 2016, with evidence of efficacy and safety from the 24month primary analysis of the phase 3 placebo-controlled fracture study in women with <ref type="bibr">PMO, Study 2007337 (Study 337)</ref>. Late in the first review cycle, data from an active-controlled, phase 3 fracture study in women with PMO at increased risk for fracture, Study 20110142 (Study 142), became available and demonstrated an imbalance in positively adjudicated serious cardiovascular events for romosozumab vs. the active control alendronate during the 12-month double-blind period of the study. Additionally, data from the recently completed 12-month placebo-controlled phase 3 BMD study in men with osteoporosis, Study 20110174 (Study 174), also indicated an imbalance in positively adjudicated serious cardiovascular events. The applicant requested a meeting with FDA to discuss these findings, which took place on May 19, 2017.</p><p>In response to the concerning cardiovascular safety findings of Study 142 and Study 174, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter on <ref type="bibr">July 13, 2017</ref>, which outlined the following:</p></div>

A similar signal was seen in Study 20110174, a smaller study comparing romosozumab to placebo in men with osteoporosis. These findings raise concerns that romosozumab may increase cardiovascular risk. Although Study 20070337 did not appear to have a cardiovascular safety signal, these disparate findings across studies require detailed review once the completed final analyses have been submitted. These additional data, including the efficacy data from the head-to-head comparison of romosozumab to alendronate, are needed before we can complete the benefit/risk assessment and determine whether the benefits of romosozumab outweigh its risks.</p><p>TO ADDRESS THIS DEFICIENCY: Complete analyses of Studies 20110142 and 20110174.

FDA requested an analysis of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE), a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke, as well as analyses of each of these individual components. Additionally, because of the early separation of events in the treatment groups (by Month 2), FDA recommended that the cardiovascular safety analyses include demonstration that romosozumab does not have off-target effects on platelet aggregation (e.g., via an in vitro platelet aggregation study), vasoconstriction, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. FDA also requested an analysis of non-serious cardiac ischemic events (e.g., angina).</p><p>The BLA was resubmitted on July 9, 2018. The resubmission addressed the requirements put forth in the Complete Response letter and the recommendations communicated to the applicant at the End of Review meeting.</p><p>On January 4, 2019, the applicant submitted a clinical information amendment outlining all changes that resulted from additional data available through the end of the final analysis periods of Studies 337 and 142 (as compared to what was initially reported in the clinical study reports, which covered the primary analysis periods of the studies). This constituted a major amendment to the application. On January 7, 2019, FDA notified the applicant that the PDUFA goal date would therefore be extended by three months to allow time for a thorough review of this amendment.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Executive Summary</head><p>The Applicant carried out a comprehensive nonclinical program for the original BLA submission that included pharmacology, pharmacokinetics/ADME and toxicology studies.</p><p>Prompted by the adverse cardiovascular findings in Study 142, the sponsor conducted five additional nonclinical studies to examine the potential risk of sclerostin inhibition for acute ischemic cardiovascular events. A study to assess the risk for osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) was also conducted.</p><p>The new studies showed (A) in an in vitro study: no activation of human platelets by romosozumab; (B) in the ovariectomized (OVX) ApoE knockout (KO) mouse atherosclerosis model: no effects of sclerostin antibody on systemic markers of inflammation or endothelial activation, no meaningful qualitative or quantitative effects of sclerostin antibody treatment on aortic atherosclerotic lesions except for a decrease in plaque volume at end of study, and no effects of sclerostin antibody on gene transcription that would be consistent with an atherogenic effect; (C) in human artery atherosclerotic plaques: no expression of sclerostin in vulnerable plaque areas, and generally no association between sclerostin expression and plaque features or cardiovascular events observed in the plaque donors; (D) in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) database: no genetic association between risk of osteoporosis or fracture and risk of MI or stroke; and (E) in human coronary artery rings: no vasoconstrictive effect of romosozumab or human sclerostin. An additional nonclinical study showed lack of induction of ONJ-like lesions by sclerostin antibody in OVX rats with experimental periodontitis.</p><p>The Applicant discussed the concerns about cardiovascular safety, particularly the potential for ischemic events, from a nonclinical perspective based on the available nonclinical data and current literature. The concerns included potential roles of sclerostin in vascular calcification and atherosclerosis-associated pathology. The data from previously conducted nonclinical studies suggested that sclerostin inhibition does not induce or exacerbate vascular calcification. The data from the newly conducted study in the mouse atherosclerosis model showing lack of an effect of sclerostin antibody on mineralized plaque volume appeared to confirm this conclusion. Additionally, the fact that the inverse relationship between sclerostin expression and dystrophic calcification in human carotid arterial plaques was unlikely to reflect a direct relationship also strengthened this conclusion.</p><p>The atherosclerosis study in the ApoE KO mice was the most elaborate new nonclinical study conducted. The results of this 16-week study did not suggest exacerbation of atherosclerosis or significant transcriptional changes in aortic plaques as a result of antibody-mediated sclerostin inhibition. Accordingly, the reduced expression of sclerostin in human and mouse atherosclerotic plaques does not appear to be causally related to atherosclerosis or its</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of previous studies</head><p>Sclerostin is an extracellular inhibitor of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and is produced mainly by the osteocyte. A comprehensive nonclinical study program was conducted to support the original BLA submission.</p><p>NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} 3 7</p><p>Romosozumab blocks the interaction of sclerostin with low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)5 and LRP6, two co-receptors involved in Wnt signaling, thereby activating the Wnt pathway in osteoblastic cells.</p><p>In humans, romosozumab transiently stimulates bone formation and inhibits bone resorption, based on evaluation of bone turnover markers. In 12-month bone quality studies in ovariectomized (OVX) rats and monkeys, at doses equivalent to <ref type="bibr">1-19x and 1-22x</ref> the human AUC(0-y subcutaneous dose of 210 mg, respectively, romosozumab increased bone mass and strength of the lumbar spine, tibia, femur, and radius in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Bone formation and resorption markers were rapidly and transiently increased. The bone changes consisted of increases in trabecular thickness in vertebrae and long bone metaphyses and increases in cortical thickness in long bone metaphyses and diaphyses. These effects were due to stimulation of bone formation concomitant with suppression of bone resorption, mostly at trabecular and endosteal bone surfaces, as observed by histomorphometry. An improvement in bone quality was observed in the vertebrae of rats and monkeys at 19-22x human exposure multiples. Bone quality was maintained at all other evaluated sites.</p><p>Toxicity studies of up to 6-month duration were conducted in rats and monkeys. The main findings were related to the pharmacologic effect of romosozumab and included red blood cell, white blood cell and platelet decreases, serum calcium and phosphorus decreases, and extramedullary hematopoiesis. The effects were associated with hyperostosis and increases in bone formation and densitometric parameters. Exposure multiples in the 6-month studies ranged from 1-38x and 1-93x human exposure, in rats and monkeys, respectively. Assessments of local tolerance did not reveal significant concerns.</p><p>A carcinogenicity study was conducted in Sprague Dawley rats. The rats were dosed for up to 98 weeks with 0, 3, 10, 50 mg/kg/week, equivalent to 1-19x human exposure. Romosozumab did not affect mortality and caused a dose-dependent increase in bone mass with trabecular and cortical bone thickening at all doses. Romosozumab did not cause significant increases in tumor incidences in males or females. A low incidence of osteosarcoma (2/54) was observed in high dose males at 19x human exposure. However, the lack of statistical significance of this finding and the large exposure multiple suggests that romosozumab is unlikely to increase the human risk of osteosarcoma.</p><p>Reproductive toxicity was evaluated in rat fertility and early embryonic development (FEED), embryofetal development (EFD) and pre-and postnatal development (PPND) studies. Findings in the definitive FEED and EFD studies included reduced ventral processes of the 6 th cervical vertebrae at doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg (17-56x human exposure). However, this anatomical structure is not present in humans and the finding is not considered clinically relevant. Fetal poly-and syndactyly were observed in the definitive EFD study at 32x human exposure, consistent with the syndactyly that has been observed in sclerosteosis patients and SOST knockout mice. Although it may have been treatment-related, the finding is considered of low NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} 38 clinical relevance based on the exposure multiple and the timing of digit formation in the first trimester in humans when placental transfer of immunoglobulins is limited. In the PPND study, there were small decreases in femoral bone density and/or thickness in the F1 offspring at 1.5-56x human exposure of unclear biological significance. None of these findings are considered relevant for the postmenopausal indication.</p><p>In the original BLA submission, the sponsor evaluated multiple potential safety concerns based on the weight of evidence from nonclinical studies, clinical studies and published literature. There was no indication that romosozumab would increase the risks for vascular calcification, but potential effects on processes underlying cardiovascular ischemic events were not considered at the time. Increased risks for osteoarthritis, altered longitudinal bone growth, hyperostosis, hypercementosis, altered hematopoiesis or glucose metabolism, sarcopenia, and -mediated inflammation were also considered unlikely. The risk of vascular calcification is further discussed in the general discussion of concerns about cardiovascular effects of sclerostin at the end of this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nonclinical Evaluation of Sclerostin and Cardiovascular Disease</head><p>To further address the imbalance in serious cardiovascular (CV) events observed in clinical studies and to assess the plausibility of a treatment related effect, the sponsor conducted five new non-GLP nonclinical pharmacology studies with romosozumab or a rat surrogate sclerostinantibody (r13C7), which is romosozumab engineered with rat Fc. A study of the effects of r13C7 in a rodent model of ONJ was also conducted ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_92">Table 6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of sclerostin antibody r13C7 on potential transcriptional and morphologic changes in atherosclerotic plaques in aortas from high fat diet-fed ovariectomized (OVX) Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) knockout (KO) mice (ApoE KO-OVX mice) compared with high fat diet-fed OVX Wild Type (WT) mice (WT-OVX mice). The effects of alendronate for 16 weeks were also evaluated.</p><p>The ApoE KO mouse model is a well-known model of atherogenesis. ApoE plays a key protective role in atherosclerosis. First, plasma ApoE maintains plasma cholesterol homeostasis by facilitating hepatic uptake of lipoprotein remnants.

The increase in PINP was variable and averaged approximately ALN for 16 weeks led to a significant reduction in serum PINP in ApoE KO OVX mice, as expected for an antiresorptive drug.</p><p>Levels of OPG (osteoprotegerin) (inhibitor of osteoclast formation/maturation and also a known Wnt target gene and negative regulator of vascular calcification) were lower in ApoE KO-OVX mice than in WT mice on Days 57 and 113.

There were also a few transient changes, usually decreases on Day 57 only, in a couple of markers in r13C7-treated but not vehicle-treated WT or ApoE KO animals, e.g. a decrease in E-Selectin in r13C7-treated ApoE KO mice. However, in general, r13C7 did not significantly alter these markers in either WT or ApoE KO OVX mice. Based on the lack of an effect of r13C7 on P-selectin and CD40L in both genotypes, sclerostin inhibition had no effect on platelet activation.</p><p>In WT-OVX mice, a limited number of Wnt target genes, or genes known to be regulated by sclerostin antibody related to ossification and bone mineralization, were differentially expressed in the aorta of r13C7-treated animals at Week 3 (only), and an acute response pre-Week 3 cannot be excluded. Some genes involved in ECM organization were also differentially expressed at Week 3 in r13C7 vs. vehicle treated WT mice.</p><p>In ApoE KO-OVX mice, r13C7 treatment led to a significant gene expression change in 3 pathways at Week 8, but the enrichment of these pathways was driven by only a small number of genes. The pathways did not intersect with the atherosclerosis-related pathways identified by genotype (ApoE KO-OVX vs. WT-OVX) comparison and are therefore unlikely to play a role in atherosclerosis progression. Two of these pathways were related to triglyceride synthesis and vascular calcification, respectively, possibly playing a role in arterial disease. However, this is weak evidence for a significant vascular effect of sclerostin antibody. At week 16, only 4 genes changed expression, and no pathways were significantly enriched.</p><p>In the ApoE KO-OVX mice, no Wnt target genes or sclerostin antibody responsive bone genes significantly changed expression due to r13C7 treatment at any time point. However, Dkk2, a known Wnt antagonist, was upregulated (about 2-fold) with r13C7 treatment at week 3. In ApoE KO-OVX mice, there was no clear evidence of upregulation by r13C7 of genes involved in ECM structure, bone mineralization, and cell cycle. Sclerostin antibody had no effect on prostaglandin signaling genes in ApoE KO-OVX mice, suggesting a lack of related prothrombotic effects.</p><p>Thus, RNA sequencing did not identify a typical gene expression signature attributable to r13C7 treatment that would be associated with the development or progression of atherosclerosis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SOST and Dkk1</head><p>In bone, expression of Wnt antagonists Dkk1 and SOST is upregulated in response to sclerostin antibody treatment, possibly explaining the attenuation of the bone effect over time. In the current study, the Dkk1 gene was not expressed in mouse aorta in any of the conditions NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} <ref type="bibr">4 5</ref> examined. SOST expression was downregulated in ApoE KO-OVX vs. WT-OVX mouse aortas at Weeks 8 and 16, suggesting atherosclerosis might be associated with Wnt pathway inhibition and feedback SOST decrease. However, the lack of changes in Wnt pathway genes in ApoE KO-OVX vs. WT-OVX mice, described above, contradicts this hypothesis. SOST expression was not affected by r13C7 treatment in either WT-OVX or ApoE KO-OVX mice at any time point, which is different from the increase in SOST expression in bone upon sclerostin antibody treatment and osteoblastic Wnt activation.</p><p>To understand the SOST downregulation in ApoE KO-OVX mouse aorta, an analysis was performed on relevant genes differentially expressed in ApoE KO-OVX vs. WT-OVX mice. The data showed that upstream regulators compatible with both upregulation and downregulation of SOST expression were enriched in ApoE KO-OVX vs. WT-OVX mouse aorta. However, it is unclear which of these regulators is a major modulator of SOST expression in the vasculature.</p><p>While systemic markers of inflammation or endothelial activation were not affected by r13C7 (above), several genes related to inflammation, e.g. MCP-1, IL-6, and ICAM1, were locally upregulated in the aorta of ApoE KO-OVX mice, consistent with the local upregulation of inflammation signaling pathways. The expression of these genes was not affected by r13C7 in either genotype. There was no evidence of in vivo platelet activation in WT or ApoE KO-OVX mice by sclerostin antibody, since P-selectin and CD40L were unaltered.</p><p>Thus, the data indicate that Scl-Ab r13C7 does not affect atherosclerosis-related gene expression in aortic arch tissue.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The action of sclerostin antibody r13C7 was investigated in the high fat diet-fed ApoE KO-OVX mouse, an established mouse model for atherosclerosis, following ovariectomy. Administration of r13C7 by subcutaneous injection once weekly at a dose of 10 mg/kg (predicted to be 4-fold greater than the clinical exposure of romosozumab of 210 mg once monthly) for <ref type="bibr">3, 8, or 16</ref> weeks was well tolerated in ovariectomized (OVX) ApoE KO and WT mice. There was no genotype effect on the levels of systemic markers of inflammation or endothelial/platelet activation (cytokines/chemokines). Sclerostin inhibition by r13C7 also had no significant effects on these markers in either WT-OVX or ApoE KO-OVX mice. Sclerostin antibody had no meaningful effects on the incidence of atherosclerotic plaques in ApoE KO-OVX mice. There was an increase in the incidence of plaques with necrosis at Week 16, but no effect on plaque fibrocartilaginous metaplasia at any time point in ApoE KO-OVX mice. The increase in plaque necrosis may signal a concern about increased plaque instability. Sclerostin antibody decreased aortic total plaque volume at Week 16, but the significance of this finding is unclear in the context of the other study results. Sclerostin antibody had no effect on the mineralized plaque volume in ApoE KO-OVX mice. Sclerostin antibody did not result in gene transcriptional changes in aorta tissue that would be expected to affect the development or progression of atherosclerosis. Sclerostin (SOST) gene expression decreased with the progression of atherosclerosis in ApoE KO-OVX mice but was unaffected by r13C7 administration in both genotypes. Alendronate for 16 weeks did not alter total or mineralized plaque volume or plaque histologic features in ApoE KO-OVX mice. The findings generally support the concept that inhibition of sclerostin by r13C7 does not promote atheroprogression in the OVX ApoE KO mouse model. However, the data on plaque necrosis suggest a potential concern about increased plaque instability.</p></div>

The association between sclerostin expression and factors known to predispose to plaque rupture, i.e., lipid content, macrophage content, smooth muscle cell content, collagen content, calcification, and intraplaque hemorrhage was also determined.</p><p>Reference ID: 4416253 (b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(4)</ref> (b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(4)</ref> NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} 47 Methods A retrospective analysis was performed on 94 carotid artery plaques and 50 femoral/iliac artery plaques collected from women. Samples were accessed from the AtheroExpress biobank of embedded atherosclerotic plaque samples that had been collected during surgical endarterectomy. Serial sections were stained for expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (aSMA) and human sclerostin, and a third section was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). Sections were scored to reflect the extent and location of sclerostin staining and the results were combined with pre-existing AtheroExpress data pertaining to the plaques selected and the clinical characteristics of the patients. Two control formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) aorta specimens were also stained for sclerostin. The types of plaques assessed in this study were considered representative of those found in post-menopausal women.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The aorta consists of three layers, the Tunica Adventitia (T.adventitia), Tunica media (T.media), and Tunica intima (T.intima) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). Sclerostin staining revealed generally low expression in the T.media of the arterial plaques examined, with the majority no expression. Strong staining was observed in the vessel wall of a limited number of early atherosclerotic plaque samples with only minimal to slight expansion of the T. intima, as well as in control FFPE aorta. Staining was already decreased in intensity in the region immediately deep to the intimal expansion, indicating sclerostin expression decreases early in plaque formation. Advanced lesions typically showed low or absent staining. Where present, sclerostin expression was restricted to deeper parts of the plaque/vessel wall, i.e., the T. media and adjacent sub-intimal region, where it was of decreased intensity compared to control aorta. Expression of sclerostin was never seen in the superficial plaque region closest to the vessel lumen (fibrous cap and endothelium) which are relevant to plaque stability. Absence of sclerostin expression was not associated with age at endarterectomy, history of artery disease or cardiac outcomes during the patient follow up period of at least 3 years. Absence of sclerostin was also not associated with plaque pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (MCP1, IL6, and osteopontin), and was not associated with most of the plaque features assessed including lipid content, macrophage content, collagen content, and hemorrhage.</p><p>Absence of sclerostin expression was associated with two plaque features. One feature was moderate/heavy dystrophic calcification in the T. intima and T. media of the carotid (not femoral) artery, which is a feature of advanced plaques. The report's authors concluded that given the common absence of sclerostin from plaques in the study and given that downregulation of sclerostin appears to occur during plaque progression, the absence of sclerostin expression in plaques with dystrophic calcification most likely reflects the advanced nature of the atherosclerosis in these plaques rather than a direct association with calcification per se. There was also an association between the absence of sclerostin and moderate/heavy smooth muscle cell (SMC) content in the T. intima but not the T. media in the femoral (not carotid) artery, but this was not further discussed.</p><p>Elevated sclerostin has been shown to reduce circulating levels of the pro-inflammatory However, the current study showed no relationship between sclerostin expression and the presence of any of these cytokines in atherosclerotic plaques.</p></div>

The responses to both sclerostin-antibody and sclerostin were similar to those of the vehicle control.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Since romosozumab is an inhibitor of bone resorption, it may be associated with a rare side effect, osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). Therefore, this study was conducted in aged OVX rats with ligature-induced experimental periodontitis to examine the potential for sclerostin inhibition to increase the risk for ONJ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Female Sprague Dawley rats were ovariectomized at 6 months of age followed by a 2-month bone depletion period. Rats were then administered either weekly intraperitoneal injections of sclerostin antibody (r13C7). The dose of sclerostin antibody was predicted to provide a similar systemic exposure as the 210 mg once monthly clinical dose of romosozumab, based on AUC. After 12 weeks of treatment, periodontitis was induced with a ligature around the left maxillary second molar. Animals were necropsied after an additional 10-week treatment period. Study endpoints included evaluation of serum bone formation marker PINP at pre-dose, weeks 6, 12, and 22, ex-vivo micro-CT of dissected maxillae and vertebrae, histopathologic evaluation of the maxillae, and histomorphometry of vertebral cancellous bone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Sclerostin antibody r13C7 transiently increased serum PINP and increased mineralizing surface (MS/BS) and bone volume in vertebral cancellous bone, consistent with the expected stimulation of bone formation by sclerostin inhibition. In vertebral bone, ZA decreased bone formation (MS/BS), and sclerostin antibody suppressed bone resorption (ES/BS). Vehicletreated animals showed extensive alveolar bone loss and inflammatory infiltrate in areas of experimental periodontitis. By contrast, ZA-treated animals showed minimal alveolar bone loss and a reduced number of osteoclasts. In sclerostin antibody treated rats, bone loss was also markedly reduced compared to vehicle controls, but osteoclastic bone resorption did not appear suppressed. ZA-treated but not sclerostin antibody treated rats developed radiographic and histologic features of ONJ, evidenced by a marked increase in the relative area of osteonecrotic bone containing empty osteocytic lacunae and by increased bone exposure. Features of ONJ were not observed in sclerostin antibody treated animals. The alveolar bone of sclerostin antibody and vehicle treated animals had a similar appearance, with minimal Reference ID: 4416253 (b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(4)</ref> (b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(4)</ref> NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} 52 osteonecrosis (relative area approximately histologic evidence of active bone resorption.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion of concerns (nonclinical perspective)</head><p>In the attempt to clarify the observed imbalance in serious CV events observed in the alendronate-controlled Study 142 and in Study 174, the sponsor discussed the concerns regarding potential cardiovascular effects of sclerostin inhibition based on nonclinical studies and published literature. The issues addressed included: (1) medial vascular calcification, <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(2)</ref> potential effects on pathophysiological mechanisms underlying thrombotic/ischemic events such as MI and stroke (plaque rupture, plaque erosion, and vasospasm), and (3) potential association between genetic variability in sclerostin expression and MI or stroke based on human genetics data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vascular calcification</head><p>Sclerostin is expressed in the aorta of several species (mouse, monkey, human). Since there have been reports of upregulation of sclerostin in foci of vascular calcification in mice, rats and humans, and sclerostin has been shown to inhibit mineralization by bone cells, it has been suggested that sclerostin may function as a negative regulator of vascular calcification However, conflicting data showing low expression of sclerostin in normal or calcified human vasculature indicate that the role of sclerostin in the aorta is unclear and its presence may simply be a marker of the calcification process. Data from previously conducted nonclinical studies did not show evidence of adverse effects of sclerostin inhibition on the vasculature in the absence of vascular mineralization. There were no vascular effects in a 6-month repeatdose monkey toxicity study conducted with romosozumab at up to 93-fold clinical exposure based on AUC (Study 107426), and no vascular mineralization in aged OVX monkeys dosed for 1 year with romosozumab at 22-fold clinical AUC exposure (Study 107903). Vascular lesions were also not observed in a 6-month rat study with romosozumab at up to 39-fold clinical AUC exposure.</p><p>Although sclerostin expression is absent or low in rat aorta (Study 119937), aortic medial calcification has been observed in rats secondary to experimental chronic kidney disease (CKD), and sclerostin expression is upregulated in foci of vascular calcification. However, aortic calcification is not exacerbated when these rats are treated with sclerostin antibody and is not promoted in the total absence of sclerostin in SOST KO mice with CKD. In addition, romosozumab had no effect on the incidence or severity of spontaneous age-related arterial pathology characterized by focal medial vascular calcification or ectopic ossification in normal rats dosed for up to 98 weeks at up to 19-fold the clinical AUC exposure (Study 107895).</p><p>NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} <ref type="bibr">5 3</ref> Thus, sclerostin inhibition does not appear to cause initiation of vascular calcification or exacerbation of pre-existing medial calcification in animals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanisms underlying MI and stroke</head><p>Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease and most commonly underlies thrombotic/ischemic events such as MI and stroke. Specific mechanisms that can lead to these events include plaque rupture, plaque erosion and vasospasm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Atherosclerosis</head><p>In Amgen Study #2 (124609) in the ApoE KO OVX mouse atherosclerosis model, it was shown that treatment with sclerostin antibody r13C7 had no significant effects on systemic inflammation markers or on atherosclerosis or aortic transcriptional changes.</p><p>The results were in apparent contrast with those obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Krishna et al. (2017)</ref> in the ApoE KO male mouse treated with Angiotensin-II (Ang II) for 28 days, a model for atherosclerosis and aortic aneurysm (AA). Ang II plays a critical role in the induction of atherosclerosis and may accelerate the progression of atherosclerotic lesions to infarction. In that study, excess SOST (in SOST-transgenic ApoE KO mouse, or in ApoE KO mice injected with SOST) inhibited Ang IIinduced aortic aneurysm and atherosclerosis, and was associated with reductions in circulating proinflammatory cytokines (MCP-1, IL-6 and TNFdegradation and macrophage infiltration. The sponsor commented that the contrasting findings between the two studies suggest that the consequence of overexpression of SOST or excess sclerostin does not predict the effects of inhibition of sclerostin with sclerostin antibody administered at 'non-saturating' doses.</p><p>The differences between the studies may be due to the different animal models used. The administration of Ang II in the mouse model used in the published study <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Krishna et al., 2017)</ref> may specifically contribute to atherosclerosis and/or aneurysm through activation of sclerostinsensitive Wnt signaling. In fact, the study showed that Wnt signaling was activated in Ang IItreated ApoE KO mice that developed aortic aneurysms vs. those that did not, and that SOST expression in human aortic aneurysm samples was decreased possibly through epigenetic silencing. In the sponsor's study in ApoE KO mice not treated with Ang II, there was no difference in Wnt target gene expression between control and ApoE KO mice. Therefore, atherosclerosis in this model appears to be Wnt-independent, which may explain the lack of effect of sclerostin antibody. It is unlikely that the sclerostin antibody dose selection was inadequate.</p><p>The role of Wnt signaling in cardiac and vascular disease has recently been reviewed <ref type="bibr">(Foulqier et al., 2018)</ref>. Interestingly, the article highlights the crosstalk between WNT, TGF-and Angiotensin II signaling. The authors concluded that, despite conflicting experimental data, a general picture is emerging that excessive stimulation of WNT signaling adversely affects cardiovascular pathology.</p><p>NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} <ref type="bibr">5 4</ref> A study in the ApoE KO mouse similar to the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Krishna et al.

Conversely, an evaluation of the effect of sclerostin antibody in the Ang II-treated mouse could be conducted to identify a potentially atherosclerosis-enhancing effect.</p><p>Regardless, a positive result in any model would not negate the lack of an imbalance on serious cardiovascular events observed in clinical Study 337. Similarly, the negative result of the completed study in the ApoE KO OVX mouse does not refute the cardiovascular safety signal in clinical Studies 142 and 174. Ultimately the role of sclerostin and its inhibition in these cardiovascular events remains unclear.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Plaque rupture</head><p>Plaque rupture can be induced by inflammation and altered immunity via a reduction in extracellular matrix, particularly the plaque's fibrous cap. However, the study in the ApoE KO-OVX mice (Study 124609) did not show an effect of sclerostin antibody r13C7 on inflammatory markers or on the transcription of genes that play a role in inflammation, adaptive immunity, or ECM homeostasis, even though the latter genes were differentially regulated in ApoE KO-OVX vs. WT mice. In this context, the relevance of the slight decrease in plaque volume in the r13C7treated ApoE KO-OVX mice at Week 16, e.g. for plaque rupture, is unclear. Plaque rupture can also be caused by mechanical instability due to calcification or hemorrhage. However, romosozumab did not promote vascular calcification in the previously conducted rat and monkey toxicity studies, and sclerostin inhibition did not cause aortic calcification in CKD rodents. Also, sclerostin antibody r13C7 did not affect mineralized plaque volume in Study 124609, and sclerostin was not expressed in human atherosclerotic plaques' fibrous caps, a location that is important for the plaque's stability <ref type="bibr">(Study 150498)</ref>. In addition, plaque hemorrhage was not observed in ApoE KO-OVX mice (Study 124609) and sclerostin expression was not correlated with human arterial plaque hemorrhage. Plaque necrosis is an additional feature potentially associated with increased plaque instability. The increase in the incidence of plaques with necrosis upon dosing of ApoE KO-OVX mice with sclerostin antibody may suggest a possible role for sclerostin in plaque rupture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Plaque erosion</head><p>Plaque erosion due to endothelial apoptosis/dysfunction in combination with platelet adhesion and activation, neutrophil activation, and local oxidative stress is believed to enhance thrombogenesis and precipitate cardiovascular ischemic events. In ApoE KO-OVX mice, transcriptional pathways related to apoptosis, innate immunity, neutrophil recruitment/signaling and oxidative stress were upregulated, but these pathways were not affected by sclerostin antibody administration. Furthermore, sclerostin antibody treatment did not affect circulating markers of endothelial activation and their aortic mRNA expression <ref type="bibr">(Study 124609)</ref>. In addition, based on the lack of sclerostin expression in the T. intima and endothelium in human atherosclerotic plaques, sclerostin inhibition seems to be an unlikely factor in plaque erosion.</p><p>NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} <ref type="bibr">5 5</ref> Both plaque rupture and erosion can be complicated by enhanced thrombogenesis triggered by an imbalance in vasodilators (e.g. the prostanoids prostacyclin, PGl2) and vasoconstrictors (e.g. platelet thromboxane A2, TXA2). However, in the aorta of ApoE KO-OVX mice, gene transcription related to the prostanoid pathway, while differentially regulated than in WT mice, was not affected by sclerostin antibody. Circulating markers of endothelial/platelet activation were also not changed by sclerostin antibody treatment (Study 124609). In addition, romosozumab did not enhance in vitro platelet activation at up to 10-fold the clinical Cmax achieved with 210 mg once monthly <ref type="bibr">(Study 125269)</ref>. Moreover, in rat and monkey repeat dose toxicity studies, intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation was not affected by romosozumab, altogether suggesting a lack of effect of sclerostin inhibition on thrombogenesis.</p></div>

Additionally, although nitric oxide signaling pathways were differentially regulated in the ApoE KO-OVX mouse, these pathways were unchanged in response to sclerostin antibody treatment <ref type="bibr">(Study 124609)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives</head><p>The primary objective of this study was to assess the effect of romosozumab treatment for 12 months followed by alendronate (ALN) treatment compared with ALN treatment alone on the subject incidence of the following during the primary analysis period:</p><p>NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} <ref type="bibr">6 2</ref> clinical fracture (nonvertebral fracture and symptomatic vertebral fracture) in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis; and new vertebral fracture in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis</p><p>The secondary objectives of the study included the following: to assess the effect of romosozumab treatment for 12 months followed by ALN treatment compared with ALN treatment alone on the following during the primary analysis period: wo vertebral fracture, and clinical vertebral fracture); and Percent changes in DXA BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck. to assess the effect of romosozumab treatment for 12 months compared with ALN treatment on the following during the 12-month double-blind ALN-controlled study period:</p><p>fracture and fracture and new or worsening vertebral fracture, hip fracture, clinical vertebral forearm, humerus, Percent changes in DXA BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck to assess the effect of romosozumab treatment for 12 months followed by ALN treatment compared with ALN treatment alone on subject incidence of hip fracture, ring the overall study period.</p><p>The term "clinical" vertebral fracture refers to those vertebral fractures that are symptomatic. Many vertebral fractures are asymptomatic and are detected incidentally on radiographic imaging.</p><p>The use of an active control in Study 142 enabled a direct comparison of romosozumab efficacy to a currently approved therapy. The active control, alendronate, an oral bisphosphonate that reduces fracture risk by decreasing bone resorption and subsequently increasing bone density, represented a different mechanism of action from the bone-forming agent teriparatide that was used in Study 289, the other active-controlled study in the romosozumab clinical program (discussed in review of the original BLA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head><p>Study 142 was a phase 3, multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, alendronate-controlled study of romosozumab in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.</p><p>NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} <ref type="bibr">6 3</ref> The study was designed to evaluate whether romosozumab treatment for 12 months followed by alendronate, compared with alendronate treatment alone, is effective in reducing the incidence of clinical fracture and new vertebral fracture.</p><p>Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio (stratified by a receive either romosozumab 210 mg subcutaneously (SC) every month (QM) or alendronate 70 mg orally every week (QW) in a blinded fashion for the duration of the 12-month double-blind alendronate-controlled study period. All subjects also received matched placebo for either alendronate or romosozumab. After the initial 12-month study period, subjects received alendronate for the remainder of the study while remaining blinded to their initial treatment assignment (romosozumab or alendronate).</p><p>The primary analyses were to be performed at the end of the primary analysis period, which was defined as when clinical fracture events were confirmed for at least 330 subjects and all subjects completed the month 24 study visit. Upon completion of the primary analysis period, the study was to continue until at least 440 subjects experienced a nonvertebral fracture (unless the superiority of romosozumab was already proven for nonvertebral fractures at the primary analysis).</p><p>Approximately 200 subjects at participating centers were also enrolled in an Imaging and pharmacokinetic/bone turnover marker (PK/BTM)/Biomarker substudy. Within this substudy, a subset of approximately 100 subjects were planned to participate in the imaging (DXA, QCT) portion of the substudy.</p><p>The study schema is presented in <ref type="figure">Figure .</ref>   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key Enrollment Criteria</head><p>Subjects included ambulatory postmenopausal women age 55 to 90 years with at least 1 of the following BMD and fracture criteria:</p><p>BMD T-score at the total hip or femoral neck of -2.50 and EITHER: -at least 1 moderate (SQ2) or severe (SQ3) vertebral fracture OR -at least 2 mild (SQ1) vertebral fractures OR BMD T-score at the total hip or femoral neck of -2.00 and EITHER: -at least 2 moderate (SQ2) or severe (SQ3) vertebral fractures OR -a fracture of the proximal femur that occurred within 3 to 24 months prior to randomization.</p><p>In addition, at least 1 hip must have been evaluable by DXA. Key exclusion criteria included a history of metabolic or bone diseases, severe and significant lab abnormalities, organ or bone marrow transplants, or possible diagnosis of multiple myeloma or related lymphoproliferative disorder. The use of agents affecting bone metabolism was also exclusionary; however, for selected therapies permissible off-treatment periods prior to randomization were allowed as outlined in Section 4.2 of the study protocol. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria for the main study are provided in Section 4 of the study protocol.</p><p>Subjects participating in the imaging component of the Imaging and PK/BTM/Biomarker Substudy were to be excluded if they had the following: a non-evaluable vertebra in the region of interest for spine QCT scans as assessed by the central imaging vendor at the time of screening, based on lateral spine x-rays; a nonvertebral fracture or clinical vertebral fracture within 6 months prior to enrollment; or were unavailable for protocol-required substudy procedures.</p><p>The eligibility criteria were appropriate to ensure that the population only included subjects at high risk for fracture (which is acceptable for an active-controlled trial) and were adequate to ensure reliable interpretation of efficacy results. The participants in Study 142 were at higher risk for subsequent fracture than the participants in the placebo-controlled Study 337. Study 337 had exclusionary criteria based on severity of prior fracture (including hip fracture) and low BMD T-scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods for Treatment Assignment and Blinding</head><p>Treatment assignments were obtained through an interactive voice response system (IVRS). Eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio in a double-blind manner to either the romosozumab or the alendronate treatment group. Randomization was stratified by age (&lt; 75 NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} <ref type="formula">6 5</ref> years).</p><p>Following the end of the primary analysis period, subjects and site personnel remained blinded to a subject's original treatment assignment.</p><p>These randomization and blinding methods are acceptable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Investigational Products, Dose and Mode of Administration</head><p>Romosozumab was supplied as a single-use 1 mL prefilled syringe (PFS) containing 70 mg of romosozumab per mL. During the 12-month double-blind alendronate-controlled study period, subjects received 3 SC prefilled syringe injections of romosozumab (i.e., 210 mg) or matched placebo at each dosing visit (i.e., day 1 study visit, and monthly study visits thereafter to month 11). Injections were administered by a healthcare professional into different sites on the subject's anterior abdominal wall, upper thigh, or upper arm.</p><p>The study protocol and the clinical study report specified that the active control alendronate was considered an investigational product; neither document specified whether the alendronate used in the study was US-approved. Blinded and open-label alendronate was "commercially manufactured and labeled." Therefore, specific alendronate dosing instructions (as detailed in marketed labeling) were to be provided to all subjects. Although the protocol and clinical study report (CSR) did not describe the specific alendronate dosing instructions, both the protocol and CSR did specifically state that alendronate labeling was to be followed when alendronate was dispensed. Placebo to alendronate was presented in identical containers. During the 12-month double-blind study period, subjects were dispensed a 2-month supply of alendronate or matched placebo on day 1 of the month 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 visits. One 70 mg tablet was self-administered orally by the subjects once each week. Following the 12month double-blind study period, subjects were dispensed a 6-month supply at the month 12 visit and every 6 months thereafter through the end of study. Subjects were asked to bring in all used and unused packages to study visits to assess compliance. The investigational site staff counted the number of returned tablets and captured this information on drug accountability forms and in the eCRF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dose Adjustments and Modifications</head><p>No dosing adjustments for romosozumab/placebo were permitted. Romosozumab/placebo could be administered +/-2 weeks of the target visit date; if the dose could not be administered +/-2 weeks of the target visit date, the dose was considered missed.</p><p>No dosing adjustments for alendronate/placebo or alendronate were permitted. If a subject missed a scheduled dose of the investigational product, the dose was to be taken as soon as possible as long as it was before the next scheduled dose. Dosing was to be resumed at the same dose (70 mg QW). Double or extra doses were not permitted.</p><p>NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} <ref type="bibr">6 6</ref> Other Protocol-required Therapies:</p><p>From screening to end-of-study, subjects were to receive daily calcium and vitamin D supplementation at a minimum of 500 to 1,000 mg elemental calcium and 600 to 800 IU vitamin D. In addition, subjects with a serum 25-hydroxy ( ng/mL and 40 ng/mL at screening received an initial loading dose of 50,000 to 60,000 IU vitamin D after randomization. Subjects with a serum 25 (OH) vitamin D level of &gt; 40 ng/mL at screening may have received the vitamin D loading dose at the principal investigator's discretion.</p><p>If a subject developed hypercalcemia or hypocalcemia during the study, the calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation could be adjusted to maintain serum calcium concentration within the normal range.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concomitant Therapy</head><p>Investigators were permitted to prescribe any concomitant medications or treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate care, except for those listed as excluded concomitant medications in the protocol (which included all medications known or suspected to affect bone metabolism). If a subject received any IV bisphosphonate therapy or oral bisphosphonate therapy equivalent to &gt; 1 month of therapy (except alendronate as study medication) while onstudy, investigational product was discontinued.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Assessments</head><p>Following the initial screening visit and the Day 1 visit, study visits occurred monthly during the 12-month double-blind period of the study. For the remainder of the study, visits occurred at Month 15, Month 18 and Month 24, and every 6 months thereafter (for subjects who were in the study for more than 24 months); phone contacts were performed during the months with no study visits (for continuous monthly monitoring of adverse events and concomitant medications).</p><p>Lateral spine X-rays were performed at screening, Month 12, Month 24 and at the end of study. DXA of the lumbar spine was performed on Day 1, Month 12, Month 24 and at the end of study. Serum laboratory assessments (including serum chemistry and hematology and antiromosozumab antibodies) were performed at most study visits. The detailed schedule of assessments is provided in the CSR <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">(Table 8-3)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fracture Analysis and Definitions</head><p>At baseline/screening, a single, central imaging center radiologist determined prevalent vertebral fractures on lateral-spine X-rays using the following Genant visual semiquantitative grading (SQ) scale: SQ grade 0 (SQ0) = no fracture SQ grade 1 (SQ1) = mild fract NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} 6 7 middle, or posterior) For assessment of incident vertebral fracture, x-rays were scored at the central imaging center blinded to treatment and using the SQ scale.

Clinical vertebral fractures were included regardless of trauma severity or pathologic fractures; nonvertebral fractures associated with high trauma severity or pathologic fractures were excluded. A single, central imaging center radiologist confirmed clinical fractures from either local radiology reports or from local radiographs sent to the central imaging center.</p><p>Nonvertebral fracture was defined as a fracture present on a copy of radiographs or other diagnostic images such as computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging confirming the fracture within 14 days of a reported fracture, excluding skull, facial, mandible, cervical vertebrae, thoracic vertebrae, lumbar vertebrae, metacarpus, finger phalanges, and toe phalanges.

Therefore, the Applicant's description of the clinical fracture endpoint as "subject incidence of clinical fracture through the primary analysis period" does not appear to be consistent with the analysis method, which describes the relation between the time to first clinical fracture incidence and treatment (adjusting for other potential covariates), with varying follow-up time as opposed to fixed follow-up time across subjects.

Currently the most widely used endpoint in clinical trials for new osteoporosis drugs is new morphometric (radiographically identified) vertebral fracture (which may or may not be symptomatic), which is the most common osteoporosis-related fracture in postmenopausal women <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Khosla, 2003)</ref>. Clinical fractures, which encompass all symptomatic fractures (i.e., nonvertebral fractures and vertebral fractures that are symptomatic and come to clinical attention), account for most of the morbidity and mortality associated with osteoporosis. Of note, for the clinical fracture endpoint, symptomatic vertebral fractures were included regardless of trauma severity or pathologic fractures. Historically, high-trauma fractures and pathologic fractures have been excluded in the assessment of fracture endpoints.</p><p>As discussed above in Section 2.1, nonvertebral fractures (the key secondary endpoint in this study) at virtually any site increase the risk of subsequent fracture and are associated with increased mortality.</p><p>There were multiple exploratory endpoints, including the following measuring PRO (patientreported outcomes) and ClinRO (clinician-reported outcomes):</p><p>PRO and ClinRO measures (Osteoporosis Assessment Questionnaire Short Version OPAQ SV , EQ-5D-5L EuroQoL-5 Dimensions-5 Levels Health Survey , Limited Activity LAD , and Brief Pain Inventory BPI worst pain) at months <ref type="bibr">6,12, 18, 24, 30, and 36</ref> Change from baseline in PRO and ClinRO measures (OPAQ SV, EQ-5D-5L, LAD, and BPI worst pain) at months <ref type="bibr">6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36</ref> Safety endpoints included the following (assessed during the 12-month double-blind alendronate-controlled study period and the primary analysis period):</p><p>Subject incidence of adverse events by system organ class and preferred term Changes from baseline in laboratory assessments (serum chemistry and hematology) and the shifts from baseline to the worst value Changes from baseline in vital signs Subject incidence of antiromosozumab antibodies NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} 7 0</p><p>These safety endpoints were adequate to assess general safety and the previously identified risks of romosozumab.

A physician was to be available during administration of investigational product, and all subjects were closely observed for approximately 30 minutes after dosing. The investigator was to be alerted if a subject experienced a BM study and was required to discuss implications for individual fracture risk, alternative treatment options, and options for continuing in the study with the subject. <ref type="bibr">Amendment 2 (November 14, 2012)</ref>:</p><p>Amended exclusion criteria to ensure that pre-existing disorders and/or the administration of medications did not confound the benefit/risk assessment for romosozumab. Amended proscribed treatments during the study to ensure those did not confound the benefit/risk assessment for romosozumab. Provided more detail on the adjudication of possible events of osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical femoral fractures, and cardiovascular events. Clarified that worsening vertebral fractures were considered for endpoints evaluating the incidence of all fractures. For endpoints evaluating the incidence of major osteoporotic fractures, corrected the definition to include forearm instead of wrist fractures. Baseline total hip BMD T-score was aligned with the Statistical Analysis Plan as an adjustment factor for the evaluation of new vertebral fracture incidence.

The protocol-mandated off-treatment times for exclusionary medications were revised. Rescreening was allowed for subjects who previously failed screening if in the opinion of the investigator the reason for the initial screen failure has resolved or was no longer applicable. Assessments for formation of antiromosozumab antibodies were added at the Month 1 and Month 3 study visits to allow a more comprehensive characterization of the antibody response. Retesting of serum calcium would be permitted within the screening window if the initial test indicated an elevated level of serum calcium within 1.1 x the upper limit of normal. <ref type="bibr">Amendment 4 (July 8, 2015)</ref> Upon completion of the primary analysis period, subjects were followed for nonvertebral fractures. Subjects and site personnel remained blinded to initial treatment assignments and the study proceeded in an event-driven manner. The final analysis (end-of-study) occurred when nonvertebral fracture events were confirmed for at least 440 subjects, or earlier if the primary analysis demonstrated superiority of romosozumab treatment for nonvertebral fracture risk reduction. The duration of participation for subjects was changed from 25 to 59 months if study completion was achieved at primary analysis, or from 37 to 71 months if study completion was achieved when 440 subjects experienced a nonvertebral fracture. Approximately 200 subjects were planned to be enrolled in the Imaging and PK/BTM/Biomarker Substudy, with a subset of approximately 100 subjects participating in the imaging (DXA, QCT) portion of the substudy. The exclusion criteria for hyper-/hypothyroidism and hyper-/hypoparathyroidism were clarified. The Month 15 study visit was eliminated for all but the substudy participants, and sampling for antibody testing was added to the Month 18 visit. The end of primary analysis and end-of-study visits were replaced by telephone contact. <ref type="bibr">Amendment 5 (September 14, 2016)</ref> Moved the following Month-12 exploratory endpoints to secondary endpoints: nonvertebral fracture, hip fracture, major osteoporotic fracture <ref type="bibr">(hip, forearm, humerus, and clinical vertebral</ref> The majority of these changes were made in response to FDA requests.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exposure:</head><p>In Study 142, the safety analyses included 2040 subjects in the romosozumab/alendronate group and 2014 subjects in the alendronate/alendronate group who received at least 1 dose of active investigational product. Of the 2046 subjects randomized to romosozumab in Study 142, 8 subjects did not receive investigational product during the 12month double blind period and were therefore not included in the safety analysis group, and 2 subjects were added to the romosozumab safety analysis set group (subjects who were randomized to alendronate but mistakenly received active doses of romosozumab). Of the 2047 subjects randomized to alendronate in Study 142, 33 did not qualify for the safety analysis set. Seven subjects did not receive the subcutaneous placebo injection and oral alendronate was not dispensed, while 3 subjects received subcutaneous placebo but were not dispensed oral alendronate. The 2 subjects who mistakenly received at least one active dose of romosozumab NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} 109 were moved to the romosozumab treatment group for safety outcomes. The remaining 21 subjects who did not qualify for inclusion in the safety analysis set received at least one dose of subcutaneous placebo given in the clinic, however, boxes for the dispensed drug were never returned, and therefore reconciliation was unable to confirm exposure.</p><p>During the 12-month double-blind period, the median number of double-blind SC injections of romosozumab or matching placebo received was 12 (range: 1 to 12) in both groups.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Cardiovascular Safety</head><p>This section discusses the concern regarding romosozumab's cardiovascular safety, a concern that was initially raised by the safety findings in Study 142. As mentioned in the previous section, the subject incidence rate of adjudicated positive cardiovascular serious adverse events (CV SAEs) in Study 142 alendronate group (38 subjects) during the 12-month double-blind period of the study. This alendronate group. An imbalance in DCRI positively-adjudicated CV SAEs was also observed in the small BMD study in men with osteoporosis (Study 174), with a higher incidence in romosozumab-treated subjects vs. placebo, with the imbalance also driven by events of myocardial infarction and stroke, although these event rates were very low limiting conclusions. An imbalance in positively-adjudicated CV SAEs was not observed between romosozumab and NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} 132 placebo in the placebo-controlled study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (Study 337).</p><p>Given the differences in cardiovascular safety results between the trials, it is unclear if the cardiovascular safety signal reflects a true increase in cardiovascular risk with romosozumab therapy. The three key studies were not specifically designed to assess cardiovascular safety outcomes. While there was a prespecified adjudication process for all serious cardiovascular adverse events, neither study assessed key measures associated with cardiovascular risk, such as fasting serum lipids, C-reactive protein levels and electrocardiograms. Therefore, it was not possible to assign a well-validated complete cardiovascular risk score (e.g., Framingham risk score) to study subjects, which would have enabled a more reliable characterization and interpretation of the pattern of events. Additionally, since cardiovascular events were not an expected outcome or a clear adverse event of interest, data regarding these events may not have been collected as rigorously as was necessary during the conduct of the studies to accurately capture all events. Rather, much of the analysis of cardiovascular safety data was done post-hoc after the imbalance in events in Study 142 was identified. Therefore, the reliability of the cardiovascular safety data may be limited. Another limitation of the studies is the uncertainty regarding the applicability of the cardiovascular findings to the US population and US medical practice. S study population of Study 337 was from the US, there is concern regarding the generalizability of the cardiovascular safety findings to the US population. Another limitation in the ability to interpret the observed imbalance in myocardial infarction and stroke events and assess romosozumab's cardiovascular risk derives from the overall low number of events of myocardial infarction and stroke observed in the studies. While the pivotal fracture studies were powered to assess fracture outcomes, they were not adequately powered to assess cardiovascular outcomes. Finally, the rate of study treatment group during the 12-month doublethe overall primary analysis period) raises additional uncertainty, as there may have been additional uncaptured cardiovascular events. Compared to Study 142, Study 337 had a similar discontinuation rate for the 12-month double-ach treatment group), and a lower rate for the overall 24-To further explore the cardiovascular safety signal and the divergent results in the subject incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke in the first year among the pivotal studies, the applicant performed a comprehensive evaluation of cardiovascular safety that included a second adjudication of the adverse events reported in the pivotal phase 3 studies (337, 142 and 174). Cardiovascular adverse events were evaluated with the following 3 methods:</p><p>1. Prespecified adjudication of potential CV SAEs in Studies 337, 142, and 174 by DCRI. This adjudication was added to the study protocols before the studies were initiated. This adjudication included all deaths, serious adverse events meeting prespecified "trigger" preferred terms, and additional serious adverse events identified by DCRI during review of triggered events. Investigators also had the option to flag potential CV SAEs for and 174 by the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Study Group to identify potential cardiovascular adverse events (full TIMI adjudication). Also performed was a readjudication by TIMI of all deaths and other serious adverse events previously adjudicated by DCRI, blinded to treatment and initial DCRI adjudication result. The triggering events and the requisite supporting documentation were the same as for the DRCI adjudication. 3. Analyses based on treatment-emergent adverse event reporting (to assure that the level of cardiovascular risk was not underestimated by the adjudication process). For adverse events reported on the eCRF that coded to standardized categories pertaining to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (i.e., treatment-emergent adverse event reporting), the subject incidence of adverse events was summarized using cardiovascular-related system organ class (SOC) and high level group term (HLGT) categories. As a more focused approach, narrow scope standardized MedDRA query (SMQ) and Amgen MedDRA query (AMQ) search strategies were used to summarize relevant event categories (e.g., myocardial infarction and stroke).</p><p>The applicant also performed additional nonclinical studies to evaluate biological plausibility that romosozumab might influence the rate of cardiovascular events.</p><p>The following sections provide an integrated summary of findings from the 3 pivotal studies that are relevant to the assessment of cardiovascular safety. These results are based on the final analyses of Studies 142, 337, and 174, which were the analyses presented in the Comprehensive Cardiovascular Report (CCR).</p></div>

Mean age was balanced between treatment groups within each study.</p><p>With respect to cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension), which are not necessarily indicative of a history of cardiovascular disease, the prevalences of hypercholesterolemia and diabetes were evenly distributed across studies and treatment groups. In line with the older mean age, the prevalence of hypertension was somewhat higher in 142 compared with the other 2 studies but was balanced between treatment groups. The prevalences of medical history specific to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (identified using MedDRA search strategies) were comparable between treatment groups in each of the pivotal phase 3 studies. In Studies 337 and 142, the use of cardiovascularrelated baseline medications (i.e., started on or before study day 1 and continued during the NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} 134 study) was similar between treatment groups within each study as well as among subjects with cardiovascular-related medical history.</p></div>

Positively-adjudicated cardiovascular death included cardiovascular death and death of undetermined cause. The CV SAEs were summarized for the 12-month doubleblind period and the overall study period for each study. In addition, a meta-analysis of the 3 pivotal, phase 3 studies was performed.</p><p>As discussed above, in Study 142 a higher subject incidence of CV SAEs was observed in the romosozumab group compared with the alendronate group during the double-blind treatment period, specifically for events of serious myocardial infarction and stroke <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">(Table 35</ref>). An imbalance in the subject incidence of positively adjudicated CV SAEs was also observed in Study 174 but event rates were very low, limiting conclusions. There was no imbalance observed in Study 337 during the double-blind treatment period.  For the meta-analysis of all 3 studies, the subject incidence of positively-adjudicated CV SAEs during the 12-month double-blind treatment period was slightly higher in the romosozumab group compared to  Although the prespecified endpoint for the DCRI adjudication was the subject incidence of positively-adjudicated CV SAEs, it is important to understand the risk in terms of the impact on the Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE) composite endpoint (comprised of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke), an endpoint that is commonly used to evaluate cardiovascular benefit or harm.</p><p>A post-hoc analysis of MACE was performed for the double-blind period and the overall study period for Studies 337, 142, and 174 individually.

However, a definitive conclusion regarding persistent risk following cessation of NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} 141 therapy cannot be made since the number of subjects at risk varied as the study progressed beyond Month 12 (due to the variability in follow-up duration for this event-driven trial).</p><p>Regarding the annual incidence rates of MACE in Study 142, the alendronate group had a low rate of cardiovascular events in the first year, with an increase in the rate of these events in subsequent years. The annual rates of events in subjects on open-label alendronate in years 2 and 3 were similar regardless of initial treatment group, and higher than what was observed in subjects on alendronate in year 1. During years 2 and 3 (i.e., during the open-label alendronate period), the annual incidences of MACE, regardless of treatment in the first year, ranged between the alendronate group in the first year was ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>). Of note, the annual incidence of MACE in the romosozumab group during the first year of the study was between the incidences observed for alendronate during years 2 and 3 in both study arms.</p><p>The reason for this pattern of MACE incidence rates by year is unclear. It may reflect chance findings, a higher risk with romosozumab or that alendronate may have had a short-term protective effect for cardiovascular outcomes. The FDA's exploratory network meta-analysis estimating the hazard ratio of alendronate vs. placebo was consistent with the possibility of the latter. The plausibility of such an effect is addressed below (under "Nonclinical and Human Genetic Data, Possible Explanations of Observed Imbalance, Epidemiology Reviews"). However, ultimately it is not possible to know the reason for these findings and we are left with the uncertainty that romosozumab may increase cardiovascular risk. Subgroup analyses in the individual studies and based on a meta-analysis of all 3 studies did not identify a population at consistently increased relative risk of a MACE with administration of romosozumab, including no difference in relative risk among subjects with and without a history of prior cardiovascular disease before randomization. Specific demographic characteristics, including age, geographic region, smoking history and history of risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and diabetes, were evaluated to determine if one or more specific subgroups of study subjects were at increased risk for developing an on-study MACE.</p><p>NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} 143 Point estimates for hazard ratios for subgroups based on geographic region were consistent with the hazard ratios of the overall population.</p><p>As expected, there was a consistently higher absolute risk of MACE for subjects with a history of cardiovascular risk factors in both Study 142 and Study 337. However, for subgroups of subjects with cardiovascular risk factors, including history of ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disorders as well as history of a cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event, the point estimates of the hazard ratios (romosozumab vs. alendronate) for the MACE composite endpoint through Month 12 within each of the subgroups were consistent with the hazard ratio of the overall population within each study, independent of whether the subgroup represented a higher or lower risk population.</p><p>Subgroup analysis was also performed by total cardiovascular risk score using a modified Raloxifene Use for the Heart (RUTH) criteria. Modified RUTH criteria are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 38</ref>. Modified RUTH scores ranged from 0 (indicating no cardiovascular risk) to 13 (indicating the highest cardiovascular risk). As expected, the absolute risk of MACE increased with increasing modified RUTH score. However, hazard ratios during the double-blind treatment period indicated that the relative risk of MACE was consistent over a range of modified RUTH scores NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} 144 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7)</ref>, and that there was no pattern of increasing hazard ratio with increasing modified RUTH score.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref> of CCR Additionally, in response to an information request during the review cycle, the applicant performed another post-hoc evaluation of cardiovascular risk via a modified Framingham Risk Score (FRS). The FRS required modification because the age of the enrolled romosozumab pivotal study population was higher (maximum age enrolled = 90 years) than the age range in which the FRS was validated, and fasting lipid levels were not collected in the pivotal studies of romosozumab. Assumptions for total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol, and extrapolation of the score for age were based on average values for age categories in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database for years 2007-2010. These data were supplemented with medical history and baseline medication data collected in the studies. If subjects reported events in their medical history indicative of hypercholesterolemia based on the narrow search of the hyperlipidemia SMQ or were taking a statin at baseline they were given the score for the higher category.</p><p>Analyses based on modified FRS scores were performed for the <ref type="bibr">12-month</ref>  Study 337 population. As expected, the subject incidence of MACE was higher in patients with higher modified FRS in both treatment groups in Studies 337, 142, and 174. However, there was no consistent modified FRS subgroup that demonstrated a higher relative risk for MACE on romosozumab. As with the modified RUTH score, there was no pattern of increasing hazard ratio with increasing modified FRS. The hazard ratio was actually lower for the modified FRS subgroup with highest risk (&gt; 2 risk) in Study 337 and 142.</p><p>The consistent hazard ratios for MACE across all geographic regions suggests that the findings are widely applicable throughout the world, and somewhat allays the concern that the cardiovascular safety findings may not be applicable to the US population (which had a very small representation in the studies as discussed previously).</p><p>Regarding the method for assigning cardiovascular risk, the applicant's use of the modified RUTH score was limited. It was not possible to estimate risk via the more widely utilized FRS, TIMI Risk Score, the Reynolds Score, or the ACC/AHA ASCVD Risk Estimator, as these require fasting lipid values, C-reactive protein (CRP) values and/or electrocardiograms, which were not performed in Studies 337 or 142. The modified RUTH score, although previously used in osteoporosis and breast cancer clinical trials to estimate cardiovascular risk, is not a widely utilized assessment of cardiovascular risk. Since the applicant imputed the hypercholesterolemia category as described above (rather than using actual measurement of serum lipid levels at baseline) to determine both the modified RUTH score and FRS scores, cardiovascular risk assessments with these scores may not be adequately predictive. However, the consistency of results for cardiovascular risk assessment and subgroup analysis using either the modified FRS or the modified RUTH score indicates that these scores likely still have some predictive value.</p></div>

At the applicant's request, DCRI retrospectively identified these events and the supporting documentation that was not available. Overall, adjudicated serious adverse events in Study 142, and no events in Study 174 were negatively adjudicated due to insufficient documentation. A sensitivity analysis was performed in which subjects with events that were negatively adjudicated due to insufficient documentation were considered positively adjudicated in the analyses. The number of subjects with CV SAEs that were negatively-adjudicated for insufficient documentation was generally balanced between treatment groups within each study through Month 12 and the overall study period. Therefore, considering these subjects as having positively-adjudicated CV SAEs in the analysis had no overall impact on hazard ratios <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">(Table 39</ref>).  <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 40</ref> shows the outcomes of treatment-emergent adverse event reporting side-by-side with the adjudication results for DCRI and the TIMI Study Group.

Myocardial infarction and stroke were identified by narrow search SMQ and AMQ, respectively, for treatment-emergent adverse event reporting, and by positively-adjudicated events for DCRI (based on serious adverse events) and the TIMI Study Group (based on all adverse events). The subject incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events of myocardial infarction and stroke were generally comparable to those of the adjudications. This provides assurance regarding the comprehensiveness of the adjudication process. committees (DCRI and TIMI). Interpretation and conclusions from Studies 337 and 174 remained unchanged following the TIMI adjudication process. In addition, incidences of CV SAEs were consistent between analyses based on treatment-emergent adverse event reporting and the adjudicated cardiovascular adverse events, providing further assurance regarding comprehensiveness and reliability of the adjudication process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DCRP Consultation</head><p>The Division of Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Products consulted the Division of Cardiovascular and Renal Products (DCRP) to request their assistance in reviewing the cardiovascular safety signal from the meta-analysis of the 3 pivotal studies, as well the adjudication process from the DRCI and the readjudication from the TIMI group. DCRP determined that both the DRCI and TIMI adjudication processes were adequate, and the required documentation was sufficient to render an adequate adjudication. DCRP also confirmed that the DCRI and TIMI adjudications yielded similar results. DCRP concluded that the overall hazard ratio for cardiovascular events from the meta-analysis was low but with an overall marginally significant hazard ratio for romosozumab vs. comparator. Refer to their written consult for further details regarding their analysis of the applicant's comprehensive cardiovascular safety assessment.</p><p>Nonclinical and Human Genetic Data, Possible Explanations of Observed Imbalance, Epidemiology Reviews</p><p>As discussed in the nonclinical section of this memorandum, the nonclinical data suggest that there is limited biological plausibility for a causal link between sclerostin inhibition and cardiovascular risk. Sclerostin is expressed in the aorta and in vascular and valvular calcification. However, its function in these sites is not known. Expression of sclerostin in vascular smooth muscle cells in foci of vascular mineralization in animals would be unlikely to explain the early imbalance in positively-adjudicated CV SAEs observed in Study 142. The timing of the observed events, with early separation between the alendronate and romosozumab arms within the first 3 months of treatment, is not consistent with a process involving vascular calcification. In addition, sclerostin inhibition did not appear to result in the initiation of vascular calcification or exacerbation of pre-existing medial calcification associated with aging or chronic kidney disease in animals, as shown by chronic toxicology evaluation in monkeys, a species that constitutively expresses sclerostin in the aorta, and in a lifetime study in rats, a species in which sclerostin is expressed in mineralizing foci.</p><p>In response to the cardiovascular safety findings observed in Study 142, the applicant performed additional nonclinical studies to explore plausible mechanisms that could account for an increased cardiovascular risk with romosozumab, including an in vitro human platelet activation study, an in vitro vasoconstriction study, a study that assessed sclerostin expression in atherosclerotic plaques, a study in the ApoE -/-mouse model of atherogenesis and a genome NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} 149 wide association study. For further details and discussion regarding these studies, refer to Section 5 of this review.</p><p>In patients with sclerosteosis or van Buchem disease, in whom sclerostin expression is absent or reduced due to a genetic mutation, there is no evidence of early onset vascular calcification or increased cardiovascular risk in the literature or through written communications with a scientific expert on the disease <ref type="bibr">(Beighton, 2011c;</ref><ref type="bibr">Beighton, 2011d)</ref>. The applicant included these communications in the BLA submission. Of note, these data are limited given the rarity of the disease and would not necessarily be able to detect a modest increase in cardiovascular risk if present.</p><p>Overall, the available nonclinical data do not definitively identify a mechanism to support biological plausibility for a causal relationship of romosozumab treatment with myocardial infarction or stroke. However, the finding of an increased incidence of necrotic aortic plaques in ApoE-/-mice (in Study 124609 as described in the nonclinical section of this memorandum) may be relevant, as recently available clinical data demonstrate that necrotic coronary plaques are at high risk of rupture, potentially leading to myocardial infarction <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Williams et al., 2019)</ref>. Relevant nonclinical data, however, are still limited, and the role of sclerostin in the cardiovascular system is currently not well understood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alendronate Cardioprotection</head><p>One possible explanation for the imbalance of serious cardiovascular events in Study 142 (other than a true increased risk with romosozumab) is that alendronate may have had an early cardioprotective effect on subjects in the alendronate treatment group. The FDA's exploratory network meta-analysis indirectly estimating the hazard ratio of MACE for alendronate vs. placebo (discussed above) was consistent with this as a possibility. There is also biologic plausibility to this theory, as bisphosphonates and statins (drugs used to treat hyperlipidemia and reduce the risk of ischemic cardiovascular events) both inhibit the mevalonate pathway (however, bisphosphonates have high specificity to bone and osteoclasts). To date, studies evaluating this theory of a cardioprotective effect of alendronate (and other bisphosphonates) have yielded mixed results. The alendronate controlled clinical fracture trials did not demonstrate a cardioprotective benefit.</p><p>A recent retrospective cohort study using a population-wide database managed by the Hong Kong Hospital Authority investigated the risk of cardiovascular events with and without alendronate in hip fracture patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Sing CW et al., 2018)</ref>. A total of 4594 patients treated with osteoporosis therapy were matched with 13,568 nontreated patients. Alendronate was associated with a significantly lower risk of 1-year cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio 0.33; cident myocardial infarction (hazard ratio 0.89), and a marginally significant reduction in risk of stroke at 5 years and 10 years (hazard ratio consistent in multiple sensitivity analyses. In contrast, a meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Kim DH et al., 2015)</ref> that estimated the risks of cardiovascular events (including total cardiovascular events, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death) in 58 randomized controlled trials of bisphosphonates in adults with low bone mass found that bisphosphonates do not appear to have beneficial or harmful effects on atherosclerotic cardiovascular events. Another meta-analysis <ref type="bibr">(Kranenberg G et al., 2016)</ref> reviewed 61 randomized controlled studies that reported the effects of bisphosphonates on arterial wall disease, cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality or all-cause mortality. There was no restriction for the type of population used in the studies. This meta-analysis found that bisphosphonates have no effect on arterial stiffness (based on 2 trials) or on cardiovascular events (based on 20 trials), but they did reduce arterial wall calcification (based on 2 trials), reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality (based on 10 trials) and reduce all-cause mortality (based on 48 trials) in various patient groups, including osteoporosis and cancer patients.</p><p>Although a cardioprotective effect of alendronate is a possibility, we cannot assume that the observed imbalance in cardiovascular events was due to this, as such a protective effect of bisphosphonates has not been established, and the available relevant data are not conclusive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background Rates of Myocardial infarction and Stroke</head><p>Another possible explanation for the imbalance observed in the two treatment arms is that the rates of observed events in each treatment group of Study 142 are within the expected variation range for cardiovascular events in the study population. To explore this possibility, the applicant conducted a targeted PubMed search for background rates of serious cardiovascular outcomes reported in population-based epidemiology studies of women and men aged 55-90 years. The applicant reviewed 10 population-based epidemiology studies (5 in osteoporosis patient populations, 5 in non-osteoporosis populations). The studies identified a background incidence rate estimate for myocardial infarction as 2-10 per 1,000 person-years (PYs) in the general population and 3-13 PYs in osteoporosis population, and for stroke 1-47 and 16-38 per 1,000 PYs, respectively. For comparison, in the 3 pivotal studies, the incidence rate of positively adjudicated myocardial infarction ranged from 3 to 8 per 1,000 PYs and the incidence rate of positively-adjudicated stroke ranged from 2 to 19 per 1,000 PYs in the romosozumab arm. In the alendronate arm, the corresponding rates were 3 and 4 per 1,000 PYs, respectively. In contrast, the incidence rates in the placebo group ranged from 0-2 and 3-13 per 1,000 PYs for MI and stroke, respectively.</p><p>Based on these findings, the applicant believes that the incidence rates of positively adjudicated myocardial infarction and stroke reported among subjects in the three phase 3 studies, including subjects receiving romosozumab, are within the ranges reported in population-based studies for similarly aged cohorts of women. Based on their literature review, DEPI concluded that 1) the background incidence rates of stroke and myocardial infarction vary substantially in the published literature. These substantially varied incidence rate estimates may be due to: 1) lack of validation for the case ascertainment algorithms used to identify CV SAE outcomes in administrative claims-based databases; 2) the selection of a high-risk study population (patients with a prior diagnosis of osteoporotic fracture) to derive the expected background rates; or 3) other confounding factors such as race, geographic locations, and baseline CV risk profiles which were inconsistent with the trial population. This heterogeneity may explain the wide range of the background rate estimates.</p><p>Despite the wider range of estimates derived from their literature search, DEPI, like the applicant, concluded that the incidence rates of myocardial infarction and stroke reported in the different treatment groups in Study 337 and Study 142 all fall within the expected background incidence rates in similarly aged osteoporosis populations. For full details regarding DEPI's literature search, results and analysis, refer to the consult entered in .</p><p>Given that the range of incidence rates of myocardial infarction and stroke reported in the literature is very wide, it is not surprising that the rates observed in the pivotal romosozumab studies fall within this range. Therefore, although it is somewhat reassuring that the rates observed in Study 142 do fall within the reported background ranges, we cannot conclude that this explains the observed imbalance of events, as we do not have a precise, established estimate of this range. Currently there is no definitive evidence to account for a mechanism by which romosozumab could lead to an increased risk of cardiac ischemic and cerebrovascular events. The only signal that may suggest potential biologic plausibility is the nonclinical finding of an increased incidence of necrotic aortic plaques in a mouse model of atherogenesis that was exposed to romosozumab (see the nonclinical section of this memorandum for details). Relevant nonclinical data, however, are still limited, and the role of sclerostin in the cardiovascular system is currently not well understood.</p><p>Although there currently is no definitive evidence to explain a mechanism by which romosozumab could increase the risk of cardiac ischemic and cerebrovascular events, there is also currently no evidence of an alternative cause or explanation for the observed imbalance in these events in Study 142. Therefore, we must consider that the imbalance in events of myocardial infarction and stroke observed in Study 142 and Study 174 may represent an increased risk of these events with romosozumab therapy and factor this potential risk into our benefit-risk assessment.</p><p>For all the reasons discussed above, it is not possible to definitively determine whether romosozumab increases cardiovascular risk, whether this is a chance finding or whether the findings reflect a cardioprotective effect of alendronate. Without definitive data resolving this uncertainty, we conclude at this time that romosozumab may increase cardiovascular risk. To ensure benefits outweigh the risks, romosozumab should be avoided in patients at high cardiovascular risk (e.g., those who have had a myocardial infarction or stroke within the preceding year).</p></div>

Subjects continued to receive romosozumab for an additional 12 months and then were randomized again within their initial treatment groups to receive placebo or denosumab for 12 months (study months 24-36). As depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref>, for subjects who received placebo after romosozumab 210 mg monthly (n=20), mean percent change from at month 36.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Issues</head><p>One potential statistical issue related to the co-primary endpoint of time to first clinical fractures in Study 142 was described in section 8.1.1. For time to first clinical fracture through the primary analysis period, with varied follow-up time for subjects, the pre-defined statistical analysis method was a Cox-proportional hazard model. Therefore, the Applicant's description of the clinical fracture endpoint as "subject incidence of clinical fracture through the primary analysis period", did not appear to be consistent with the analysis method. Hazard model analysis describes the relation between the fracture incidence and other potential covariates with varying follow-up time as opposed to fixed follow-up time and were appropriately labeled as risk reduction based on time to event analysis for the above endpoint. This statistical terminology issue does not impact the statistical analysis methods and results for the clinical fracture endpoint.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and Recommendations</head><p>The safety and efficacy of romosozumab for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture was evaluated in two large fracture efficacy trials, a placebo-controlled fracture trial 20070337 (study 337) and the active-controlled fracture trial 20110142 (study 142). These studies evaluated whether 12 months of treatment with romosozumab followed by continued therapy with an anti-resorptive agent provided fracture risk reduction in postmenopausal women.</p><p>NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} 157 Study 337 (N = 7180), reviewed in the first BLA cycle, was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study that assessed the efficacy and safety of romosozumab 210 mg administered subcutaneously (SC) every month (QM) for a duration of 12 months followed by denosumab 60 mg every 6 months for 12 months compared to 12 months of placebo followed by 12 months of denosumab in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. The study demonstrated a statistically significant reduction with romosozumab compared to placebo for both co-primary endpoints, which were 1) the subject incidence of new vertebral fractures at 12 months and 2) the subject incidence of new vertebral fractures at 24 months. During the 12-month double-blind period, the subject incidence of new vertebral fracture with te risk cebo followed by CI: 1.3, 2.5). and relative risk Clinical fracture (a composite of nonvertebral and clinical vertebral fractures) and nonvertebral fracture were secondary endpoints in study 337. At 12 reduction se clinical fractures were nonvertebral fractures and the risk reduction of nonvertebral fractures when considered alone did not meet statistical significance when adjusted for multiplicity. Study 337 was not adequately designed to assess romosozumab's efficacy for reduction in hip fractures.</p><p>Romosozumab also significantly increased BMD at all sites. At month 12, compared with and BMD at all sites at Month 24.</p><p>Study 142 (N = 4093) was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, alendronate-controlled study that assessed the efficacy and safety of romosozumab 210 mg SC monthly for a duration of 12 months followed by alendronate 70 mg weekly compared with alendronate 70 mg weekly alone in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis with a history of fracture. Compared with Study 337, Study 142 enrolled a population at higher risk of osteoporosis-related fracture. The coprimary endpoints were 1) the subject incidence of clinical fracture (nonvertebral and clinical vertebral fracture) through the primary analysis period and 2) the subject incidence of new vertebral fracture through Month 24. The primary analysis occurred after clinical fracture events had been confirmed for at least 330 subjects and all subjects had completed the Month 24 visit. At 24 months, the subject incidence of new vertebral fracture with romosozumab 62). At the end of the primary analysis period, the subject incidence of clinical fracture with with a median follow-up of 33 months. Romosozumab followed by alendronate significantly The safety of romosozumab is documented with approximately 5621 subjects exposed to romosozumab for one year in the two phase 3 fracture trials. In these two trials, a total of 105 deaths occurred during the double-blind 12-month study periods. The events were generally well balanced between the treatment groups with two exceptions. In trial 20070337, an group and 8 (0.2) subjects in the romosozumab group. This imbalance in deaths was predominantly due to malignant lung neoplasm, which occurred in no subjects in the placebo group and 4 subjects in the romosozumab group. All affected subjects were current or former smokers, the time to onset was short (47-132 days after first treatment of romosozumab), and the overall incidence of fatal and nonfatal lung neoplasms was balanced between treatment groups. In trial 20110142, an imbalance in deaths was noted for fatal cardiac disorders, which occurred in 3 --treated subjects. This cardiovascular safety finding along with the imbalance in adjudicated serious adverse cardiac events in study 142 is the predominant safety concern for romosozumab.</p><p>The outcomes of interest to evaluate cardiovascular risk were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) that occurred during the double-blind period of each trial. MACE was defined as a composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or nonfatal stroke, Cardiovascular death included deaths of undetermined cause. Across the two fracture experienced a major cardiac adverse event, yielding However, when each fracture trial is considered separately, the results diverge. In the placebocontrolled control group, 30 (0.8</p><p>Further evaluation of potential differences between the two fracture trials did not reveal an explanation for the differences in MACE outcomes. The participants in study 142 (74 years) were slightly older than those in study 337 (71 years) with slightly higher baseline positive the small number of events in both fracture trials, subgroup analyses based on demographic characteristics and osteoporosis characteristics were not informative. Because of the early separation of events between romosozumab and alendronate groups in the Kaplan Meier NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} 159 curve, further evaluation of romosozumab's effect on platelet aggregation, vasoconstriction, and blood pressure were assessed but did not reveal concerning findings in the limited data available. It is recognized that the sclerostin gene SOST mRNA is expressed in the heart, aorta, liver, and kidney. However, nonclinical and in vitro evaluations have not provided conclusive evidence regarding an association between sclerostin inhibition and adverse cardiovascular structural or functional effects. Therefore, cardiovascular adverse events remain a potential risk with romosozumab therapy.</p><p>Other safety risks for romosozumab identified in the clinical fracture trials include the following:</p><p>Injection Site Reactions: Across both fracture women in the romosozumab romosozumab group; 70 romosozumab group and control group). Injection site reactions resulted in discontinuation of treatment in 7 (0. group.</p><p>In the first review cycle, injection site reactions were evaluated based on antidrug antibody romosozumab treated subjects. When evaluated in terms of neutralizing antibody status, treated subjects.</p><p>The injection site reactions reported in the fracture trials occurred using a drug product concentration of 70 mg/mL where patients required 3 injections of 1mL each to reach the 210 mg dose. The to-be-marketed formulation of romosozumab will be the 90 mg/mL concentration, where patients will need two injections of 1.17mL each. In trial 20120156 comparing the 70 mg/mL and the 90 mg/mL formulations, injection site reactions occurred in mg/mL romosozumab group.</p><p>The potential for injection site reactions may be more pronounced with the higher concentration of romosozumab or in patients who develop binding antibodies to romosozumab.</p><p>Hypersensitivity: Like other monoclonal antibodies, romosozumab may be associated with hypersensitivity reactions. In study 337, hypersensitivity reactions were noted double-blind 12-month study period. In study 142, potential hypersensitivity reactions were NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} 160 romosozumab group during the 12-month double-blind period. Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions included angioedema, erythema multiforme, and urticaria. The potential for hypersensitivity reactions in the fracture trials are reported with use of romosozumab 70 mg/mL formulation. The to-be-marketed formulation of romosozumab will be the 90 mg/mL concentration, where patients will need two injections of 1.17mL each. Trial 20120156 was a 6-month trial that compared bone density changes of the romosozumab 70 mg/mL formulation and the romosozumab 90 mg/mL formulation. Potential hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 3</p><p>The potential for hypersensitivity reactions may be more pronounced with the higher concentration of romosozumab.</p><p>Hypocalcemia: Hypocalcemia has been reported with osteoporosis therapies that inhibit bone resorption. Romosozumab predominantly functions as a bone anabolic agent but also has some function as an antiresorptive agent. One proposed mechanism for the hypocalcemia is through the rapid bone mass accrual at initiation of treatment and an increased demand for bonemineralization substrates such as calcium. Based on earlier studies, the nadir in serum calcium appears to occur between 2 weeks and 1 month following romosozumab injection. However, in Studies 337 and 142 serum calcium was not assessed prior to Month 1. Therefore, it is possible that the nadir may have occurred prior to Month 1. In study 337, no serious adverse events of hypocalcemia were reported during the first year. One adverse event of Grade 2 hypocalcemia (albumin-corrected serum calcium 7.0 to 8.0 mg/dL) was reported in a romosozumab-treated subject. In study group. No hypocalcemia event was reported as serious. Mild and transitory decreases in albumin-corrected calcium and a compensatory increase in iPTH were observed after initiation of romosozumab. Based on the totality of data, the risk of hypocalcemia is manageable in all romosozumab-treated patients, with an additional safeguard of monitoring serum calcium in patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are at higher risk for hypocalcemia.</p><p>Osteonecrosis of Jaw (ONJ): Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a rare adverse reaction associated with potent antiresorptive medications. The applicant defined ONJ as an event of interest and all potential events of ONJ were submitted to an independent external adjudication committee for review and adjudication. In study 337, no placebo subjects and one romosozumab subject had a positively adjudicated case of ONJ during the 12-month double-blind period. One additional subject who had received romosozumab had positively adjudicated ONJ while undergoing denosumab therapy in the second year of the study. In study 142, no cases of ONJ occurred in the 12-month double-blind treatment period. In the second year of the trial when all subjects were on alendronate, two cases of ONJ occurred. One subject was in the alendronate alone group and the other subject was in the romosozumab then alendronate group.</p><p>While ONJ has been reported with potent antiresorptive agents such as denosumab and alendronate, the occurrence of ONJ with romosozumab therapy was not anticipated, given the NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} 161 predominant anabolic action of the product. The mechanism is unclear at this time and ONJ will continue to be followed closely.</p><p>Atypical Femur Fracture (AFF): Atypical femoral fracture is a rare adverse reaction associated with potent antiresorptive medications. The applicant defined atypical femoral fracture as an event of interest and all potential events of femoral fracture were submitted to an independent external adjudication committee. In study 337, no placebo subjects and one romosozumab subject had a positively adjudicated case of atypical femoral fracture. In study 142, no cases of atypical femoral fracture occurred in the 12-month double-blind treatment period. In the second year of the trial when all subjects were on alendronate, 6 cases of atypical femoral fracture were positively adjudicated (four in the alendronate alone group and 2 in the romosozumab then alendronate group). An additional subject from the romosozumab then alendronate group experienced an atypical femoral fracture after withdrawing from the study. She had received romosozumab for 12 months and alendronate for 2.5 years.</p><p>Similar to ONJ, the occurrence of atypical femoral fracture with romosozumab therapy was not anticipated. The mechanism is unclear at this time and atypical femoral fracture will continue to be followed closely.</p><p>Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone leading to an increase in fragility and fracture. The goal of osteoporosis therapy is to reduce the risk of fracture. The risk of fracture increases with age and a history of a prior osteoporosis-related fracture. In older patients, fracture, predominantly hip fracture, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Approximately 300,000 hip fractures occur each year in the US. Mortality in the year following hip fracture ranges from 10published reports and increases with age. While the romosozumab fracture studies were not designed adequately to assess hip fracture, a positive trend in hip fracture risk reduction was seen. Similarly, the occurrence of a cardiac ischemic event in postmenopausal women also confers the risk of considerable morbidity and mortality (with 1-year mortality estimates ranging from approximately 5--Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in women and cardiovascular risk increases after menopause.</p><p>When all data are considered, the benefits outweigh the risks for one year of romosozumab therapy in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are at high risk of fracture. Romosozumab reduces the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fracture. Although the fracture studies were not designed adequately to assess hip fracture, the outcome with the most associated morbidity and mortality, these studies did suggest a positive trend in risk reduction for hip fractures. Because of the different cardiovascular findings in the two large trials of romosozumab, the cardiovascular risk is considered a potential risk rather than a definitive risk. Given this potential risk, and the high risk of subsequent cardiac events in the year following a myocardial infarction or stroke, patients who are candidates for romosozumab therapy who have had a myocardial infarction or stroke within the prior year should not have romosozumab initiated, as outlined in product labeling. The review team recommends APPROVAL for romosozumab for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture; or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. Product labeling should include a boxed warning about the cardiovascular risk including the recommendation that patients with a history of stroke or myocardial infarction within the preceding year not receive romosozumab. Additionally, the review team recommends further evaluation of the cardiovascular signal post-approval as outlined below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Advisory Committee Meeting and Other External Consultations</head><p>An Advisory Committee meeting was held on January 16, 2019 to discuss the cardiovascular safety findings from the romosozumab fracture trials. The committee was asked to consider if the cardiovascular safety of romosozumab was adequately characterized or if additional safety data were needed.</p><p>The questions posed to the committee with a brief overview of the committee responses are outlined below:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion Question 1:</head><p>Discuss whether the cardiovascular safety of romosozumab has been adequately characterized. If additional safety data are needed, discuss the type(s) of data that are needed and whether these data should be obtained pre-approval or post-approval.</p><p>Committee Discussion: The committee members agreed that the cardiovascular safety profile of romosozumab was not adequately characterized. Committee members noted that it is unclear whether there is any increased cardiovascular risk with romosozumab, given the differences between the two trials (337 and 142). All members agreed that additional data are necessary to better characterize the potential cardiovascular risk. Most members agreed that a traditional observational study would not provide reliable data to draw conclusions regarding romosozumab's cardiovascular safety. This concern was based on the likely channeling of the use of the drug to patients with low cardiovascular risk given the Boxed Warning. Some members recommended a dedicated cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) to better characterize the risk. Most members recognized that a dedicated CVOT would provide the most reliable data, although some thought it would not be feasible because it would likely require many thousands of patients and take several years to complete. Some suggested that enriching the population with patients at higher cardiovascular risk would help to overcome this limitation. Proponents of a CVOT agreed that it would need to be active-controlled rather than placebo-controlled to ensure clinical equipoise in a population at high risk of fracture. Regarding the timing of an additional study examining cardiovascular safety, all but one member agreed that the study could be conducted post-approval.</p><p>NDA/BLA Multi-disciplinary Review and Evaluation {BLA 761062} {Evenity, romosozumab} 163</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion Question 2:</head><p>Amgen is seeking an indication for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.</p><p>Discuss whether the benefit/risk profile of romosozumab could be improved by further narrowing the indicated population to patients at low cardiovascular risk, and if so, how to define the narrowed population.</p><p>Committee Discussion: The committee members agreed that romosozumab treatment provides significant benefit in preventing the morbidity and mortality associated with osteoporosis. However, because of the uncertainties surrounding the cardiovascular risk of romosozumab, some members stated that it may be challenging for physicians and patients to weigh the benefits and risks on an individual basis. Additionally, the panel members noted that withholding the drug from anyone with a single cardiovascular disease risk factor may deny them a greatly needed benefit (e.g., prevention of potential morbidity and mortality associated with severe osteoporosis). Several committee members cited data showing that the risk of MACE is highest for patients who have had a myocardial infarction or stroke within the past year. Most members agreed that the best approach would be to warn against romosozumab use in this population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Voting Question:</head><p>Is the overall benefit/risk profile of romosozumab acceptable to support approval?</p><p>A. Yes, for Amgen's proposed indication (treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy) B. Yes, but for a different indication C. No Provide a rationale for your vote. If you voted for (b), describe the patient population in whom the benefits outweigh the risks. Committee Vote: A: 15 B: 3 C: 1 Committee Discussion: Most committee members voted "A" in support of approval of Amgen's proposed indication for romosozumab. These panel members agreed that romosozumab is clearly effective for treating severe osteoporosis, for which therapeutic options are limited, and that these benefits outweigh the identified and potential risks. However, members recommended that an additional study be conducted post-approval to better characterize romosozumab's potential cardiovascular risk. Additionally, there was wide support among members for including a boxed warning in the label against use in patients at highest risk for MACE (at least until more is known regarding romosozumab's cardiovascular risk). One of the members who voted "B" in support of a different indication had concerns about the potential safety signal and had suggested the need for a REMS or additional pre-approval data. The other member who voted "B" stated that the phrase "intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy" was too vague. The one member who voted "C" stated that there is not enough evidence to determine whether or not the benefits outweigh the risks.</p></div>

The iPSP was reviewed by the Pediatric Review Committee (PeRC) and PeRC concurred with the Applicant's plan for a full waiver.</p><p>During the first review cycle of this application, the applicant requested a full waiver from pediatric studies because the studies would be impossible given the lack of postmenopausal osteoporosis in the pediatric population.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12">Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS)</head><p>The Applicant did not propose a REMS for the marketing of romosozumab.</p><p>A REMS is not necessary to ensure the benefits outweigh the risks of romosozumab. Serious cardiovascular events of MI and stroke are an important potential risk; however, in the Agency's experience, REMS programs have minimal impact in mitigating the risk of MACE unless the REMS is designed specifically to limit who might receive the product. Such a REMS may not have the intended impact and is likely to require elements that would be burdensome to healthcare providers and patients. Therefore, as this product is efficacious and will be indicated for use in a higher risk population, a REMS is not necessary. Risk minimization will include communication of important risks for romosozumab through labeling including a boxed warning, limitations of use, and warning and precaution statements and a Medication Guide that alerts patients to the important risks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DCRP Summary and Assessment</head><p>The Applicant evaluated romosozumab for the treatment of osteoporosis in three clinical trials: 1) placebo controlled trial in osteoporotic women (study 20070337, N= 7157, 1:1 randomization); 2) alendronate-controlled trial in osteoporotic women (study 20110142, N=4054, 1:1 randomization); and 3) placebo-controlled trial in osteoporotic men (study 20110174, N= 244, 163 on romosozumab, and 81 on placebo). Each trial had a 12-month double blind period followed by an extension period. Study 20070337 had an extension of 12 additional months where subjects were treated with open label denosumab. Study 20110142 had a median extension of 24 months (median duration of study 36 months) where subjects were treated with open label alendronate until the requisite number of endpoints was achieved in this event-driven trial. Study 20110174 had an extension of an additional 3 months where the subjects were observed but not treated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2</head><p>The distribution of subject baseline characteristics (i.e., demographics, cardiovascular medical history, modified-RUTH cardiovascular risk score, cardiovascular medications) was similar between the romosozumab and controls arms for each study and between each study.</p><p>Cardiovascular adverse events were adjudicated by DCRI and by the TIMI group. The triggering events and the requisite supporting documentation were the same for both adjudication entities.</p><p>From a meta-analysis of the three trials, the incidence of events leading to death, myocardial infarction, or stroke in the 12-month double-blind period was low but with a marginally statistically significant hazard ratio (HR) against romosozumab that was consistent between the modes of adjudication: DCRI Adjudication: Incidence 1.3% vs 0.9%, HR 1.40 (95%CI 0.99-1.99); DCRI-matched TIMI Adjudication (TIMI adjudication of events previously adjudicated by DCRI): Incidence 1.2% vs 0.8%, HR 1.47 (95%CI 1.02-2.13); Full TIMI Adjudication: Incidence 1.2% vs 0.8%, HR 1.44 (95%CI 1.00-2.08). The results were driven by study 20110142. There was no imbalance in cardiovascular events in study 20070337. The HR results were driven by cardiac ischemic events (i.e., composite of myocardial infarction, angina requiring hospitalization, and coronary revascularization-either percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass surgery), myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events (stroke / TIA) during the 12-month double blind study period.</p><p>There was no imbalance of events in the overall study period, most likely due to termination of romosozumab after 12 months. One exception to the results in the overall study period was a marginally statistically significant HR for stroke both by DCRI and TIMI adjudications.</p><p>The results were not impacted by baseline cardiovascular risk as measured by the modified RUTH score.</p><p>In conclusion, DCRI and TIMI adjudications yielded similar results. Meta-analysis of cardiovascular events from the three osteoporosis trials showed a low incidence but an overall marginally significant HR for romosozumab vs comparator driven by one study. Assuming a positive benefit / risk evaluation of romosozumab, the cardiovascular risk based on these low numbers of events and marginally significant HRs can be described in the label.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Romosozumab (trade name Evenity) is a humanized monoclonal antibody against sclerostin and was developed for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. The therapeutic dosing regimen is 210 mg SC administered by a healthcare professional once each month. Sclerostin is a glycoprotein that inhibits osteoblast-mediated bone formation. By inhibiting sclerostin, romosozumab increases bone formation and decreases bone resorption.</p><p>The sclerostin gene mRNA is expressed in the heart, aorta, liver and kidney. In early development, the Applicant was concerned that inhibition of sclerostin may promote or exacerbate vascular calcification. The Applicant therefore convened an independent clinical endpoint committee (DCRI) to adjudicate reported cardiovascular serious adverse events 3 (SAEs) from the single pivotal trial (20070337) that supported the BLA for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.</p><p>Study 20070337 (FRAME) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (N= 7157). Study drug (romosozumab 210 mg SC q month or placebo) was administered for 12 months followed by open-label denosumab 60 mg SC q 6 months for an additional12-month period. The co-primary efficacy endpoints were the incidence of new vertebral fracture through month 12, and through month 24. This trial met the statutory requirements for substantial evidence of effectiveness and did not show a cardiovascular safety signal. The incidence of DCRI-positively adjudicated cardiovascular SAEs was similar between the treatment groups during the 12-month and the 24-month time periods <ref type="table" target="#tab_87">(Table 1</ref>). mg SC q month (n=163) or placebo (n=81) for 12 months and were followed for an additional 3 months after completion of the double-blind period for evaluation of safety and immunogenicity. The primary efficacy endpoint was percent change from baseline in dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) bone marrow density (BMD) at the lumbar spine at month 12. There was no follow-on therapy. First-patient-enrolled was 16 June 2014; the cut-off date was 27 January 2016. The study report was finalized on 21 July 2016.</p><p>The results of studies 20110142 and 20110174 demonstrated statistically significant effectiveness of romosozumab for each study's primary efficacy endpoint. However, there was a higher incidence of the DCRI-positively adjudicated cardiovascular SAEs during the first year in the romosozumab arm over the alendronate arm in study 20110142 and in the romosozumab arm over the placebo arm in study 20110174, although the latter study was too small to draw a credible conclusion <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 2</ref>). DBRUP consulted DCRP on 21 September 2017 to attend post-CR meetings with the Applicant pursuant to reconciliation strategies regarding the cardiovascular safety signal. The Applicant met with DBRUP and consulting staff from DCRP on 26 October 2017 to discuss plans to evaluate cardiovascular SAEs. Plans to re-engage DCRI and simultaneously hire the TIMI group were discussed as stated in the Meeting Minutes dated 22 Nov 2017. Advice from DCRP that were documented in the Minutes included: 1) submission of adjudication packages; 2) incorporation of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter as a baseline risk factor; 3) evaluation of the percentage of events originally adjudicated as negative because of missing data; 4) itemization of cardiovascular events by individual study; 5) specification of particular documentation missing; 6) compilation of a list of cases adjudicated as negative because of missing data; 7) disclosure of adjudication decisions by each reviewer from the TIMI committee; and 8) prespecification of the standardized MedDRA queries and trigger terms used by TIMI to identify additional events.</p><p>Based on the original DCRI adjudication process, an event in which insufficient information was provided yielded a negative adjudication (i.e., the event was not a cardiovascular SAE). The 6 original DCRI adjudication process also focused on SAEs. DCRI was requested to perform a retrospective re-review of all negatively adjudicated events in the three studies to determine if the original negative adjudication result was due to a site reported event with adequate source documentation not meeting the endpoint definition, or if the original negative adjudication result was due to a lack of recommended source documentation, and if so, what specific missing documentation resulted in the negative decision. Based on the DCRI adjudication charter, final adjudication decisions undergoing re-review would not be modified as there would be no changes to adjudication results. The re-review effort would be considered a source documentation adequacy review.</p><p>The TIMI study group was also requested to perform a posthoc adjudication of the cardiovascular adverse events in the three studies to assure that 1) relevant events had not been missed and that 2) the focus on SAEs in the prespecified adjudication by DCRI was not overly narrow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adjudication Processes</head><p>DCRI and TIMI adjudicated major adverse cardiac events (MACE) defined as cardiovascular adverse events leading to death, positively adjudicated myocardial infarction, and positively adjudicated stroke. The analysis of MACE was performed for the double-blind period and overall study period for studies 20070337 (12-month double blind, 24 months overall study period), 20110142 (12 months double blind, median 36 months overall study period), and 20110174 (12 months double blind, 15 months overall study period).</p><p>TIMI did not submit a written adjudication report because, as explained by the Applicant, TIMI's role was to confirm the DCRI adjudication results. The TIMI adjudication process and results, as well as those from DCRI, were reported by the Applicant in their Comprehensive Cardiovascular Report that included the DCRI and TIMI charters.</p><p>DCRI and TIMI independent adjudication processes are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The key distinctions between the adjudication processes were: 1) The TIMI group adjudicated all adverse events (serious and non-serious) meeting the triggers for adjudication; and 2) The TIMI group adjudicated an event as either positive, negative, or suspected (i.e., insufficient information was not categorically assigned a negative adjudication).</p><p>Events triggering adjudication for both the DCRI and TIMI processes are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table  3</ref>. The specific triggers included death (all events), cerebrovascular events, cardiac ischemic events, heart failure, non-coronary revascularization, and peripheral vascular events not needing revascularization. These triggers were the same for both adjudication processes. However, the DCRI trigger for heart failure required hospitalization whereas hospitalization was not explicitly stated as a requirement for heart failure adjudication in the TIMI process. The required source documentation to support the adjudications for each trigger was similar for both adjudication processes <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table 4</ref>).</p><p>Reviewer Assessment: The adjudication processes were adequate, and the required documentation was sufficient to render an adequate adjudication.   </p></div>

The mean ages ranged from 71 to 74 years. Approximately 26%-29% of the subjects in the two large trials in osteoporotic women (20070337 and 20110142) were smokers (current or former), and 50-63% of the subjects in the small trial of osteoporotic men (20110174) were current/former smokers. Most of the subjects in all three trials had an estimated glomerular filtration Incidence between 60-90 mL/min/1.73m 2 .</p><p>Approximately 75% of the subjects in the romosozumab program had a cardiovascular-related disease. The cardiovascular medical histories were generally similar between the arms of each trial and between each trial, including cardiac risk as determined by the modified RUTH score ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_92">Table 6</ref>).</p><p>The modified RUTH score was used by the Applicant in this analysis <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">(Table 7)</ref> and was developed to assess cardiovascular risk in women enrolled in the Raloxifene Use for The Heart (RUTH) study <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Mosca, 2001)</ref>. Women with &gt; 4 risk points were at increased risk for cardiovascular events. Women with &lt; 4 risk points were of low cardiovascular risk as assessed in the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation (MORE) trial as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">Figure 2</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Keech, 2005)</ref>. The MORE dataset (N = 5133) showed an approximate overall 2% incidence of coronary events and an approximate overall 2% incidence of cerebrovascular events in the placebo arm (n=2576); and an approximate overall 2% incidence of coronary events and approximate overall 1% incidence of cerebrovascular events in the Raloxifene arm (n=2557). Those subjects classified as low risk (n=4457, mean risk score 1.6 + 1.0) had an approximate 1% incidence of coronary events and an approximate 1% incidence of cerebrovascular events in both the placebo arm (n=2259) and in the Raloxifene arm (n=2198), respectively. Those subjects classified as high risk (n=676, mean risk score 5.0 + 1.7) had an approximate 7% incidence of coronary events and an approximate 6% incidence of cerebrovascular events in the placebo arm (n=317); and an approximate 5% incidence of coronary events and an approximate 3% incidence of cerebrovascular events in the Raloxifene arm (n=359).</p><p>Approximately 60% of the subjects in the intention-to-treat population of the romosozumab program were taking at least one cardiovascular-related medication (e.g., aspirin, antiplatelet, beta-blocker, anticoagulant, angiotensin-II receptor blocker, ACE-inhibitors, statins). Approximately 20-38% of the subjects were on a specific medication ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 8</ref>). In subjects who had a cardiovascular related condition at baseline, the prevalence of baseline cardiovascular medications was higher: approximately 75% were on at least one cardiovascular medication with 22-50% taking specific medications ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 9</ref>). The use of cardiovascular-related baseline concomitant medications was generally evenly distributed between the arms of each trial as well as between each trial.      </p></div>

Of the negatively adjudicated events, 400 had sufficient information but did not meet the criteria for an event, and 53 were adjudicated as negative due to insufficient information. The missing information was associated with cardiac ischemic, heart failure, peripheral vascular and cerebrovascular events and was mostly discharge summaries, medical records, hospital records, imaging, ECGs, and additional information not provided due to subject withdrawal of consent .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit-Risk Summary and Assessment</head><p>Romosozumab (proposed trade name Evenity) is a first-in-class sclerostin inhibitor proposed as a one-year treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis to reduce the risk of fracture. The dosing regimen is 210 mg administered subcutaneously once monthly in the arm, abdominal wall or thigh by a health care provider. Two back-to-back injections are needed to administer the full dose.</p><p>Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by low bone mass, compromised bone strength, and an increased risk of fracture. While osteoporosis can occur in both men and women, studies in postmenopausal women provide most of the data defining the disease and its sequelae. The goal of treatment is to reduce the risk of fracture.</p><p>The efficacy of romosozumab was evaluated in a clinical trial of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who were receiving calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Fracture outcomes were assessed after patients received one year of treatment with romosozumab or placebo, and again after patients had subsequently received a year of treatment with denosumab.</p><p> One year of treatment with romosozumab significantly reduced the risk of new vertebral fractures compared to placebo. The incidence of new vertebral fractures was 0.5% with romosozumab and 1.8% with placebo (p&lt;0.001). The absolute risk reduction was 1.3% (95% confidence interval 0.8%-1.8%) and the relative risk reduction was 73% (95% confidence interval 53%-84%). Based on the bounds of the 95% confidence interval for the absolute risk reduction, the number needed to treat to prevent one new vertebral fracture is 56-125.</p><p> One year of romosozumab followed by one year of denosumab significantly reduced the risk of new vertebral fractures compared to one year of placebo followed by one year of denosumab. The incidence of new vertebral fractures was 0.6% with romosozumab then denosumab and 2.5% with placebo then denosumab (p&lt;0.001). The absolute risk reduction was 1.9% (95% confidence interval 1.3%-2.5%) and the relative risk reduction was 75% (95% confidence interval 60%-84%).</p><p>The robust and statistically persuasive findings (p&lt;0.001) from this single fracture outcomes trial together with supportive bone mineral density data from two dose-finding trials meet the requirement for substantial evidence of effectiveness.</p><p>Romosozumab did not significantly reduce the risk of nonvertebral fractures, likely because the trial was underpowered for these events.</p><p>Based on the observation that patients previously treated with romosozumab experienced large losses of their accrued bone mineral density</p><p>Reference ID: 4124009 after switching to placebo for one year, the beneficial effect of romosozumab on vertebral fractures is expected to wane within one year after stopping romosozumab if another osteoporosis therapy is not initiated. The application provides evidence of fracture risk reduction beyond the one year of treatment with romosozumab only for patients who subsequently received one year of treatment with denosumab.</p><p>Only 3% of the pivotal Phase 3 trial population was from North America. There were too few patients to statistically analyze fracture outcomes in this subgroup. However, the bone mineral density increases among North Americans were consistent with those for the overall trial population. These data support generalizability of the foreign data to patients in the United States.</p><p>Treatment with romosozumab for one year did not appear to have adverse cardiovascular effects compared to placebo. In contrast, topline results from an ongoing trial that became available late in the review cycle showed adverse cardiovascular effects with romosozumab compared to alendronate (an approved osteoporosis therapy). Adverse cardiovascular effects were also seen in a recently completed, small male osteoporosis trial. Reasons for the discrepant results are unclear. The hazard ratios for Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE), a composite endpoint of adjudicated serious adverse events of myocardial infarction and stroke, and cardiovascular death were:  1.03 (95% confidence interval 0.62, 1.72) in the pivotal Phase 3 trial included in the application  1.87 (95% confidence interval <ref type="bibr">1.11, 3.14)</ref> in the alendronate trial  1.55 (95% confidence interval 0.31, 7.69) in the male osteoporosis trial Romosozumab's remaining safety concerns are generally infrequent and have been seen with other therapeutic biologics or with some of the other approved osteoporosis therapies. These safety concerns include:  Hypersensitivity reactions, which were reported as serious in 0.2% of patients  Injection site reactions (e.g., pain and erythema), which were reported in 5-10% of patients, but rarely led to treatment discontinuation  Hypocalcemia, which was reported in less than 0.5% of patients. Those with renal impairment, particularly end-stage renal disease, appear to be particularly susceptible to hypocalcemia with romosozumab.  Osteonecrosis of the jaw, which was reported in three patients, one currently and two previously treated with romosozumab  Atypical femoral fracture, which was reported in two patients, one currently and one previously treated with romosozumab About 19% of patients treated with the 210 mg romosozumab dose developed binding antibodies. About 4% of those with binding antibodies tested positive for neutralizing antibodies. The incidence of injection site reactions was slightly higher among patients with antibodies. There were no other apparent effects of antibodies on safety. Antibodies decreased romosozumab exposures by up to 25%. However, romosozumab concentrations among patients with binding antibodies were all within the range of concentrations observed in patients without binding antibodies. In general, the presence of antibodies had no apparent effect on efficacy, although it is possible that some patients may have reduced efficacy as evidenced by a romosozumab-treated patient who developed neutralizing antibodies then had persistently undetectable romosozumab concentrations despite continued dosing.</p><p>The new data showing potential cardiovascular risk are preliminary. A full report of these data and the fracture outcomes data from the head-tohead comparison of romosozumab to alendronate are needed to determine whether there is a population for whom the benefits of romosozumab outweigh its risks, and whether risk minimization strategies beyond labeling are needed to ensure the benefits outweigh the risks. The remaining safety concerns can be adequately mitigated by labeling, including a Medication Guide.</p><p>In summary, the Division cannot determine whether the benefits of romosozumab outweigh the identified risks and uncertainties until we have completed a thorough review of the cardiovascular safety of romosozumab and its comparative efficacy from the alendronate-controlled trial. These data should be included in the resubmission.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background</head><p>Amgen submitted this Biologics License Application (BLA) for romosozumab (trade name Evenity), a first-in-class sclerostin inhibitor proposed for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Romosozumab is not approved in any country. The proposed dosing regimen is 210 mg (given as two back-to-back injections of 105 mg) administered subcutaneously by a healthcare provider in the patient's arm, abdominal wall or thigh once monthly for 12 months.</p><p>Sclerostin, a glycoprotein produced by osteocytes, inhibits the Wingless-related integration site (Wnt) signaling pathway, leading to reduced bone formation and increased bone resorption.</p><p>Patients with the rare bone disorder, sclerosteosis, have an inactivating mutation in the sclerostin gene that leads to a lack of sclerostin, and have dense bones that are resistant to fracture. Patients with Van Buchem disease lack a regulatory element of the sclerostin gene, leading to reduced sclerostin concentrations and a resistance to fractures. Based on these effects, the Applicant developed romosozumab, a humanized immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) monoclonal antibody, that binds and inhibits sclerostin to reduce the risk of fractures in patients with osteoporosis.</p><p>This BLA was reviewed under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) V "Program" because it contains a new molecular entity and was received after October 1, 2012. This document summarizes the Division's recommendations on the application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Product Quality</head><p>The Office of Pharmaceutical Quality and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health recommend approval. See their reviews for details.</p><p>Evenity is a drug-device combination product containing romosozumab in a sterile, preservativefree solution within a single-use syringe. The syringe includes a needle. Each syringe delivers a volume of 1.17 mL containing 105 mg of romosozumab in a concentration of 90 mg/mL. Inactive ingredients include calcium, acetate, sucrose, polysorbate 20, sodium hydroxide and Water for Injection -none of which are novel. A syringe delivers one-half of the required dose; therefore, two back-to-back injections using two separate syringes are needed to deliver the full dose.</p><p>Romosozumab is produced from a recombinant DNA-derived Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line using standard cell culture techniques. The Applicant provided adequate data to ensure that the product is pure and potent, and has acceptable manufacturing processes. All required pre-licensing manufacturing inspections were acceptable.</p><p>If romosozumab can be approved, the Chemistry reviewers recommend a postmarketing commitment 9</p><p>The Office of Pharmaceutical Quality also assessed the Applicant's assays for detecting binding and neutralizing antibodies to romosozumab. The reviewers found the assays to be adequate. Of note, the presence of romosozumab can interfere with the neutralizing assay, preventing detection of low concentrations of neutralizing antibodies. The Applicant handled this issue by including an assessment of neutralizing antibodies four months after the last dose of romosozumab in the Phase 2 and 3 trials.</p><p>The stability data support a shelf-life of 36 months for the drug product when stored at 2-8 degrees Celsius.</p><p>The Center for Devices and Radiological Health reviewed the syringe component and concluded that it is suitable for the intended use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Nonclinical Pharmacology/Toxicology</head><p>The Nonclinical Pharmacology/Toxicology reviewers recommend approval. See their review for details.</p><p>Romosozumab binds with similar affinity to human, rat and monkey sclerostin. Anti-drug antibodies developed in some rats and monkeys, lowering exposures. These animals were removed from the longer-term nonclinical studies or removed from data analyses involving pharmacokinetic evaluations. Romosozumab was highly immunogenic in rabbits so this species was not used for toxicity assessments.</p><p>The drug substance formulation used in the nonclinical studies was either identical to that used for the Phase 3 trial or adequately bridged to the Phase 3 formulation via a monkey pharmacokinetic study.</p><p>In ovariectomized rats and monkeys (animal models of postmenopausal osteoporosis), romosozumab increased bone mass and bone strength without negatively affecting bone quality.</p><p>The Applicant conducted toxicology studies up to six months duration in rats and monkeys. The reviewers attribute the main findings in these studies to the pharmacologic effect of romosozumab. For example, decreases in red blood cells, leukocytes, and platelets, and extramedullary hematopoiesis were associated with hyperostosis (excessive bone growth), and attributed to the narrowing of the hematopoietic bone marrow space. There were also decreases in serum calcium and phosphorus (attributed to use of these minerals for new bone formation). Multiples of human exposure ranged from 1 to 38-fold in rats and 1 to 93-fold in monkeys.</p><p>As discussed in the Safety Section and Benefit/Risk Assessment, the Applicant has identified a cardiovascular safety signal in an ongoing active-controlled Phase 3 trial and in a small trial in men, which was not observed in the Phase 3 trial included in the BLA. The sclerostin gene or protein is expressed in portions of the vasculature (the aorta, pulmonary artery, and calcified vascular smooth muscle cells). However, there were no adverse findings from the nonclinical program that lend support to the cardiovascular findings observed in the clinical trials. Specifically, there were no electrocardiographic effects in the one-month and six-month monkey 10 toxicity studies, no cardiac or vascular histopathologic findings in rats or monkeys, no radiographic evidence of vascular calcification in a 12-month monkey bone study, and no effect on the incidence of vascular calcification in a two-year rat study.</p><p>The Applicant did not assess mutagenicity because monoclonal antibodies are not expected to alter DNA or chromosomes. We recommended a rodent carcinogenicity study because of the potential for romosozumab to activate Wnt signaling, because this pathway may be involved in tumorigenesis. The 98-week carcinogenicity study in rats did not show any drug-related tumors. Two cases of osteosarcoma were seen in males in the high-dose group (19-times human exposure) that were not statistically different to control. The reviewers concluded that romosozumab is unlikely to increase the human risk of osteosarcoma.</p><p>Findings from the reproductive toxicity studies in rats included:</p><p> No effects on fertility in rats given romosozumab at 1.5 to 56-times human exposure.</p><p> Reduced ventral processes of the sixth cervical vertebra at 17 to 56-times human exposure. This finding represents a developmental delay but the reviewers do not consider it to be relevant because this anatomical structure is not present in humans.</p><p> Poly-and syndactyly at 32-times human exposure. This finding is consistent with the syndactyly seen in humans who have homozygous sclerosteosis, and in mice that have a knockout of the sclerostin gene. The reviewers consider this finding to have low clinical relevance based on the exposure multiple, and timing of digit formation in the first trimester in humans when placental transfer of immunoglobulins is limited.</p><p> Mild decreases in bone mass and size in the offspring of female rats that had been given romosozumab doses at 1.5 to 56-times human exposure.</p><p>Note that the Applicant is seeking approval in postmenopausal women, a population that is no longer of reproductive potential.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Clinical Pharmacology</head><p>The Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics reviewers recommend approval. See their review for details. Key findings are summarized below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selected pharmacokinetic parameters:</head><p>Romosozumab has nonlinear pharmacokinetics, with a greater than dose-proportional increase in exposure. For example, there is a 550-fold increase in mean area under the concentration-time curve (AUC inf ) with a 100-fold increase in subcutaneous dosing from 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg (the proposed dose of 210 mg corresponds to 3 mg/kg for a 70 kg women).</p><p>After a single 210 mg dose to healthy subjects, the median time to maximal concentrations (Tmax) was five days (range 2-7 days) with a Cmax of 22 mcg/mL. In the pivotal Phase 3 trial, steady state was achieved by Month 3 following once monthly dosing. At steady state, trough serum concentrations of romosozumab ranged from 8-10 mcg/mL in pre-dose samples, and the effective half-life was about 13 days.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intrinsic and extrinsic factors:</head><p>The Applicant tested a single romosozumab dose in the pivotal Phase 3 trial. The Clinical Pharmacology reviewers are not recommending dose adjustments based on intrinsic factors (e.g., age, body weight, renal impairment) or extrinsic factors (e.g., drug interactions), as summarized below.</p><p> In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study, patients with severe renal impairment had a 29% mean increase in romosozumab Cmax and a 44% mean increase in romosozumab AUC compared to healthy subjects (smaller increases are expected in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment). These modest pharmacokinetic differences do not necessitate dosage adjustment. In contrast, mean romosozumab exposures were similar between patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis and healthy subjects. The reason for the discrepancy between those with severe renal impairment and end-stage renal disease is unclear.</p><p> Population pharmacokinetic modeling did not identify an impact of age on romosozumab exposures but noted an increase in romosozumab exposures among patients with lower body weight. Romosozumab AUC among patients in the lowest quartile of body weight was about 50% higher than in the highest quartile of body weight. These data are consistent with the bone mineral density changes seen with romosozumab in the pivotal Phase 3 trial, where percent increases at the lumbar spine were progressively smaller with increasing quartile of body weight. For example, the median increase at one year was 14.8% in the lowest quartile of body weight compared to 10.8% in the highest quartile. However, the highest quartile still had large increases in bone mineral density and had a numerically lower incidence of new vertebral fractures compared to the lowest quartile. There was also no statistical interaction between treatment and body mass index with respect to new vertebral fractures. In totality, based on these data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial, which administered the same dose to all patients regardless of body weight, there is no need for dosage adjustment based on body weight.</p><p> The Applicant did not assess romosozumab exposures in patients with hepatic impairment, characterize the metabolic pathway of romosozumab, or conduct drug-drug interaction studies. This is reasonable because, unlike small molecule drugs which are often metabolized by hepatic enzymes, large therapeutic antibodies are typically degraded into amino acids by ubiquitous proteases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dose-finding:</head><p>The Phase 2 dose-finding trial (20060326) in postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density included two active-comparator arms, and an extension and retreatment phase. For dose-selection for Phase 3, the Applicant focused on the initial two year treatment period and comparisons between placebo and the five tested subcutaneous romosozumab doses (70 mg monthly, 140 mg monthly, 210 mg monthly, 140 mg every three months, 210 mg every three months). There were dose-dependent increases in bone mineral density during the first year of treatment, with more gradual increases during the second year.</p><p>During the first year of treatment with romosozumab, bone turnover markers showed an increase in bone formation and a reduction in bone resorption. During the second year, the bone turnover markers showed persistent effects on bone resorption but not on bone formation.</p><p>Based on the bone mineral density data and bone turnover markers, the Applicant proposed to treat patients with romosozumab for only one year. They chose the 210 mg monthly dose for Phase 3 testing because this dose had the greatest effect on bone mineral density and bone formation markers during one year of treatment.</p><p>After the two year treatment period, patients were re-randomized to one year of denosumab or placebo. After treatment with placebo for one year, patients previously treated with romosozumab had experienced large losses of their accrued bone mineral density. These data provide an opportunity to assess what happens to bone mineral density when romosozumab is stopped without initiation of other osteoporosis therapy, and support the need for continued osteoporosis therapy after romosozumab is stopped.</p><p>Another dose-finding Phase 2 trial (20101291) was conducted in postmenopausal Japanese women with osteoporosis. This one year trial compared three romosozumab doses (70 mg, 140 mg, or 210 mg once monthly) to placebo. Findings were consistent with the other dose-finding trial, with the greatest bone mineral density gains at the lumbar spine with the 210 mg monthly dose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bone turnover markers:</head><p>In the pivotal Phase 3 trial, the bone formation marker, type 1 Nterminal procollagen (P1NP), peaked two weeks after starting romosozumab but declined to concentrations seen with placebo at Month 9 and further declined to concentrations about 15% below placebo at Month 12. The bone resorption marker collagen type 1 C-telopeptide (CTX), nadired two weeks after starting romosozumab and remained about 25% below placebo at Month 12. These data like those from the Phase 2 dose-finding trial, support two mechanisms of action -increased bone formation (that is transient, lasting less than a year) and reduced bone resorption (that persists after one year of treatment).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formulation changes:</head><p>In the dose-finding Phase 2 trial (20060326) and the pivotal Phase 3 trial <ref type="formula" target="#formula_34">(20070337)</ref>, investigators administered the 70 mg/mL formulation of romosozumab. The full 210 mg dose was given as three back-to-back 1.0 mL injections. In contrast, the to-be-marketed product uses single-use prefilled syringes containing 90 mg/mL of romosozumab. Health care providers will administer the 210 mg dose as two 1.17 mL injections, with each injection providing 105 mg of romosozumab. The Applicant adequately bridged the differences between the Phase 3 and to-be-marketed products with the following approach:</p><p> A clinical pharmacology study and a separate six-month bone mineral density non-inferiority trial compared the 210 mg romosozumab dose given in the 70 mg/mL formulation to the 90 mg/mL formulation. Both formulations in these bridging trials used the Phase 3 drug substance manufacturing site. We had recommended the non-inferiority trial because formulation changes of complex protein products, such as romosozumab, could potentially</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Reference ID: 4124009 (b) (4)</formula><p>impact immunogenicity, which could in turn affect the efficacy or safety profile. This noninferiority trial is discussed in more detail in the Efficacy and Safety sections.</p><p> Another clinical pharmacology study compared the pharmacokinetic profile of the 210 mg romosozumab dose given in the 90 mg/mL formulation produced at the Phase 3 drug substance manufacturing site to the 90 mg/mL formulation produced at the to-be-marketed drug substance manufacturing site.</p><p> Lastly, the Office of Pharmaceutical Quality determined that comparative analytical data, including lot release testing, additional characterization, and stability studies were sufficient to bridge the change in the commercial manufacturing site for the drug product.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunogenicity:</head><p>One subject in the first-in-human study developed neutralizing antibodies to romosozumab following a 10 mg/kg dose. In this subject, the romosozumab concentration became undetectable on Day 7 and remained undetectable through Day 168 despite continued dosing with 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every two weeks.</p><p>About 19% of patients treated with the 210 mg dose developed binding antibodies. About 4% of those with binding antibodies tested positive for neutralizing antibodies. The 90 mg/mL formulation did not have a higher incidence of binding or neutralizing antibodies than the 70 mg/mL formulation in the head-to-head six month non-inferiority trial.</p><p>In the pivotal Phase 3 trial, romosozumab exposures were reduced by up to 25% among patients with binding antibodies compared to those who were antibody negative, with greater reductions among those with neutralizing antibodies. However, romosozumab concentrations among patients with binding antibodies were all within the range of concentrations observed in patients without binding antibodies. In addition, patients with binding antibodies had similar percent increases in bone mineral density compared to those without antibodies. Based on these data, it appears that most patients with antibodies to romosozumab should not have a reduction in efficacy, although it is possible that some patients may have reduced efficacy, as evidenced by the patient with neutralizing antibodies in the first-in-human trial who had undetectable romosozumab concentrations despite continued dosing. As discussed in the Safety section, patients with antibodies to romosozumab appear to have a slightly higher incidence of injection site reactions.</p></div>

Through Month 24, the incidence of new vertebral fracture was 0.6% in the romosozumab then denosumab group compared to 2.5% in the placebo then romosozumab group (p&lt;0.001). The relative risk reductions were 73% (95% confidence interval 53%, 84%) through Month 12 and 75% (95% confidence interval 60%, 84%) through Month 24. Based on the upper and lower bounds of the 95% confidence interval for the absolute risk reduction, the number needed to treat to prevent one new vertebral fracture is 56-125. The statistically persuasive findings from this single fracture outcomes trial (p&lt;0.001) together with the supportive bone mineral density data from the other trials provide convincing evidence of efficacy.  <ref type="bibr">1</ref> 1.3% (0.8%, 1.8%) 1.9% (1.3%, 2.5%) Relative risk reduction 1 73% (53%, 84%) 75% (60%, 84%) N=number randomized; N1=number in primary analysis set for vertebral fractures 1 95% confidence interval in parentheses Secondary efficacy endpoints: The incidence of clinical fracture through Month 12, the first hierarchical secondary endpoint, was 1.6% with romosozumab compared to 2.5% with placebo (p&lt;0.01), with a corresponding relative risk reduction of 36% (95% confidence interval 11%, 54%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Co-primary endpoint: As shown in</head><p>The romosozumab group had about 25% fewer nonvertebral fractures at months 12 and 24, but was not statistically superior to the placebo group at Month 12 (p=0.10, tested at the 0.05 alpha level) or to the placebo then denosumab group at Month 24 (p=0.029, tested at the 0.025 alpha level). The Applicant attributed this lack of statistical significance to reduced power. The power calculations had assumed a nonvertebral fracture incidence of 3.5% in the placebo group at 12 months and a treatment effect of at least 40%, but the observed incidence was only 2.1% and the relative risk reduction was only 25%. Because of the failed significance on nonvertebral fractures, statistical testing of the remaining hierarchical secondary endpoints should not proceed. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>, romosozumab increased bone mineral density compared to placebo at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck at Month 12, with the largest treatment effects seen at the lumbar spine. From Month 12-24, the percent increases in bone mineral density were slightly smaller in the romosozumab then denosumab group compared to the placebo then denosumab group, which resulted in slightly smaller treatment effects at Month 24 compared to Month 12. The percent increases compared to placebo at Month 12 and Month 24 had associated p-values of less than 0.001, although these p-values are nominal because this testing was not controlled for type I error.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subgroup analyses:</head><p>As discussed in the statistical review, analyses of the co-primary efficacy endpoints were consistent across tested subgroups based on age, race (Caucasian vs. non-Caucasian) and region, with no relevant treatment-by-subgroup interactions. Through Month 24, new vertebral fracture in the North American region occurred in none of 97 patients treated with romosozumab then denosumab and five of 87 patients treated with placebo then denosumab. These are too few events to reliably assess subgroup results in this geographic region. However, mean percent changes in bone mineral density among North Americans were consistent with the Reference ID: 4124009 (b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(4)</ref> overall results at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck, supporting the applicability of the foreign data to the population in the United States. Study 20120156: This was a multicenter, randomized, Phase 3 trial to evaluate the noninferiority of the to-be-marketed 90 mg/mL romosozumab concentration to the 70 mg/mL formulation used in the pivotal Phase 3 trial. There were four treatment groups randomized in a 22:5:22:5 ratio to six months of treatment with:</p><p> Romosozumab 90 mg/mL-two back-to-back injections for a total dose of 210 mg  Placebo 90 mg/mL -two back-to-back injections  Romosozumab 70 mg/mL-three back-to-back injections for a total dose of 210 mg  Placebo 70 mg/mL -three back-to-back injections</p><p>The placebo groups were included to allow for double-blinding within concentrations.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the percent change from baseline in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine. Romosozumab 90 mg/mL would be declared non-inferior to the 70 mg/mL formulation if the lower bound of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval for the treatment difference (90 mg/mL minus 70 mg/mL) was greater than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of -2%. This margin was calculated based on the treatment effect at six months on lumbar spine bone mineral density with the 210 mg monthly dose in the dose-finding Phase 2 trial (which tested the 70 mg/mL formulation). That treatment effect was 8.0% (95% confidence interval 6.6%, 9.3%). The non-inferiority margin allows at most a 30% loss, which is our standard noninferiority margin for bone mineral density, and is acceptable.</p><p>Results: In this trial, 118 patients were randomized to romosozumab 70 mg/mL, 123 patients were randomized to romosozumab 90 mg/mL and 53 patients were randomized to placebo. Completion rates were 89% for placebo, 93% for romosozumab 70 mg/mL, and 95% for romosozumab 90 mg/mL. At baseline, lumbar spine bone mineral density was 0.8% across the two romosozumab arms and the placebo group. Compared to placebo, romosozumab 70 mg/mL increased lumbar spine mineral density by 8.8% and romosozumab 90 mg/mL increased lumbar spine bone mineral density by 8.4%. The LS mean treatment difference (90 mg/mL vs. 70 mg/mL formulation) was -0.4% (95% confidence interval -1.5%, 0.7%). The to-be-marketed concentration was declared non-inferior to the Phase 3 concentration because the lower bound of -1.5% is greater than the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -2.0%. Consistent findings were seen for bone mineral density changes at the total hip and femoral neck.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Safety</head><p>Most of the safety data come from the pivotal Phase 3 trial, which was much larger than the other trials. The one-year placebo-controlled data from this trial were pooled with the one-year placebo-controlled data from the two dose-finding Phase 2 trials. These pooled data (hereafter referred to as the "pooled dataset") serve as the main dataset for safety analyses. Safety findings from the Phase 3 non-inferiority trial that used the to-be-marketed drug substance concentration of 90 mg/mL are of interest as well. This formulation had a similar safety profile to the 70 mg/mL formulation, except where noted below. See the Clinical review and Cross-Discipline Team Leader memorandum for a detailed discussion of safety.</p><p>Exposures: A total of 5478 patients received at least one dose of romosozumab, 3879 of whom were treated for at least one year. These exposures are adequate, and meet the International Conference on Harmonization E1A guideline recommendations for drugs that treat chronic, nonlife-threatening conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deaths:</head><p>In the pooled dataset, 0.8% of the romosozumab-treated patients and 0.7% of the placebo-treated patients died. There were no notable imbalances in the cause of death between treatment groups except for death due to lung cancer, which was reported in four romosozumabtreated patients and none receiving placebo. As discussed by the clinical reviewer, all four of these deaths occurred in current or former smokers, all cases of lung cancer (i.e., fatal plus nonfatal cases) were balanced between treatment groups (five cases each), and there was no overall imbalance in malignant/unspecified tumors between treatment groups (1.7% with romosozumab vs. 1.9% with placebo). These data on deaths do not raise any safety concerns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Serious Adverse Events:</head><p>In the pooled dataset, 9.5% of the romosozumab-treated patients and 8.8% of the placebo-treated patients reported at least one serious adverse event. As shown in the Clinical Review, for each of the preferred terms, there were generally very small imbalances between treatment groups (differences of less than 0.2%), sometimes favoring romosozumab and sometimes favoring placebo, none of which raise any safety concerns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discontinuations due to Adverse Events:</head><p>In the pooled dataset, adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported in 1.2% of the romosozumab-treated patients and 1.4% of the placebo-treated patients. The only adverse events leading to discontinuation in more than one romosozumab-treated patient were arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain, and extremity pain (each reported in three patients) and abdominal pain, back pain, and nausea (each reported in two patients). These data do not raise any safety concerns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Common Adverse Events:</head><p>In the pooled dataset, 78% of the romosozumab-treated patients and 80% of the placebo-treated patients reported at least one adverse event. The most commonly reported adverse events (with incidence above 2%) that also occurred at an incidence of at least 0.5% higher with romosozumab than placebo included nasopharyngitis (13.2% vs. 12.3%), arthralgia (12.7% vs. 11.8%), headache (6.5% vs. 5.8%), muscle spasm (4.5% vs. 3.8%), and neck pain (2.2% vs. 1.5%). These data can be labeled and do not raise major safety concerns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse Events of Interest:</head><p>Adverse events of interest based on animal findings or the mechanism of action include:</p><p>Atypical Femoral Fractures and Osteonecrosis of the Jaw: Atypical femoral fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw are associated with antiresorptive agents, and could potentially be seen with romosozumab, which has antiresorptive activity.</p><p>In the 12-month pooled dataset, there was one adjudicated case (0.03%) of atypical femoral fracture, which occurred in the pivotal Phase 3 trial in a patient treated with romosozumab for about 3.5 months, who fell from a standing height. This patient was not exposed to other products associated with atypical femoral fractures and reported prodromal pain in the affected region prior to study start. To date, four additional adjudicated cases of atypical femoral fracture have been identified in an ongoing alendronate-controlled, Phase 3 trial. One of these cases occurred in a patient who had received alendronate for 21 months after one year of romosozumab. The remaining three cases occurred in patients randomized to alendronate with treatment durations of 16, 17, and 28 months.</p><p>In the pivotal Phase 3 trial, there were two adjudicated cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw. One case occurred after nearly one year of treatment with romosozumab and the other occurred about three months after starting denosumab in a patient who was previously treated with romosozumab. In the ongoing alendronate-controlled, Phase 3 trial, there were two additional cases -one in a patient who had received alendronate for about 16 months after one year of romosozumab and one in a patient randomized to alendronate after 21 months of treatment.</p><p>The risks of atypical femoral fracture and osteonecrosis of the jaw appear rare, are well known with antiresorptive therapies, and can be handled with labeling.</p><p>Hypocalcemia: Romosozumab can cause hypocalcemia as a result of calcium influx into bone (during bone formation) and reduced calcium release from bone into the blood stream (because of decreased bone resorption). Romosozumab lowered serum calcium throughout the 12-month placebo-controlled period in the pivotal Phase 3 trial, with average reductions from baseline of about 0.1-0.2 mg/dL. There were no reported serious adverse events of hypocalcemia. To assess the extent of outliers, the Applicant reported the incidence of worst albumin-corrected serum calcium using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 grading system. In the pooled dataset, seven romosozumab-treated patients (0.2%) and three placebotreated patients (&lt;0.1%) developed grade 1 hypocalcemia (below the lower limit of normal but no lower than 8.0 mg/dL), seven romosozumab-treated patients (0.2%) and one placebo-treated patient (&lt;0.1%) developed grade 2 hypocalcemia (7.0-7.9 mg/dL), and no romosozumab-treated patients developed more severe hypocalcemia.</p><p>Although hypocalcemia was rare, it is important to note that the pivotal Phase 3 trial included calcium and vitamin D supplementation. In addition, patients with a screening 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration of 20-40 ng/mL received a loading dose of 50,000-60,000 international units of vitamin D after randomization. Those with a screening 25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentration below 20 ng/mL were excluded and those with a concentration above 40 ng/mL could still receive the vitamin D loading dose at the investigator's discretion. About three-fourths of randomized patients received the starting dose. Therefore, the risk of hypocalcemia without these interventions is unknown.</p><p>Patients with renal impairment may be at particular risk for hypocalcemia with romosozumab. In the renal impairment pharmacokinetic study, which included calcium and vitamin D supplementation, hypocalcemia was reported in none of the healthy subjects, in one of the patients with severe renal impairment, and in four of those with end-stage renal disease. This risk is not related to increased romosozumab exposures, which were comparable in those with endstage renal disease and healthy volunteers.</p><p>The risk of hypocalcemia can be adequately managed with labeling that includes statements about the need for adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation prior to, and during, treatment with romosozumab, as well as monitoring of serum calcium in patients at increased risk of hypocalcemia.</p><p>Hypophosphatemia: Romosozumab can cause hypophosphatemia based on the same mechanisms that can cause hypocalcemia. Sixteen romosozumab-treated patients (0.4%) and four placebotreated patients (0.1%) developed serum phosphate in the range of 2.0-2.4 mg/dL. This risk, which appears infrequent, can be handled with labeling.</p><p>Parathyroid Hormone: The pivotal Phase 3 trial included a substudy involving 656 patients to assess the effects of romosozumab on serum parathyroid hormone. Serum parathyroid hormone increased above baseline throughout the 12-month placebo-controlled treatment period, with 38% of the romosozumab-treated patients and 15% of the placebo-treated patients having at least one parathyroid hormone measurement above the upper limit of the reference range. Most of the outliers had parathyroid hormone concentrations that were up to twice the upper limit of the reference range, although 1.7% of the romosozumab-treated patients had elevations above three times the upper limit of normal. The highest measured serum parathyroid hormone in the romosozumab-treated group was about 300 pg/mL. These findings likely reflect a compensatory increase in parathyroid hormone because of calcium sequestration in bone. In the renal impairment clinical pharmacology study, there were greater increases in serum parathyroid hormone among romosozumab-treated patients with severe renal impairment and even further increases in those with end-stage renal disease. These findings should be labeled.</p><p>Hyperostosis: Hyperostosis (excessive bone growth) with neurological consequences is seen with sclerosteosis and van Buchem disease. In the pooled dataset, the incidence of hyperostosis was not increased with romosozumab (0.5%) compared to placebo (0.8%), nor was there an increase in adverse events related to neurological compression. A potential neurological consequence of hyperostosis is hearing loss. An audiology substudy in 498 patients did not detect a higher incidence of hearing loss with romosozumab compared to placebo.</p><p>Cardiovascular safety: The Applicant adjudicated cardiovascular events in the pivotal Phase 3 trial. During the 12-month placebo-controlled period, the romosozumab and placebo groups were balanced with regard to the incidence of adjudicated cardiovascular serious adverse events (1.3% in both arms) as well as adjudicated serious cardiac ischemic events (0.4% in both arms) and cerebrovascular events (0.3% in both arms).</p><p>However, two months prior to the action goal date, the Applicant informed us of unanticipated cardiovascular findings in an ongoing <ref type="bibr">Phase 3 trial (20110142)</ref>. This 4000-patient trial randomized women with postmenopausal osteoporosis to romosozumab or alendronate then had all patients take only alendronate after one year.</p><p>. Topline results showed a 50% mean reduction in the incidence of new vertebral fractures and a 19% mean reduction in the incidence of nonvertebral fractures with romosozumab followed by alendronate compared to alendronate alone. However, using the same adjudication process as that used in the pivotal Phase 3 trial, this trial found an imbalance during the 12-month double-blind period in adjudicated cardiovascular serious adverse events (2.5% romosozumab vs. 1.9% alendronate) as well as adjudicated serious cardiac ischemic events (0.8% romosozumab vs. 0.3% alendronate) and cerebrovascular events (0.8% romosozumab vs. 0.3% alendronate). Similar imbalances were also seen in a recently completed, small (n=244) male osteoporosis trial.</p><p>Corresponding hazard ratios through Month 12 for Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE), a composite endpoint assessing cardiovascular risk comprised of adjudicated serious adverse events of myocardial infarction and stroke as well as cardiovascular death were 1.03 (95% confidence interval 0.62, 1.72) for the pivotal Phase 3 trial, 1.87 (95% confidence interval <ref type="bibr">1.11, 3.14)</ref> for the ongoing alendronate-controlled trial, and 1.55 (95% confidence interval 0.31, 7.69) for the male osteoporosis trial.</p><p>Reasons for the discrepant trial results are unclear. We informed the Applicant that we would not be able to take a favorable action on this review cycle because we need to first conduct a thorough review of the cardiovascular issue before we can determine whether the benefits of romosozumab outweigh its risks. We stated this would not be possible in the remaining review cycle, even with a Major Amendment, because the Applicant still needs to complete their analyses of the data and put together a detailed submission of the findings. We also stated that an advisory committee meeting would likely be needed when those data are submitted.</p><p>Immunogenicity: In the pivotal Phase 3 trial, the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions, assessed using Standardized MedDRA queries, was similar among romosozumab-and placebo-treated patients, and was not increased further among those who had binding antibodies. This search strategy identified seven romosozumab-treated patients (0.2%) and no placebo-treated patients with hypersensitivity serious adverse events. Some of these cases suggest that romosozumab has the potential to cause significant hypersensitivity reactions. For example, one of the patients developed cough, dyspnea and wheezing about 24 hours after her first romosozumab dose, followed by a rash on the back two days later. Another case involved facial edema and generalized rash about three weeks after the fifth dose, treated with a glucocorticoid and antihistamine. Another patient developed a macular truncal rash three days after the first dose and exfoliative dermatitis and angioedema on Day 28.</p><p>In the trial comparing the 90 mg/mL and 70 mg/mL formulations, there were no reports of serious adverse events of hypersensitivity, although the overall incidence of hypersensitivity reactions was numerically higher with the 90 mg/mL formulation (11.4% vs. 2.5%).</p><p>Hypersensitivity can be handled with labeling.</p><p>Injection Site Reactions: In the pivotal Phase 3 trial, injection site reactions were more common with romosozumab (5.2%) than placebo (2.9%), with a higher incidence among romosozumabtreated patients who were antibody positive (6.8%) compared to those who were antibody negative (5.0%). Similar patterns were seen according to the neutralizing antibody status but the small numbers of patients with neutralizing antibodies limit conclusions.</p><p>None of the reported injection site reactions were categorized as serious. In the pivotal Phase 3 trial, these reactions were most commonly injection site pain (1.7% with romosozumab vs. 1.3% with placebo), erythema (1.5% vs. 0.1%), and pruritis (0.7% vs. 0.2%).</p><p>In the clinical trial comparing the 90 mg/mL and 70 mg/mL formulations, the overall incidence of injection site reactions was 10.6% with the 90 mg/mL formulation and 9.2% with the 70 mg/mL formulation. The 90 mg/mL formulation had numerically higher incidences of injection site erythema (5.7% vs. 1.7% with the 70 mg/mL formulation) and injection site swelling (2.4% vs. 0% with the 70 mg/mL formulation) whereas the 70 mg/mL formulation had a numerically higher incidence of injection site pain (5.9% vs. 2.4% with the 90 mg/mL formulation).</p><p>Injection site reactions can be handled with labeling.</p><p>Bone Histomorphometry: In the pivotal Phase 3 trial, the Applicant obtained quadruple-labeled iliac bone biopsies in 34 patients at Month 2, 73 patients at Month 12, and 47 patients at Month 24. These biopsies did not identify any safety concerns.</p><p>Other Laboratory Data and Vital Signs: The clinical reviewer identified no notable effects of romosozumab on other laboratory data or on vital signs.</p></div>

However, the proper name (romosozumab), as proposed, does not include a four-digit distinguishing suffix, in accordance with the final guidance "Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products" that issued in January 2017. DMEPA planned to address the suffix issue after approval when it appeared that the application would be approved on this review cycle. See their reviews for details. Because we are issuing a Complete Response letter, the trade name will need to be revisited during the next review cycle. We will also inform the Applicant in the Complete Response letter that we intend to assign a suffix to the proper name if/when FDA approves the application.</p><p>Financial Disclosures: Four sub-investigators from three Columbian sites that enrolled about 13% of patients in the pivotal Phase 3 trial did not return signed financial disclosures. As discussed in the clinical review, a sensitivity analysis of the co-primary efficacy endpoints excluding these four sites did not meaningfully change the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inspections:</head><p>The Office of Study Integrity and Surveillance (OSIS) conducted clinical and bioanalytical inspections of the key clinical pharmacology studies. The only noteworthy findings involved the bioanalytical inspection of the clinical pharmacology study used to help bridge the to-be-marketed 90 mg/mL formulation to the 70 mg/mL formulation used in the pivotal Phase 3 trial. The inspectors issued a Form 483, citing potential concerns . After obtaining additional information from the Applicant, OSIS determined that the bioanalytical data from this study are acceptable. The Office of Pharmaceutical Quality reviewed the confirmatory antibody assay and found it to be adequate.</p><p>The Office of Scientific Investigations (OSI) inspected four of the 222 clinical sites involved in the conduct of the pivotal Phase 3 trial. These four sites contributed 1054 (15%) of the 7180 enrolled patients in the trial. Three of the sites were classified as NAI (no deviation from regulations). The fourth site was issued an FDA Form 483 and classified as VAI (deviations from regulations). At this site, 147 patients (44%) were randomized outside of the protocolspecified screening windows. This was attributed to delayed access to investigational product from the Applicant and backlogged randomization. There were a few other minor deviations at this site (e.g., enrollment of eight patients who should have been excluded based on their baseline serum calcium concentrations). OSI concluded that the data generated from these four sites appear acceptable to support the proposed indication but recommended that the review team further assess the delay in time to randomization.</p><p>The protocol for the pivotal Phase 3 trial specified that the screening visit can last up to 35 days and allowed for an additional 35 day rescreening window if patients needed vitamin D supplementation. After learning about the delay at the site above, we asked the Applicant to assess the extent to which such delays occurred across the pivotal Phase 3 trial. The Applicant responded that 6.7% of the randomized population had a screening duration beyond 35 days and that 1.3% had a screening duration beyond 70 days (with most of these outliers coming from two Columbian sites, one of which was inspected). The baseline spine x-rays and some of the bone mineral density images were obtained during screening. Therefore, a long delay between these baseline images and randomization could potentially allow for interval changes (e.g., new fractures) during screening that would not be captured prior to randomization. However, given that only about 1% of patients had a screening duration beyond 70 days, and that bone mineral density changes occur very slowly, it is unlikely that this delay would have meaningfully affected the overall bone mineral density results. In addition, the Applicant compared the presence or absence of fractures on screening x-rays with those seen on the first post-treatment x-ray and noted full concordance, supporting that there was no interval development of vertebral fractures between the baseline images and randomization among the patients who had a screening duration beyond 70 days.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Human Factors:</head><p>The Applicant submitted Human Factors validation data from brodalumab, one of their other products to provide support that labeling will adequately communicate that two syringes are needed with romosozumab to administer one complete dose. DMEPA concluded that there were no critical differences in the use of romosozumab and brodalumab, and that the brodalumab Human Factors validation data do not show label comprehension difficulties, use task deviations, or dosing errors involving the use of two prefilled syringes to administer a complete dose. In addition, DMEPA reviewed results from the romosozumab labeling comprehension study, which evaluated the romosozumab Instructions for Use and found these results acceptable. No additional Human Factors data are needed. The Instructions for Use will be incorporated in Section 2 of the Prescribing Information if romosozumab can be approved.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit-Risk Summary and Assessment</head><p>Romosozumab, trade name Evenity, is a sclerostin inhibitor indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. The dosing regimen is 210mg administered by a healthcare professional once monthly for one year. It is this reviewer's recommendation that romosozumab cannot be approved for this indication at this time.</p><p>Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone leading to an increase in fragility and fracture. While osteoporosis can occur in both men and women, studies in postmenopausal women represent the majority of the data defining the disease and its sequelae. The risk of fracture increases with age and a history of a prior osteoporosis-related fracture. In older patients, fracture, predominantly hip fracture, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.</p><p>The efficacy of romosozumab for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was evaluated in a 24-month, randomized, multicenter, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in postmenopausal women aged 50 to 90 years (mean age of 71). Patients were randomized to receive one year of romosozumab 210mg (N = 3589) or placebo (N = 3591) once monthly by subcutaneous injection administered by a healthcare professional. During the second year of the trial, all patients received denosumab 60mg every 6 months. Patients also received daily supplemental calcium (500 to 1000 mg) and vitamin D (600 to 800 IU). 57% of patients were Caucasian, 12% were Asian, and 2% were Black; 40% were Hispanic. At baseline, the mean T-score was -2.7 at the lumbar spine and 18% of patients had at least one prevalent vertebral fracture.</p><p>The co-primary endpoints were the incidence of new vertebral fractures in patients treated with romosozumab compared to placebo at 12 months and the incidence of new vertebral fractures in patients treated with romosozumab/denosumab compared to placebo/denosumab at 24 months. Romosozumab resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of new vertebral fractures compared to placebo at 12 months (0.5% romosozumab compared to 1.8% placebo, p &lt;0.001). The absolute risk reduction in new vertebral fracture was 1.3% at 12 months and the relative risk reduction was 73% for romosozumab compared to placebo. The incidence of new vertebral fractures at 24 months was 0.6% in patients treated with romosozumab then denosumab compared to 2.5% in patients treated with placebo then denosumab (p &lt;0.001). The relative risk reduction in new vertebral fracture at 24 months was 75% for patients treated with romosozumab/denosumab compared to patients treated with placebo/denosumab and the absolute risk reduction was 1.9%. Romosozumab significantly increased bone mineral density at all sites with a treatment difference of 13% at the lumbar spine, 6% at the total hip and 5% at the femoral neck after 12 months of therapy.</p><p>Adverse events that occurred during treatment with romosozumab, a sclerostin inhibitor, include hypocalcemia, injection site reactions, and hypersensitivity reactions. Osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fractures also occurred.</p><p>There is a concern that inhibition of sclerostin by romosozumab may promote or exacerbate vascular calcification. In the postmenopausal osteoporosis safety population, there was no signal suggesting concern regarding cardiovascular safety with romosozumab use. However, in newly completed trials not submitted in the application, preliminary data suggest a cardiovascular safety concern for romosozumab use in both postmenopausal women and men. These data, once available, will require in depth review prior to reaching a conclusion on cardiovascular safety with romosozumab use. Therefore, a Complete Response action is recommended for this review cycle.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dimension Evidence and Uncertainties Conclusions and Reasons</head><p>Benefit  Romosozumab was evaluated in a single 24 month randomized phase 3 trial of 7180 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Patients received romosozumab 210mg or matching placebo by subcutaneous injection administered by a healthcare provider once a month for 12 months. After 12 months, all patients received open-label denosumab 60mg by subcutaneous injection administered by a healthcare provider every 6 months for 2 doses.  The co-primary endpoints were incidence of morphometric (seen on xray) vertebral fracture at 12 months and 24 months. Morphometric vertebral fracture is the accepted primary endpoint for fracture trials supporting an osteoporosis indication. Secondary endpoints include incidence of clinical fracture and incidence of nonvertebral fracture and change in bone mineral density  Romosozumab reduced the risk of vertebral fractures with an absolute risk reduction of 1.3% and a relative risk reduction of 73% at month 12 and an absolute risk reduction of 1.9% and a relative risk reduction of 75% at month 24  Romosozumab reduced the risk of clinical fractures with an absolute risk reduction of 1.2% and a relative risk reduction of 36% at month 12. However, clinical fracture is a composite endpoint of symptomatic vertebral fractures and nonvertebral fractures. In the fracture trial, 88% of clinical fractures were nonvertebral fractures.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background</head><p>The Applicant, Amgen, Inc. has submitted this Biologics License Application (BLA) under section 351 of the Public Health Services Act for romosozumab seeking an indication for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at increased risk of fracture. The proposed dose is 210 mg romosozumab once monthly. Romosozumab 210 mg is administered by a healthcare provider as 2 separate subcutaneous injections utilizing two single-use prefilled syringes. Romosozumab, also referred to as AMG785 in the application, is an IgG2 humanized monoclonal antibody that binds and inhibits sclerostin. The pharmacologic class proposed by the Applicant in labeling is "sclerostin inhibitor". Sclerostin is the protein product of the SOST gene, and is secreted by the osteocyte. Sclerostin is thought to act by binding to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 4, 5, and 6 (LRP4, LRP5, and LRP6), inhibiting Wnt signaling and reducing osteoblast-mediated bone formation. Inhibition of sclerostin leads to a transient stimulation of bone formation and inhibition of bone resorption. Romosozumab is first in class with sclerostin inhibitors being a new therapeutic class of osteoporosis therapies.</p><p>Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue leading to bone fragility and increased risk of fracture. The goal of therapy is to reduce the risk of fracture. Currently, there are nine different molecular entities, many with multiple formulations and regimens, approved for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_87">Table 1</ref>, page 24 of the primary clinical review).</p><p>The romosozumab IND (100391) was opened in November 2006. An End-of Phase 2 meeting was held in 2011. The Applicant proposed to conduct a 12-month placebo-controlled phase 3 fracture trial. After discussion, the Division advised that the duration of the study should be a minimum of 2 years. It was acceptable that romosozumab treatment be limited to one year. However, in that case all subjects (placebo and romosozumab treated subjects) should receive the same active control product for the second year. The endpoints could be coprimary -new vertebral fracture at 12 months and at 24 months.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Nonclinical Pharmacology/Toxicology</head><p>The nonclinical pharmacology/toxicology team is recommending that this BLA can be approved. The Applicant has conducted a complete pharmacology/toxicology program, which has been reviewed by the pharmacology/toxicology team. Please see the reviews from Dr. Gemma Kuijpers, Dr. Andrea Benedict, Dr. Laurie McLeod-Flynn, and Dr. Miyun Tsai-Turton for complete details.</p><p>Romosozumab is a humanized IgG2 monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits sclerostin. Sclerostin has an inhibitory effect on bone formation. Sclerostin is produced by the osteocyte and can bind to low density lipoprotein receptor related protein (LRP) 4, LRP5, or LRP6 receptors. Sclerostin interaction with LRP5/6 leads to inhibition of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway and ultimately decreased bone formation and increased bone resorption. Romosozumab binds to sclerostin and inhibits the interaction of sclerostin and LRP5/6, allowing increased bone formation.</p><p>Pharmacology: The Applicant conducted in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies with sclerostin-antibodies. In vitro studies showed high affinity binding of romosozumab to sclerostin, which led to blockade of the sclerostin-mediated inhibition of bone matrix mineralization in a mouse calvarial cell line.</p><p>Bone quality studies of up to 12 months in duration were conducted in ovariectomized rats and monkeys. The doses used were up to 19x human exposure in rats and 22x human exposure in monkeys, based on AUC. Romosozumab increased bone mass and strength of lumbar spine,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Reference ID: 4123729 (b) (4)</formula><p>Cross Discipline Team Leader Review 10 tibia, femur, and radius in a dose-and time-dependent manner. The bone changes consisted of increases in trabecular thickness in vertebrae and long bone metaphyses, as well as increases in cortical thickness in long bones. The noted effects were due to stimulation of bone formation concomitant with suppression of bone resorption mostly at trabecular and endosteal bone surfaces. In monkeys, both formation and resorption responses were transient and peaked at 10 weeks. Based on bone mass vs. strength correlations, bone quality was maintained at all evaluated sites.</p><p>Toxicology: Toxicity studies of up to 6-month duration were conducted in rats and monkeys. The main findings were related to the pharmacologic effect of romosozumab, specifically increasing bone formation and bone density with evidence of hyperostosis affecting the bone marrow. Findings included decreases in calcium and phosphorus levels and decreases in RBC, WBC and platelets with evidence of extramedullary hematopoiesis. Exposure multiples in the 6-month studies ranged from 1-38x and 1-93x human exposure, in rats and monkeys, respectively.</p><p>Because of rapidly accumulating knowledge of the role of sclerostin, LRP 5/6, and Wnt betacatenin signaling, the Applicant included evaluation of multiple potential clinical safety concerns in the clinical trials. This approach was based on the weight of evidence from nonclinical studies, clinical studies and published literature. As outlined in Dr. Kuijper's review, there is no nonclinical evidence suggesting romosozumab would increase the risk for osteoarthritis, vascular calcification, increased longitudinal bone growth, hyperostosis, altered hematopoiesis, sarcopenia, altered glucose metabolism, or exacerbation of TNFα-mediated inflammation. Additionally, the nonclinical data do not support a concern about tumor induction or promotion due to activation of Wnt signaling.</p><p>With specific regard for vascular calcification, aged OVX monkeys treated for up to 12 months with doses equivalent to 1 and 22 times human exposure at 210 mg monthly did not result in aortic calcification.</p><p>Qualification of impurities: This drug product contains no novel excipients. Other product related impurities have been adequately qualified.</p><p>Genotoxicity: The genotoxicity potential of romosozumab was not evaluated. Romosozumab is a protein product and lacks non-protein or linkage material and therefore is unlikely to react with DNA or chromosomal material.</p><p>Carcinogenicity: Osteosarcoma has previously been observed with the bone anabolic agents. In rats treated for 2 years with parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTHrP) analogues, osteosarcoma and other bone tumors developed at low human exposure multiples. For romosozumab, a carcinogenicity study was conducted in Sprague Dawley rats. The rats were dosed for up to 98 weeks with 0, 3, 10, 50 mg/kg/week of romosozumab, equivalent to 1-19x human exposure. The study did not show any significant increases in tumor incidences. A low incidence of osteosarcoma (2/54) was observed in high dose males at 19x romosozumab human exposure. The large exposure multiple suggests that romosozumab is unlikely to increase the human risk of osteosarcoma.</p><p>Reproductive toxicology: Romosozumab's reproductive toxicity was evaluated in rat fertility and early embryonic development, embryofetal development and pre-and postnatal development (PPND) studies. Findings in the embryonic studies included reduced ventral processes of the 6th cervical vertebrae at doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg (17-56x human exposure). This finding is not considered clinically relevant due to lack of the anatomical structure in humans. Fetal poly-and syndactyly were observed in the embryofetal study at 32x human exposure. This finding is consistent with the syndactyly observed in sclerostosis patients and in SOST knockout mice. The finding is of low clinical relevance based on the exposure multiple, and the timing of digit formation in the first trimester in humans, when placental transfer of immunoglobulins is limited. In the PPND study, there were small decreases in bone mass and size in the F1 offspring at 1.5-56x human exposure of unclear biological significance. None of these findings are considered relevant for the postmenopausal indication.</p><p>Labeling: In the first two rounds of label negotiations, the nonclinical team made changes to the proposed product labeling including <ref type="bibr">Sections 8,</ref><ref type="bibr">12.1,</ref><ref type="bibr">13.1,</ref><ref type="bibr">and 13.2</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Clinical Pharmacology</head><p>The clinical pharmacology team is recommending that this BLA can be approved; please see Dr. Lin Zhou's review for complete details.</p><p>General clinical pharmacology: Romosozumab is administered as a subcutaneous injection once monthly for 12 months. The 210 mg dose requires 2 syringes of 105 mg each with injection of the second syringe occurring immediately after the first syringe. The estimated bioavailability of a romosozumab 210 mg was 81%. The median time to maximum romosozumab concentration (Tmax) was 5 days (range: 2 to 7 days) following subcutaneous administration. The mean (SD) maximum serum concentration (Cmax) was 22.2 (5.8) mcg/mL and the mean area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was 389 (127) mcg*day/mL. Steady-state concentration was reached by month 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intrinsic factors:</head><p>Renal Impairment: Mineral metabolism is impaired in patients with renal disease. A renal impairment study was conducted with romosozumab because of the potential for effects related to mineral metabolism, a pharmacodynamic effect of romosozumab. The population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated an increase in romosozumab exposure with increasing severity of renal impairment.</p><p>A clinical study of subjects with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis was conducted with the proposed romosozumab 210 mg dose. In subjects with severe renal impairment, mean C max and AUC were 29% and 44% higher compared to healthy subjects. However most subjects with severe renal impairment had C max and AUC values that overlapped with the exposure range seen in healthy subjects. In subjects with ESRD on hemodialysis, mean romosozumab exposure was similar to healthy subjects. The number of subjects with hypocalcemia was 0/8 healthy subjects, 1/8 subjects with severe renal impairment, and 4/8 in subjects with ESRD requiring hemodialysis. There was no increased exposure to romosozumab in hemodialysis subjects, so the hypocalcemia is likely due to combination of underlying alterations in mineral metabolism associated with renal disease itself and romosozumab effects.</p><p>Drug-Drug interactions: No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. Romosozumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, is not metabolized by CYP enzymes, and therefore, has a very low risk of drug-drug interactions.</p><p>Bisphosphonate: The pharmacokinetics of romosozumab was similar in patients transitioning from alendronate therapy.</p><p>Demographic interactions: Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no notable difference in pharmacokinetics with age (20-89 years), gender, or race were noted.</p><p>Formulation bridging: The Phase 3 fracture trial in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis used romosozumab 70 mg/mL in a glass prefilled syringe (PFS) presentation containing drug substance and drug product manufactured at Amgen Thousand Oaks (ATO). The planned commercial drug substance process was transferred from ATO to (Amgen Rhode Island, [ARI]). The commercial 90 mg/mL PFS drug product manufacturing process was transferred from ATO to .</p><p>The Applicant conducted a single-dose, randomized pharmacokinetic equivalence study to demonstrate the comparative bioavailability of the clinical trial 70 mg/ml formulation and the 90 mg/mL formulation (study 20120277). In addition, a clinical study was conducted comparing bone mineral density changes achieved with romosozumab 210 mg delivered as three 1.0 mL PFS injections of the 70 mg/mL concentration and romosozumab 210 mg delivered as two 1.17-mL PFS injections of the 90 mg/mL concentration (study 20120156).</p><p>Both study 20120277 and 20120156 utilized drug substance and drug product manufactured at ATO.

While the drug substance manufacturing sites were different, both the ATO and the ARI drug product were manufactured at ATO. To support drug product manufactured at the Applicant is relying upon analytic comparability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 20120277</head><p>is an open label, single dose, parallel group study in healthy subjects that compared the pharmacokinetic profile of a single dose of romosozumab 210 mg delivered as three 1.0 mL PFS injections of the 70 mg/mL concentration (Process 2 at ATO) with two 1.17-mL PFS injections of the 90 mg/mL concentration (Process 2 at ATO). A total of 172 subjects were randomized (87 received the 70 mg/mL formulation, 85 received the 90 mg/mL formulation). Of the randomized subjects, the Applicant included 166 subjects in the PK analysis (82 in the 70 mg/mL group, 84 in the 90 mg/mL group). The geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of test (90 mg/mL) to reference (70 mg/mL) for C max was 0.992 (0.909 , 1.082), AUC last 0.897 (0.814 , 0.989), and AUC inf 0.896 (0.813 , 0.987). However, as outlined in the clinical pharmacology primary review, on FDA analysis when 2 subjects were excluded, the CI for C max and AUC last remained in the range demonstrating bioequivalence (0.8 -1.25) but the lower bound of the 90% CI for AUC inf fell to 0.799. The clinical pharmacology team accepts that comparability has been established because AUC inf is based on extrapolated data and the extrapolation method may not be the most appropriate method due to romosozumab's drug disposition. Additionally, the small difference in AUC inf would not be expected to have clinical implications. This reviewer agrees with the clinical pharmacology rationale.</p><p>The Office of Study Integrity and Surveillance (OSIS) conducted an inspection of the bioanalytical site for study 20120277. Concerns were raised regarding drug stability during the freeze-thaw stability for method validation. These concerns were conveyed to the Applicant and the Applicant reevaluated the freeze-thaw stability and provided additional data. Upon review of the data, the data from the bioanalytical portion of study 20120277 are reliable.</p><p>Study 20120156 is a 6 month, randomized, placebo controlled study evaluating the BMD changes of romosozumab 210 mg delivered using three 1.0 mL PFS injections of the 70 mg/mL concentration and romosozumab 210 mg delivered using two 1.17-mL PFS injections of the 90 mg/mL concentration in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Please see the primary statistical review and the primary clinical review, pages 86-90 for complete details.</p><p>Subjects were randomized 22:5:22:5 to romosozumab 210 mg as two injections of 90 mg/mL in 1.17 mL PFS; placebo as two 1.17 mL PFS injections; romosozumab 210 mg as three injections of 70 mg/mL in 1mL PFS; placebo as three 1 mL PFS injections. Subjects also received calcium (500 -1000mg daily) and vitamin D (600 -800 IU daily) supplementation. The primary endpoint was change in lumbar spine BMD at month 6. The noninferiority margin was set based on data from the Phase 2 trial 20060326. In this trial, the treatment difference for romosozumab 210 mg (3 injections of 70 mg/mL) at 6 months was 8% (95% CI : <ref type="bibr">6.6 , 9.3)</ref>. Therefore, 30% of the lower bound of the CI yields a NI margin of 2%.</p><p>A total of 294 subjects were enrolled into the trial (118 received 70 mg/mL, 123 received 90 mg/mL, 53 received placebo) and 273 (93%) subjects were included in the primary analysis data set (110 (93%) 70 mg/mL, 117 (95%) 90 mg/mL, 44 (83%) placebo). The change from baseline to month 6 in BMD was 9.6% for 70 mg/mL, 9.2% for 90 mg/mL, and 0.8% for placebo. The difference between the 70 mg/mL concentration and the 90 mg/mL concentration is 0.4% (95% CI: -1.5 , 0.7). Therefore, BMD increases achieved with treatment of romosozumab 210 mg delivered using the 90 mg/mL formulation are not inferior to romosozumab 210 mg delivered using the 70 mg/mL formulation at 6 months.</p></div>

The Applicant adequately demonstrated that the ATO and drug products are analytically comparable. Because there are no significant process changes that could impact safety or potency, analytical comparability is sufficient to support the DP manufacturing.</p><p>TQT study: Because romosozumab is a large protein product that is unlikely to interact with cardiac cell ion channels, a thorough QT study was not required or performed.</p><p>Immunogenicity: Romosozumab is a large humanized monoclonal antibody that could trigger an immune response. The Applicant developed and validated two assays to detect the presence of anti-romosozumab antibodies in human serum: an electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based bridging immunoassay to detect binding antibodies to romosozumab and an ECL-based competitive binding assay to determine the neutralizing potential of anti-drug antibodies (ADA). Data on antibody titer is not available. The Applicant used signal to noise values to evaluate the magnitude of the antibody response.</p><p>Romosozumab's immunogenicity potential was assessed in all clinical studies of healthy volunteers and postmenopausal women. In Phase 1 studies 66/832 (8%) subjects developed binding antibodies to romosozumab after at least a single dose of drug product. Neutralizing antibodies developed in 18 subjects (27% of subjects with binding antibodies, 2% of all Phase 1 subjects).</p><p>In the Phase 2 and 3 studies, 20% of subjects developed binding antibodies and 5% with binding antibodies developed neutralizing antibodies. In some cases, the antibodies were transient and the antibody assays were negative by the last time point tested. A transient romosozumab response was seen in approximately 50% of subjects with positive binding antibodies. A transient response occurred in 24% of subjects of subjects with positive neutralizing antibodies.</p><p>The 24 month dose finding study was extended to include one year off of romosozumab followed by a one year retreatment phase. In the initial treatment period, 60/ 255 (24%) subjects exposed to romosozumab developed binding antibodies and 8 (13%) of those subjects developed neutralizing antibodies. There was not an apparent dose-related trend in antibody formation. During months 24 to 36, 45 of 179 (25%) subjects exposed to romosozumab had positive binding antibodies at month 36. Six (13%) subjects with binding antibodies were positive for neutralizing antibodies. During repeat exposure to romosozumab (month 36 to 48), 22 (16%) subjects who were antibody positive prior to retreatment were negative for <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(4)</ref> binding antibodies in the retreatment phase, 11 (8%) subjects who were positive prior to retreatment remained positive during the retreatment phase and 2 (1%) subjects developed new binding antibodies to romosozumab.

In phase 1 studies, one subject enrolled in a single dose study who developed neutralizing antibodies to romosozumab was inadvertently then enrolled in a multi-dose study.</p><p>In the second study (second exposure to romosozumab), the subject received a dose of 1mg/kg of romosozumab. Romosozumab serum concentration rose to 2010 ng/ml on Day 5, dropped below the lower limit of quantification (BQL = 50 ng/mL) on Day 7 and remained BQL through the PK sampling window up to 168 days, despite continued dosing once every two weeks.</p><p>In the Phase 3 studies of 6 months duration or longer, the presence of binding antibodies appeared to decrease romosozumab exposure up to 25% at months 3, 6, and 9. At month 12, exposures were approximately 10% decreased in antibody positive subjects compared to antibody negative subjects.</p><p>Effects of anti-drug antibody development on efficacy parameters: Exploratory analyses were conducted to evaluate the effect on romosozumab antibody on BMD. In the fracture efficacy trial 20070337, the month 15 antibody status was used for evaluation. As outlined in the table below, at months 12 and 24, subjects who developed antibodies experienced similar BMD increases to subjects without antibodies to romosozumab. Additionally, the assay S/N ratio did not appear to affect the BMD results. </p></div>

This is the first osteoporosis indication for this product and fracture efficacy data are required to support approval. The Division has generally accepted a robust result (p value &lt;0.01) from a single phase 3 fracture trial with supportive bone mineral density data from the dose finding study for approval of an initial osteoporosis indication. The Applicant conducted one key fracture efficacy trial (20070337) with supportive evidence from the dose-finding trial 20060326.</p><p>Because there is a large single fracture efficacy trial, an integrated summary of efficacy will not be the focus of this review. The dose-finding trial 20060326 is presented and discussed, followed by the efficacy findings of trial 20070337.</p><p>Trial 20060326: Please refer to the clinical review, pages 65 -82 for complete details. Trial 20060326 is a randomized, placebo and active-controlled 24-month dose finding study that evaluated 5 different doses of romosozumab. The study has been extended several times. The first extension (months 24 to 36) is for a 12 month phase where subjects were randomized to either placebo or denosumab 60 mg SC every 6 months. The second extension (months 36 to 48) is for a retreatment phase with romosozumab. The third extension remains ongoing and includes 24 months of zoledronic acid 5 mg once yearly or no treatment. All subjects also were to take at least 1000 mg calcium and at least 800 IU Vitamin D daily. During the romosozumab retreatment phase, subjects were to receive a 50,000 IU oral vitamin D loading dose.</p><p>For the initial 24 months study, postmenopausal women with low bone mass were randomized to receive placebo or romosozumab as follows:</p><p> romosozumab 70 mg (50 subjects) or placebo (10 subjects) SC monthly  romosozumab 140 mg (50 subjects) or placebo (10 subjects) SC monthly  romosozumab 210 mg (50 subjects) or placebo (10 subjects) SC monthly  romosozumab 140 mg (50 subjects) or placebo (10 subjects) SC every 3 months  romosozumab 210 mg (50 subjects) or placebo (10 subjects) SC every 3 months Two additional arms were open label:</p><p> alendronate 70 mg po weekly for the first 12 months. Subjects were then switched to romosozumab 140 mg monthly for months 12 -24.  teriparatide 20mcg SC daily for the first 12 months. Subjects were discontinued after 12 months.</p><p>Subjects and study personnel were blinded to treatment (romosozumab or placebo) and dose (70mg/140mg/210mg) but not to dose frequency.</p><p>For the first 24 months of the study, romosozumab was provided in single-use 5 mL vials containing approximately 1 mL of study medication (70 mg/mL romosozumab). Placebo presentation was identical. For the month 36 -48 romosozumab retreatment phase, romosozumab was presented in a single-use 1 mL prefilled syringe containing the 70 mg/mL formulation.</p><p>The primary endpoint is change in lumbar spine BMD at month 12. Secondary endpoints included change in lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip BMD at month 6; change in femoral neck, total hip, and distal 1/3 radius BMD at month 12; change in bone turnover markers (P1NP, CTX, OC, BSAP) at months <ref type="bibr">1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12.</ref> All active control analyses are exploratory. For all endpoints, the placebo group was pooled. Additionally, the study included a bone biopsy substudy, which included 32 subjects, and a quantitative CT (QCT) substudy, which enrolled 172 subjects.</p><p>Study Population: The enrolled postmenopausal population included women age 55 -85 years, with low bone mass. Subjects with a positive osteoporotic fracture history were excluded from enrollment. The mean age of the enrolled population was 67 years, 86% of the population was white, and the mean lumbar spine T score was -2.3. As outlined in the table below, 92% of subjects completed the initial 12 months of the study and 87% completed the study to month 24.For the open label alendronate arm, after the first year, subjects in the alendronate arm were transitioned to romosozumab 140mg monthly. Overall, 51 subjects were enrolled, 49 subjects completed the first 12 months of the study and 45 subjects completed through month 24. Subjects in the teriparatide arm only participated in the first 12 months of the study, 55 subjects were randomized and 46 subjects completed through month 12. For months 24 to 36, subjects who chose to continue in the study were re-randomized to receive placebo or denosumab 60 mg SC every 6 months. The teriparatide group was discontinued, the romosozumab groups were pooled and randomized while the placebo and alendronate/romosozumab 140mg qmonth groups were randomized separately. As outlined in the table below, 260 subjects chose to continue into the denosumab extension, with 131 receiving placebo and 129 receiving denosumab. For months 36 to 48, subjects who were initially in the alendronate arm were discontinued from the trial. All subjects from the original placebo or romosozumab arms who continued in the trial received romosozumab 210 mg monthly. Overall, 167 subjects enrolled in the romosozumab retreatment phase and 155 subjects completed 48 months. Results: Lumbar spine BMD: In the first 24 months of the study, bone mineral density of the spine was evaluated at baseline, and months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24.The primary endpoint is percent change in lumbar spine BMD at month 12. As outlined in the table below, treatment with all doses of romosozumab resulted in significant increases in BMD. More robust results were achieved with monthly romosozumab dosing. Treatment with alendronate 70 mg weekly resulted in a 4.1% increase in lumbar spine BMD at month 12. Treatment with daily teriparatide 20 mcg resulted in a 7.1% increase in lumbar spine BMD at month 12. Romosozumab 210 mg qmonth resulted in BMD increases that were significantly greater then both active controls (p&lt;0.0001 after Hochberg adjustment). Other BMD Endpoints: As outlined in the primary clinical review, romosozumab increased BMD of the hip with larger increases achieved with the monthly dosing groups. The treatment difference compared to placebo with romosozumab 210 mg monthly was 4.9% at the total hip and 4.8% at the femoral neck. At the mid third radius, a site of predominantly cortical bone, small decreases in BMD were seen in all romosozumab dose groups, similar to placebo. The treatment difference compared to placebo with romosozumab 210 mg monthly was -0.3%. The finding of no change or loss in cortical BMD of the radius is consistent with other anabolic agents.</p><p>BMD at Month 24: All subjects in the placebo and romosozumab dose groups continued on their blinded therapy for the second year of the study. Subjects in the teriparatide arm were discontinued after 12 months and subjects in the alendronate arm were transitioned to romosozumab 140 mg monthly. As shown in figure 10-8 below, BMD in the romosozumab arms did continue to increase in the second year of therapy although the increases are not as robust as those achieved in the first year of therapy. Bone Turnover Markers: Both markers of bone formation (P1NP, osteocalcin, and BSAP) and markers of bone resorption (CTX) were evaluated during the first 24 months of the study.</p><p>As shown in the figure below, P1NP, a marker of bone formation increased in all romosozumab groups and were greatest at month 1. The increases in bone formation were not maintained and levels returned to baseline by month 9. Levels remained above baseline the longest for the 210 mg monthly group (yellow). Bone formation with alendronate therapy (gray) in the first 12 months is suppressed, which is expected. In the second year, with romosozumab 140 mg monthly treatment following the alendronate therapy, bone formation does increase in a similar pattern to other romosozumab groups. The teriparatide group is not</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Reference ID: 4123729</formula><p>Cross Discipline Team Leader Review 20 displayed below because subjects were discontinued at 12 months. During the 12 months of teriparatide treatment, P1NP increased, reaching a plateau at month 6 and remained elevated through month 12. Therefore, stimulation of bone formation seen with romosozumab is different from the other anabolic agents available. <ref type="bibr">Source: CSR 20060326, Figure 14q-4.4.3, page 2407</ref> For bone resorption, serum CTX is suppressed with romosozumab therapy. As shown in the figure below, the greatest decreases are seen at month 1. Monthly dosing groups romosozumab 140 mg (red) and 210 mg (yellow) remained suppressed through month12. The largest decreases in serum CTX were seen with alendronate therapy (gray). Alendronate is an antiresorptive agent, so the sustained decrease in CTX is expected. In the second year of the study during treatment with romosozumab 140 mg monthly, serum CTX trended up toward baseline. <ref type="bibr">Source: CSR 20060326, Figure 14q-4.5.1, page 2409</ref> Denosumab Extension: During months 24 to 36, subjects who chose to participate in the denosumab extension were randomized to receive either denosumab or placebo. As displayed in the figure below, treatment with denosumab resulted in increases in BMD. Cessation of osteoporosis therapy and treatment with placebo resulted in BMD returning to baseline 12 months after romosozumab is discontinued. Similar results were seen for total hip and femoral neck BMD. Romosozumab Retreatment: Subjects who completed months 36 of the denosumab extension could elect to participate in the romosozumab retreatment. All subjects who participated in the month 36 to 48 extension received romosozumab 210 mg monthly. As displayed in the figure below, following placebo, retreatment with romosozumab had a similar pattern of BMD increase as was seen with initial romosozumab treatment. Following the antiresorptive medication denosumab, there appears to be a 6 month lag before BMD with romosozumab retreatment begins to increase. Conclusions: The data from trial 20060326 demonstrate dose-related increases in bone mineral density with romosozumab therapy. Bone mineral density increases are more robust with monthly dosing as compared to every 3 month dosing. At the End-of Phase 2 meeting, the Applicant proposed the 210 mg monthly dose for further development. This is the only dose that was statistically better then both alendronate and teriparatide. The Division recommended that both the 140 mg monthly dose and the 210 mg monthly dose be taken into Phase 3 as the BMD responses were similar. The Applicant chose to take 210 mg monthly for evaluation in the fracture efficacy trial. Therefore, it is unknown as to whether a lesser dose of the medication would achieve fracture efficacy results. The Applicant also proposed limiting romosozumab therapy to one year of treatment. The Division agreed that the data support limiting dosing to one year of therapy.</p><p>Trial 20101291 is a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study is Japanese women with osteoporosis. Please see the primary clinical review, pages 82-86 for complete details.

While this study is not sufficient to support any comparative claims, it does offer some information on BMD response to romosozumab in subjects previously treated with bisphosphonates. Enrolled subjects were required to have been taking a bisphosphonate for at least 3 years prior to screening and to have been treated in the last year and immediately prior to screening with alendronate 70mg weekly, or equivalent. As outlined in the figure below, there is no apparent lag in BMD increases achieved with romosozumab therapy in subjects previously treated with bisphosphonates. <ref type="bibr">Source: CSR 20080289, page 213</ref> Trial 20070337: Trial 20070337 is a 24-month, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluating healthcare provider administered monthly subcutaneous romosozumab 210 mg for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO). The coprimary endpoints of the study are incidence of new morphometric (radiographic) vertebral fractures at month 12 and 24 months. Because of the waning bone effect of romosozumab after 1 year, the Applicant chose to limit the duration of romosozumab exposure to one year. Therefore, this 24 month study is designed as double blind in the first year, and then all subjects will receive healthcare provider administered open label denosumab 60 mg every 6 month in the second year. Multiple substudies were included in this trial: a pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy; a bone turnover marker (BTM) and biomarker substudy; an imaging substudy I (forearm DXA, total body DXA, high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT)); an imaging substudy II (lumbar spine, proximal femur DXA substudy); a bone biopsy substudy; a calcium substudy; an audiology substudy; an osteoarthritis substudy; a pharmacogenetics substudy; and mineral substudy (serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and urinary calcium).</p><p>Study population: Trial 20070337 enrolled postmenopausal women with osteoporosis age 50 to 90 years. Osteoporosis was defined as a BMD T-score at the total hip or femoral neck of ≤ -2.5. Subjects with a history of hip fracture, severe vertebral fracture, or more than 2 moderate vertebral fractures were excluded from the study. Subjects with metabolic bone disease, laboratory abnormalities, or use of drugs known to affect bone were also excluded. Prior use of osteoporosis therapies was allowed with appropriate wash out. The original study enrollment was targeting 6000 subjects. The sample size was increased to 6600 subjects after blinded review of the pooled nonvertebral fracture incidence was 12.5% lower than the original assumptions.</p><p>Study treatments: Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive either romosozumab 210 mg or matching placebo by subcutaneous (SC) injection every month for the first 12 months of the trial. Injections were administered by a healthcare provider. The dose of 210 mg required three 1 mL syringes of 70 mg/mL romosozumab. Randomization was stratified by age (&lt; 75 years, ≥ 75 years) and prevalent vertebral fracture (yes, no), as determined by site staff at randomization based on local reading of the spine X-ray. After the 12-month double-blind placebo-controlled treatment period, all subjects entered the 12-month open-label denosumab treatment period where they received denosumab 60 mg SC every 6 months in an open-label fashion while still remaining blinded to their initial treatment assignment (romosozumab or placebo). Denosumab injections were also administered by a healthcare provider. Subjects were to receive daily calcium (500 to 1000 mg) and vitamin D (600 to 800 IU) supplementation.</p><p>Efficacy measures: The coprimary endpoints of trial 20070337 are subject incidence of new morphometric vertebral fracture at month 12 and month 24. Spine radiographs were obtained at screening, month 6, month 12, and month 24. Morphometric vertebral fractures were determined using the semiquantitative method of Genant. Nonvertebral fractures were confirmed by the central read facility using radiographs, CT, or MRI. If these were not available, a medical report was acceptable. Bone mineral density of the hip and lumbar spine by DXA was obtained at baseline, month 12 and month 24.</p><p>A central radiologic facility, was used for fracture assessment, DXA and quantitative CT readings. The central read facility managed DXA readings and DXA quality control including cross calibration with a central phantom and longitudinal quality control conducted by the study sites and reviewed by the central facility.</p><p>To control the overall type I error, the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were tested sequentially at the 2-sided 5% significance level, as listed:</p><p>1. Subject incidence of new vertebral fracture through months 12 and 24 2. Subject incidence of clinical fracture through month 12 3. Subject incidence of non-vertebral fracture through months 12 and 24 (testing for months 12 and 24 were controlled by Hochberg procedure at 0.05 level within the step) 4. Subject incidence of clinical fracture through month 24 5. Subject incidence of major non-vertebral fracture through months 12 and 24 (testing for months 12 and 24 were controlled by Hochberg procedure at 0.05 level within the step) 6.

Subject incidence of hip fracture through months 12 and 24 (testing for months 12 and 24 were controlled by Hochberg procedure at 0.05 levels within the step)</p><p>The Applicant defined several analysis dataset populations. The primary analysis population for vertebral fractures included all randomized subjects who had a baseline and at least one post-baseline evaluation for vertebral fracture at or before the specific timepoint under consideration. The full analysis population for all other fracture assessments (nonvertebral fracture, clinical fracture, major nonvertebral fracture, major osteoporotic fracture, hip fracture) included all randomized subjects. The primary efficacy analysis population for BMD and patient reported endpoints included all randomized subjects who had a baseline and at least one post baseline evaluation of the endpoint of interest at or before the specific timepoint under consideration.</p></div>

However, it is possible given the construct of the primary analysis population. If a subject had a baseline radiograph and then only had spine radiograph at month 24, they could be included in the month 24 analysis population and excluded from the month 12 population.</p><p>Subgroup analyses were conducted based on age (&lt; 65 years, ≥ 65 years, &lt; 75 years, ≥ 75 years), race, geographic region, prevalent vertebral fracture status, history of fragility fracture, history of nonvertebral fracture after age 55 years, baseline lumbar spine BMD T-score, baseline hip or femoral neck BMD T-score, baseline body mass index, and baseline World Health Organization Fracture Risk Assessment (FRAX) score for major osteoporotic fracture. As displayed in the primary statistical review Appendix A2, the reduction in new vertebral fracture risk showed similar trends in all subgroups evaluated.</p><p>Clinical and Nonvertebral Fracture: In the statistical hierarchy of fracture assessments, clinical fracture at month 12 is the first secondary endpoint. Nonvertebral fracture at month 12 and 24 is the next endpoint in the statistical hierarchy, followed by clinical fracture at month The Applicant attributes the lack of significance of the nonvertebral fracture reduction to a regional subgroup interaction in Central/Latin America where a lower than expected nonvertebral fracture rate in the placebo group was observed (assumed 3.5%, observed 1.2%). The observed nonvertebral fracture rate was also lower than expected in the small enrolled population in North America (assumed 3.5%, observed 1.1%). In the original 24 month sample size calculation, the Applicant assumed a nonvertebral fracture rate of 4% during the first 12 months of the trial and with a sample size of 6000 subjects the study had a power of 93% to detect a 40% decrease in nonvertebral fractures after 12 months of romosozumab compared with placebo. During the study, the pooled nonvertebral fracture rate was monitored and the Applicant observed that the rate was lower than expected. Therefore, the sample size was increased in protocol amendment number 4 using a 3.5% nonvertebral fracture rate, increasing the sample size to 6600. The total sample size of 6600 subjects was anticipated to provide 91% power to detect a 40% decrease in the risk of nonvertebral fracture after romosozumab treatment for 12 months.</p><p>Other Fracture Endpoints: Other fracture endpoints included in the hierarchal testing were subject incidence of major nonvertebral fracture through months 12 and 24; subject incidence of new or worsening vertebral fracture through months 12 and 24; and subject incidence of hip fracture through months 12 and 24. For all of these endpoints, the Applicant reports adjusted p-values but based on the statistical plan, hierarchal testing should have stopped after lack of significance of nonvertebral fractures. The Applicant also conducted analyses of numerous exploratory fracture endpoints, which are not discussed in this review.</p><p>Bone Mineral Density: Bone mineral density was not included in the hierarchal statistical testing. Bone mineral density of the hip and lumbar spine DXA was measured at baseline, month 12 and month 24. Analyses used an ANCOVA model adjusting for treatment, age and prevalent vertebral fracture stratification variables, baseline value, machine type, and baseline value-by-machine type interaction, without adjustment for multiplicity.</p><p>As outlined in the table below, treatment with romosozumab resulted in significant increases in both lumbar spine and hip bone mineral density. At month 12, the treatment difference is 12.7% at the lumbar spine, 5.8% at the total hip, and 5.2% at the femoral neck. From month <ref type="bibr">12 -24</ref>, treatment with open-label denosumab resulted in increases in bone mineral density in all groups. Despite the increase in BMD in the placebo group, the treatment difference remained similar (11.1% at the lumbar spine, 5.3% at the total hip, and 4.9% at the femoral neck).</p><p>Reference ID: 4123729 When subgroups including age, race, and geographic region were evaluated, changes in BMD were consistent.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">(b) (4) (b) (4)</formula><p>Reviewer Comment: The BMD endpoints were not included in the hierarchal statistical testing. Based on this, it would be reasonable not to include the BMD findings in product labeling. However, change in BMD with therapy is an important endpoint for prescribers and given the robust findings, the statistical significance would likely remain after multiplicity adjustment. Therefore, inclusion of the BMD findings in product labeling will be considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applicability of Efficacy Findings to U.S. Patients and U.S. Medical Practice:</head><p>Of the 7180 subjects enrolled in the fracture efficacy trial for romosozumab, 195 (2.7%) were from North America. Only a small number of fractures occurred in the North American population. Given the very small population enrolled, the Applicant was asked to justify the applicability of the study findings to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice. As outlined in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure  18</ref>, there was no treatment by region interaction for new vertebral fractures at month 12 (source: BLA 761062, 2.7.3 Summary of Clinical Efficacy, page 126). When lumbar spine BMD was evaluated, the BMD changes were consistent across all regions (figure 19, source: BLA 761062, 2.7.3 Summary of Clinical Efficacy, page 127). Given the consistent findings across all geographic regions, the results from study 20070337 can be considered applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions on the Substantial Evidence of Effectiveness:</head><p>The Applicant has provided substantial evidence to support one year of romosozumab therapy for treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Fracture risk reduction with romosozumab 210 mg SC administered by a healthcare provider once a month, is demonstrated in trial 20070337. Demonstration of fracture risk reduction is required for a treatment of osteoporosis indication. Morphometric vertebral fracture at month 12 and month 24 are the coprimary endpoints for trial 20070337. Morphometric vertebral fracture, an asymptomatic fracture diagnosed by radiograph, is an acceptable endpoint that has been used for most approved osteoporosis therapies. At 12 months, the new morphometric vertebral fracture absolute risk reduction was 1.3% and the relative risk reduction was 73% (p&lt;0.001) with romosozumab compared to placebo. Romosozumab was given for one year, for the second year of the trial all subjects received denosumab. At 24 months, the new morphometric vertebral fracture absolute risk reduction was 1.9% and the relative risk reduction was 75% (p&lt;0.001) with romosozumab/denosumab compared to placebo/denosumab. A significant reduction in clinical fracture was demonstrated at month 12. The clinical fracture absolute risk reduction was 1.2% and the relative risk reduction was 36% (p=0.008) with romosozumab compared to placebo. However, clinical fracture is a composite of nonvertebral and symptomatic vertebral fractures. Nonvertebral fractures make up 88% of the fractures in this composite endpoint and a significant reduction in nonvertebral fracture was not demonstrated with romosozumab therapy.</p><p>Supportive evidence is provided by the bone mineral density increases from trials <ref type="bibr">20070337, 20060326 and 20120156.</ref> In the clinical fracture trial 20070337, the treatment difference in lumbar spine BMD at month 12 was 12.7% with romosozumab. This is comparable to the lumbar spine BMD treatment difference of 11.5% observed in trial 20060326. Increases in hip BMD were also consistently observed with romosozumab therapy. In trial 20070337, the 12 month BMD romosozumab treatment difference compared to placebo was 5.8% at the total hip and 5.2% at the femoral neck. In trial 20060326, the treatment difference at 12 months was 4.9% at the total hip and 4.8% at the femoral neck.</p><p>Only 2.7% (195/7180 subjects) of the enrolled population for the fracture trial 20070337 was from North America. Therefore, a question of the applicability of the predominantly non-U.S. results to the U.S. population was raised. Evaluation of by-region treatment effect demonstrated no differences in the BMD response to romosozumab. Therefore, the results from trial 20070337 can be considered applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Safety</head><p>This integrated review of safety primarily focuses on trial 20070337, the fracture efficacy trial in which 7157 subjects were enrolled and received treatment. In addition, 12 month placebo controlled safety data is available from studies 20060326 (N=419), the phase 2 dose-finding study and 20101291 (N=252), the phase 2 dose finding study in Japanese women.</p><p>Exposure: The pooled safety population is comprised of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis or low bone mass who were enrolled in placebo-controlled trials at least 12 months in duration. This includes 7384 subjects (3689 placebo, 3695 romosozumab 210mg). Of those, 7184 subjects received at least 12 months of study drug (3305 placebo, 3879 romosozumab). This safety database exceeds the population exposure recommended in the ICH E1A guideline. Specific Safety Assessments: Special safety studies for romosozumab include assessment of immunogenicity (discussed in the clinical pharmacology/immunogenicity section of this review) and local tolerance evaluations for injection site reactions. Specific substudies of trial 20070337 included evaluation of bone histomorphometry, calcium and mineral metabolism, audiology, and osteoarthritis. Specific adverse event adjudication committees were set up for osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical femoral fractures, and cardiovascular events. Deaths: A total of 53 (24 (0.7%) placebo, 29 (0.8%) romosozumab) deaths occurred in the pooled safety population. As outlined in table 28, page 110 of the primary clinical review, the most common reason stated is death not otherwise specified occurring in 5 subjects in each group. An imbalance was noted in death due to malignant lung neoplasm, which occurred in 4 subjects in the romosozumab group and no subjects in the placebo group. Dr. Chang conducted a thorough review. All affected subjects were current or former smokers, the time to onset was short (47-132 days after first treatment of romosozumab), and the overall incidence of lung neoplasm was balanced between treatment groups. I agree with Dr. Chang that the findings should be outlined in the product label.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse Events of Interest:</head><p>Hypocalcemia: Hypocalcemia has been reported with osteoporosis therapies that inhibit bone resorption. This discussion will focus on the first year of trial 20070337 when romosozumab or placebo was given. As discussed under laboratories below, the nadir in serum calcium appears to be 1 month following romosozumab injection. In trial 20070337, no serious adverse events of hypocalcemia were reported during the first year. One adverse event of Grade 2 hypocalcemia (corrected calcium 7.0 to 8.0 mg/dL, 1.75 to 2.0 mmol/L) was reported in a romosozumab treated subject.</p><p>Patients with renal failure have altered mineral metabolism because of the underlying renal disease and the role the kidney plays for maintaining calcium and phosphorus levels. Study 34 20110227 evaluated the effect of romosozumab therapy on patients with Stage 4 (eGFR 15 -29) renal insufficiency (N=8) and subjects with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis (N=8) compared to healthy subjects (N=8). All subjects received an oral loading dose of 50,000IU vitamin D and were required to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D (amount based on the subject's baseline laboratories). No healthy subjects developed hypocalcemia. One subject in the stage 4 renal insufficiency groups developed Grade 1 hypocalcemia (corrected calcium 8.0mg/dL to LLN, or 2.0 mmol/L to LLN). Four subjects in the end stage renal disease group developed hypocalcemia, 1 subject with Grade 1 hypocalcemia, 2 subjects with Grade 2 hypocalcemia and 1 subject with Grade 3 hypocalcemia ( corrected calcium 6 -7 mg/dL; 1.5 -1.75 mmol/L).</p><p>Reviewer Comment: I agree with Dr. Chang that the issues of hypocalcemia and the need to monitor calcium levels in renal failure patients should be described in product labeling.</p><p>Hypersensitivity: The Applicant used a narrow standardized MedDRA query (SMQ) for hypersensitivity reactions. In the pooled safety population, potential hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 253 (7%) subjects in the placebo group and 249 (7%) subjects in the romosozumab group. The most common preferred terms were rash, dermatitis allergic, and eczema. When the search was narrowed to events occurring within 2 days of study drug administration, events were reported in 32 (1%) placebo subjects and 48 (1%) romosozumab subjects. The most common preferred terms were injection site rash and rash. One fatality due to circulatory collapse occurred on study day 345, 9 days after romosozumab administration. The investigator did not think this event was related to study drug as there were no reports of flushing, pruritus, or urticaria preceding the event. Serious adverse events related to hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 1 (&lt;0.1%) subjects in the placebo group and 7 (0.2) subjects in the romosozumab group. Discontinuation from the trial due to hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 2 subjects in each treatment group. Discontinuation of study drug due to potential hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 6 (0.2%) subjects in the placebo group and 11 (0.3%) in the romosozumab group.</p><p>In the pooled safety population, hypersensitivity reactions were evaluated based on antidrug antibody status. Potential hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 7% of placebo treated subjects, 7% of binding antibody negative romosozumab treated subjects and 7% binding antibody positive romosozumab treated subjects. When evaluated in term os neutralizing antibody status, potential hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 7% of placebo treated subjects, 7% of neutralizing antibody negative romosozumab treated subjects and 4% neutralizing antibody positive romosozumab treated subjects.</p><p>The potential hypersensitivity reactions reported in the pooled safety population occurred using a drug product concentration of 70 mg/mL where patients required 3 injections of 1mL each to reach the 210 mg dose. The to-be-marketed formulation of romosozumab will be the 90 mg/mL concentration, where patients will need two injections of 1.17mL each. Trial 20120156 was a 6-month trial that compared bone density changes of the romosozumab 70 mg/mL formulation and the romosozumab 90 mg/mL formulation. Potential hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 3 (6%) subjects in the placebo group, 3 (3%) subjects in the 70 mg/mL romosozumab group and 14 (11%) subjects in the 90 mg/mL romosozumab group.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The potential for hypersensitivity reactions may be more pronounced with the higher concentration of romosozumab. Injection Site Reactions: In the pooled safety population, injection site reactions occurred in 107 (3%) subjects in the placebo group and 192 (5%) subjects in the romosozumab group. There were no serious adverse events related to injection site reactions. Discontinuation from the trial due to injection site reactions occurred in 2 subjects in each treatment group. Discontinuation of study drug due to injection site reactions occurred in 2 (&lt;0.1%) subjects in the placebo group and 5 (0.1%) in the romosozumab group.</p><p>In the pooled safety population, injection site reactions were evaluated based on antidrug antibody status. Injection site reactions occurred in 3% of placebo treated subjects, 5% of binding antibody negative romosozumab treated subjects and 7% binding antibody positive romosozumab treated subjects. When evaluated in terms of neutralizing antibody status, injection site reactions occurred in 3% of placebo treated subjects, 7% of neutralizing antibody negative romosozumab treated subjects and 7% neutralizing antibody positive romosozumab treated subjects.</p><p>The injection site reactions reported in the pooled safety population occurred using a drug product concentration of 70 mg/mL where patients required 3 injections of 1mL each to reach the 210 mg dose. In trial 20120156 comparing the 70 mg/mL and the 90 mg/mL formulations, injection site reactions occurred in no subjects in the placebo group, 11 (9%) subjects in the 70 mg/mL romosozumab group and 13 (11%) subjects in the 90 mg/mL romosozumab group.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: The potential for injection site reactions may be more pronounced with the higher concentration of romosozumab or in patients who develop binding antibodies to romosozumab.</p><p>Malignant or unspecified tumors: The Wnt-beta-catenin pathway plays a role in sclerostin signaling. Wnt-beta catenin is also thought to play a role in some tumor suppressor signals. Therefore, the Applicant evaluated the sclerostin inhibitor romosozumab's potential for malignant tumors. In the pooled safety population, adverse events of malignant or unspecified tumors were reported in 71 (2%) subjects in the placebo group and 61 (2%) subjects in the romosozumab group. Serious adverse events of malignant or unspecified tumors were reported in 44 (1%) subjects in the placebo group and 39 (1%) subjects in the romosozumab group.</p><p>Inflammatory Conditions: Some literature suggests that sclerostin inhibition promotes tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated inflammatory joint disease. The Applicant constructed a MedDRA search strategy to identify events related to TNF mediated inflammation. In the pooled safety population, in subjects with a prior history of TNF mediated inflammatory disease, TNF mediated inflammatory adverse events occurred in 8 (13%) subjects in the placebo group and 5 (8%) subjects in the romosozumab group. In subjects without a prior history, TNF mediated inflammatory adverse events occurred in 6 (0.2%) subjects in the placebo group and 2 (&lt;0.1%) subjects in the romosozumab group.</p><p>Osteoarthritis: Sclerostin is expressed in articular cartilage, raising concerns that sclerostin inhibition may negatively affect articular cartilage. In the pooled safety population, adverse events of osteoarthritis were reported in 320 (9%) subjects in the placebo group and 291 (8%) subjects in the romosozumab group. Serious adverse events of osteoarthritis were reported in 17 (1%) subjects in the placebo group and 7 (0.2%) subjects in the romosozumab group.</p><p>The Applicant also conducted an osteoarthritis substudy in trial 20070337. This substudy enrolled 343 (175 placebo, 168 romosozumab) subjects. During the 12-month study, 38 subjects (25 (14%) placebo, 13 (8%) romosozumab) discontinued the study. The endpoint was change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) total score with ANCOVA using treatment, baseline WOMAC score, baseline BMI, and baseline age as independent variables. The baseline WOMAC total score was 36.68 in the placebo group and 39.38 in the romosozumab group. The LS mean change in total WOMAC score was -1.3 in the placebo group and -2.2 in the romosozumab group. Progressive worsening of knee osteoarthritis was reported in 25 (21%) placebo subjects and 21 (17%) romosozumab subjects. Osteoarthritis adverse events were reported in 12% of placebo subjects and 8% of romosozumab subjects.</p><p>Hyperostosis: Hyperostosis with adverse neurologic consequences is a feature of diseases of sclerostin overexpression (sclerosteosis and van Buchem disease). The Applicant constructed a MedDRA search strategy to identify events related to hyperostosis. In the pooled safety database, adverse events of hyperostosis were reported in 29 (1%) subjects in the placebo group and 19 (1%) subjects in the romosozumab group. Most preferred terms were related to spinal stenosis. Serious adverse events of hyperostosis were reported in 5 (1%) subjects in the placebo group and 1 (&lt;0.1%) subject in the romosozumab group.</p><p>One potential neurologic consequence of hyperostosis is hearing loss. The Applicant conducted an audiology substudy of trial 20070337 that enrolled 498 (243 placebo, 255 romosozumab) subjects. During the 12 month study, 34 subjects (18 (7%) placebo, 16 (6%) romosozumab) discontinued the study. The protocol defined hearing changes using American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) criteria. Hearing loss is defined as increase hearing threshold ≥ 20 dB at any single frequency, or loss of ≥ 10 dB at any 2 adjacent frequencies, or loss of response at 3 consecutive frequencies where responses were previously obtained. Hearing gain is defined as decrease hearing threshold ≥ 20 dB at any single frequency, or gain of ≥ 10 dB at any 2 adjacent frequencies, or loss of response at baseline but a response is obtained post-baseline at 3 consecutive frequencies. Through month 12, protocol-defined hearing loss was reported in 43/184 (23%) subjects in the placebo group and 54/209 (26%) subjects in the romosozumab group. Protocol-defined hearing gain was reported in 24/184 (19%) subjects in the placebo group and 40/209 (19%) subjects in the romosozumab group. The LS mean change in air conduction was 0.3 in the placebo group and 1.0 in the romosozumab group.</p><p>Osteonecrosis of the jaw: Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a rare adverse reaction associated with potent anti-resorptive medications. The Applicant defined ONJ as an event of interest and all potential events of ONJ identified through a predefined search of MedDRA terms were submitted to an independent external adjudication committee for review and adjudication. In the pooled safety population, no placebo subjects and one romosozumab subject had a positively adjudicated case of ONJ. In Trial 20070337, one additional subject who had received romosozumab had a positively adjudicated ONJ while undergoing denosumab therapy.</p><p>Additional adjudicated cases of ONJ were reported from ongoing trials, specifically Trial 20110142, a 24-month, randomized, active controlled fracture study evaluating treatment with romosozumab compared to alendronate. In the first 12 months of the study, subjects are randomized to romosozumab or alendronate. In the second year of the trial, all subjects receive alendronate. Both cases of ONJ occurred during the second year alendronate treatment period. One subject was on romosozumab then alendronate, the other subject was on alendronate then continued on alendronate.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: I agree with Dr. Chang that the product labeling should contain information about ONJ.</p><p>Atypical femoral fractures: Atypical femoral fracture is a rare adverse reaction associated with potent anti-resorptive medications. The Applicant defined atypical femoral fracture as an event of interest and all potential events of femoral fracture identified through a predefined search of MedDRA terms were submitted to an independent external adjudication committee for review and adjudication. In the pooled safety population, no placebo subjects and one romosozumab subject had a positively adjudicated case of atypical femoral fracture.</p><p>Additional adjudicated cases of atypical femoral fracture were reported from ongoing trials, specifically Trial 20110142. In trial 20110142, there were 5 femoral fractures sent for adjudication, four of which were positively adjudicated as atypical femoral fractures. All cases occurred in the second year alendronate treatment period. One subject was on romosozumab then alendronate; the other three subjects were on alendronate then continued on alendronate.</p><p>Reviewer Comment: I agree with Dr. Chang that the product labeling should contain information about atypical femoral fractures.</p><p>Cardiovascular Safety: Sclerostin gene SOST mRNA is expressed in the heart, aorta, liver, and kidney. Therefore, there is a concern that inhibition of sclerostin by romosozumab may promote or exacerbate vascular calcification. The Applicant has identified cardiovascular adverse events as an event of interest and all deaths and potential cardiovascular-related serious adverse events from Trial 20070337 were submitted for adjudication to an external independent committee comprised of physicians with expertise in cardiology, osteoporosis, internal medicine, or neurology. Adjudicated cardiovascular events of death (including those classified as cardiovascular and those deemed of indeterminate cause and thus included among cardiovascular deaths), cardiac ischemic event, cerebrovascular event, noncoronary revascularization, heart failure, and peripheral vascular events not requiring revascularization are summarized.</p><p>As outlined in the table below, the incidence of positively adjudicated cardiovascular serious adverse events was similar between treatment groups during the first year of the trial. Laboratories:</p><p>Calcium: Calcium levels were evaluated in the main 20070337 study as well as several substudies. The calcium substudy enrolled 1687 (854 placebo, 833 romosozumab) subjects. Approximately 9% of subjects discontinued the study. The demographic make-up of the substudy population was similar to the main study. Hypocalcemia was defined as a calcium&lt;7.5 mg/dL. At study day 14, no subjects had a calcium less than 7.5 mg/dL. Calcium corrected by albumin was also collected in the bone turnover marker substudy. As outlined in the figure below, the nadir in serum calcium seems to occur at day 14 through month 1. Calcium then returns toward baseline. The calcium decreases with denosumab in the second year of the trial are expected given the antiresorptive action of denosumab. In trial 20070337, serum calcium was evaluated at baseline and months <ref type="bibr">1 , 3, 6, 9, 11, and 12</ref> in the first year of the study. The baseline mean calcium level in both groups was 9.7 mg/dL. At month 1, the percent change was 0% in the placebo group and -2.2% in the romosozumab group.</p><p>Phosphorus: In trial 20070337, the baseline mean serum phosphorus level was 3.8 mg/dL in both treatment groups. At month 1, the percent change was 0% in the placebo group and -5.1% in the romosozumab group. Phosphorus levels remained below baseline for the remainder of romosozumab treatment, although the absolute values were in the normal range.</p><p>Parathyroid hormone: The serum iPTH and urinary calcium substudy enrolled 656 (346 placebo, 310 romosozumab) subjects. Approximately 3% of subjects discontinued the study. The demographic make-up of the substudy population was similar to the main study. The baseline median iPTH was 4.2 pmol/L in the placebo group and 4.4 pmol/L in the romosozumab group. At month 6, the median percent change in iPTH was 4% in the placebo group and 29% in the romosozumab group (nominal p-value &lt;0.001 from Wilcoxon rank-sum test without multiplicity adjustment). This increase in iPTH was maintained with the month 12 median percent change of 8% in the placebo group and 27% in the romosozumab group (nominal p-value &lt;0.001).</p><p>Liver Transaminases: The Applicant evaluated the pooled safety database for potential Hy's law cases, defined as ALT or AST &gt;3x ULN, total bilirubin &gt;2x ULN, and no other explanation for the increases. Subjects were not excluded from the studies with elevated transaminase levels. At baseline, in the pooled safety database, 6/3689 placebo subjects and 3/3695 romosozumab treated subjects had AST levels &gt;3x ULN and 10/3689 placebo subjects and 2/3694 romosozumab treated subjects had ALT levels &gt;3x ULN. On study, 29 /3612 placebo subjects and 9/3608 romosozumab subjects developed AST &gt;3x ULN and 31/3613 placebo subjects and 16/3608 romosozumab treated subjects had ALT levels &gt;3x ULN. As outlined in the clinical review pages 135 -138, Dr. Chang has carefully reviewed the data from the most concerning potential Hy's law cases and none of the cases support a liver signal with romosozumab therapy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Studies:</head><p>Bone Histomorphometry: Bone biopsies using fluorochrome labeling were obtained from 139 subjects (68 placebo/denosumab, 71 romosozumab/denosumab). A total of 154 biopsies were obtained at different timepoints during the trial. Month 2 biopsies were obtained in 34 subjects (18 placebo, 16 romosozumab); month 12 biopsies were obtained from 73 subjects <ref type="bibr">(33 placebo, 40 romosozumab)</ref>; and month 24 biopsies were obtained from 47 subjects (23 placebo/ denosumab, 24 romosozumab/denosumab). Some subjects had sequential biopsies -15 subjects had biopsies at month 12 and 24 (6 placebo/denosumab, 9 romosozumab/denosumab). Qualitatively, there was no evidence or marrow fibrosis or osteomalacia. One subject who received romosozumab then denosumab had woven bone at the iliac crest. The Applicant believes this is evidence of a microcallus and a nonpathologic process.</p><p>Histomorphometry: The month 2 cohort received quadruple fluorochrome labeling which is a fairly new technique. Subjects received double label at baseline, and then again at month 2. This technique is supposed to allow evaluation of baseline dynamic parameters (the first set of label) and then evaluation after 2 months of therapy (the second set of labels). Within-subject comparisons between baseline and month 2 showed evidence of osteoblast stimulation and osteoclast inhibition with increased bone formation rate and decreased eroded surface. The mineralizing capability of the bone did not appear compromised. The month 12 cohort received the standard double tetracycline labeling. Increased bone volume was observed in the romosozumab group compared to placebo but the dynamic bone formation parameters seen at month 2 had markedly decreased.</p><p>Cardiovascular safety, revisited: Sclerostin gene SOST mRNA is expressed in the heart, aorta, liver, and kidney. Therefore, there is a concern that inhibition of sclerostin by romosozumab may promote or exacerbate vascular calcification. The Applicant identified cardiovascular adverse events as an event of interest and is adjudicating all deaths and cardiovascular serious adverse events in their trials. The large phase 3 fracture trial did not show a cardiovascular safety signal.

The total dose requires two prefilled syringes, each containing 105mg romosozumab. The two PFS will be supplied in a single carton. The Applicant did not conduct a label comprehension study and instead is relying upon the human factors validation study from another product, brodalumab. The Division of Medication Error, Prevention and Analysis reviewed the materials provided (brodalumab labeling, brodalumab HF validation results) and did not identify any critical differences in the use of Evenity (romosozumab) PFS and brodalumab PFS. The human factors validation study results for brodalumab do not show label comprehension difficulties, use task deviations, or dosing errors concerning the need to use two prefilled syringes to administer a complete dose. Thus, the brodalumab PFS study results support the labeling comprehension of Evenity (romosozumab) PFS.</p></div>

In contrast, the BLA Study 20070337 demonstrated balanced incidence rates of CV SAEs between study groups (1.3% romosozumab versus 1.3% placebo). Preliminary efficacy analysis of Study 20110142 continue to support efficacy for romosozumab but these different and disparate safety findings between studies will have to be reviewed in detail once the Sponsor has completed final analyses of these additional studies.</p><p>The Division advised the Sponsor at the May 19, 2017 meeting to complete analysis of both Studies 20110142 and 20110174 and to submit these additional studies along with narratives and datasets to the Division for review. The Sponsor was further advised that an Advisory Committee may be needed to review the different results of the three studies. Specifically, the Division stated the following in the meeting minutes from May 19, 2017, filed with IND 100391:</p><p>"With regards to the ongoing review of BLA 761062, given these findings, the FDA explained we would not be able to take a favorable action on this review cycle.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions on the Substantial Evidence of Effectiveness 1.2.</head><p>The Sponsor demonstrated that romosozumab was effective in the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with a single study <ref type="formula" target="#formula_34">(2007337)</ref> which provided the primary evidence to support effectiveness.</p><p>Study 2007337 was a 24 month long, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in 222 centers worldwide to assess efficacy and safety of 12 months of romosozumab treatment followed by 12 months of denosumab treatment, a currently approved FDA treatment (12 months romosozumab/12 months denosumab) compared to placebo followed by 12 months of denosumab (12 months placebo/12 months denosumab) in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The co-primary endpoints were new vertebral fractures at 12 months and 24 months.</p><p>Because the Sponsor relied on only one study, the FDA required that the Sponsor meet a persuasive efficacy level of &lt;0.01 or less and that other non-pivotal studies support the results. The study demonstrated that 210 mg SQ QM romosozumab significantly reduced new vertebral fractures compared to placebo at 12 months and the effect persisted into month 24 when all subjects transitioned to denosumab. Specifically, romosozumab significantly reduced the risk of new vertebral fracture compared with placebo during the 12-month double-blind period (odds ratio = 0.27; p &lt; 0.001), with a relative risk reduction of 73% (95% CI: 53, 84). At 24 months, the relative risk reduction persisted for subjects initially randomized to romosozumab with a relative risk reduction of 75% (95% CI: 60, 84; odds ratio = 0.24, p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Study 20070337 was the only study with fracture as a primary endpoint but three placebocontrolled studies, 20060326, 20101291, and 20120156, supported the efficacy of romosozumab with primary or secondary endpoints for bone mineral density (BMD). These studies demonstrated significant BMD percentages increased when compared to placebo at the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck. Bone formation markers P1NP, osteocalcin, and BSAP and bone absorption marker, sCTX, supported the romosozumab dual functions of bone formation and suppression of bone absorption.</p><p>One caveat is that in the study 20070337, patient demographics did not reflect the US population which comprised only 2.5% of the study population. Hispanic or Latino subjects encompassed 43% of the subjects in the study. But when compared by race, ethnicity, and individual geographical, each of the groups still show significant efficacy for reducing fractures and increasing BMD at the lumbar spine, hip, and femoral neck when romosozumab is compared to placebo at 12 months and 24 months. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit-Risk Assessment</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benefit-Risk Summary and Assessment</head><p>Osteoporosis is characterized by bone loss, disruption of bone architecture, compromised strength and increase in fractures. About 10 million Americans have osteoporosis, and several times as many are at risk because of low bone density. Post-menopausal osteoporosis (PMO), the most common type, is driven primarily by the hormonal changes beginning at menopause. Caucasian women are at highest risk; about half will experience an osteoporotic fracture in their lifetime. PMO causes no symptoms until fractures, usually with minimal trauma, develop in the later stages. Fractures of the vertebrae, the most common type, weaken the spine and lead to additional fractures, with potential irreversible loss of height and function. Hip fractures frequently impair the ability to walk and to live independently. Both vertebral and hip fractures are associated with increased mortality. A variety of effective treatments is available, such that many fractures are now preventable. However, PMO remains seriously under-diagnosed and under-treated in the US, and additional treatment options are needed.</p><p>Romosozumab (EVENITY), a humanized immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) monoclonal antibody that binds and inhibits sclerostin, a regulatory factor in bone metabolism and is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Since sclerostin inhibits bone formation and stimulates bone resorption, romosozumab has a dual effect on bone by increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is also important for all postmenopausal women, especially those with osteoporosis</p><p>In a large phase 3 study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, romosozumab significantly reduced the risk of new vertebral fracture by 73% through month 12 compared with placebo with absolute risk reduction of 1.3. The risk reduction at month 12 persisted through month 24, with a 75% risk reduction after both treatment groups transitioned to antiresorptive therapy (denosumab) with absolute risk reduction of 1.9. Fewer new vertebral fractures occurred during follow-on treatment in subjects who had received romosozumab (5 fractures) compared with subjects who had received placebo (25 fractures) in the first year of study. The relative risk reductions for new vertebral fracture compare favorably with those of existing antiresorptive and bone-forming therapies. For new vertebral fracture, the treatment effects were consistent (relative risks favored romosozumab over placebo and romosozumab/denosumab over placebo/denosumab) in all subgroups of baseline characteristics examined, including age, race, geographic region, a range of baseline BMD T-scores, and subjects with a history of prior vertebral, nonvertebral, or fragility fracture. Results for bone mineral density (BMD) values were consistent across the phase 2 and phase 3 placebo-controlled studies. Romosozumab 210 mg every month (QM) demonstrated significant increases in BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck.</p><p>Although only 2.5% of patients were recruited in the large phase 3 study from patients in the US, the consistent results for vertebral fractures reduction and increased BMD among all subgroups when compared to placebo support wide applicability of romosozumab effects on new vertebral fracture reduction and extrapolation of efficacy results to the US population.</p><p>The most important safety risks identified during studies include the following: a) Atypical Femur Fracture (AFF): Since romosozumab has antiresorptive activity, as demonstrated by bone turnover markers (BTM) profiles and histomorphometry data from bone biopsies, AFF is an important potential risk for romosozumab. Atypical low-energy or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in patients receiving romosozumab. b) Osteonecrosis of Jaw (ONJ): Since romosozumab has antiresorptive activity, as demonstrated by BTM profiles and histomorphometry data from bone biopsies, ONJ is an important potential risk for romosozumab. Osteonecrosis of the jaw, which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients receiving romosozumab. c) Hypersensitivity: Like other monoclonal antibodies, romosozumab could be associated with hypersensitivity reactions. Based on medical review of the integrated safety data, hypersensitivity is considered an important identified risk with romosozumab. Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, erythema multiforme, and urticaria, occurred in the romosozumab group. d) Hypocalcemia: Inhibition of sclerostin by romosozumab leads to rapid bone mass accrual at initiation of treatment and an increased demand for bone-building substrates such as calcium. Based on the clinical trial data, hypocalcemia is considered an important identified risk. Mild and transitory decreases in albumin-corrected calcium and a compensatory increase in iPTH were observed after initiation of romosozumab Based on the totality of data, the risk of hypocalcemia is manageable with appropriate monitoring recommended for patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD).</p><p>In clinical studies, romosozumab was well tolerated except for increased injection site reactions, hypersensitivity, and hypocalcemia seen in patients with renal disease. AFF and ONJ were rare but seen in the large clinical trial in romosozumab patients.</p><p>Romosozumab reduces the risk for vertebral fractures within one year of treatment which continues once patients transition to an antiabsorptive osteoporotic drug is both a bone forming and antiabsorptive agent increases BMD at lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck. The data supports effectiveness of romosozumab for both reduction of new vertebral fractures and BMD gains at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck when compared to placebo across many subgroups and will likely have wide applicability in women with PMO. From the clinical trial data, the risks for romosozumab include AFF, ONJ, hypersensitivity, and hypocalcemia. These risks were either very rare (AFF or ONJ) or were present in few patients (hypersensitivity and hypocalcemia). These risks can be managed with labeling warnings if this drug is In summary, romosozumab is effective to reduce the risk of vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women and has qualities of bone formation and antiabsorption of bone with tolerable safety risks. The benefits to reduce new vertebral fractures in PMO outweigh the safety risks. This drug has a place in the armamentarium of treatments against osteoporosis in post-menopausal women if approved.</p></div>

BMD gains were maintained or augmented further in studies that included a transition to antiresorptive therapy (denosumab) after completion of romosozumab.</p><p>• Romosozumab consistently increased BMD at the lumbar spine and total hip regardless of baseline BMD T-scores, age, and geographic region.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risk</head><p>• Atypical Femur Fracture (AFF): Since romosozumab has antiresorptive activity, as demonstrated by bone turnover markers (BTM) profiles and histomorphometry data from bone biopsies, AFF is an important potential risk for romosozumab. Atypical low-energy or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in patients receiving romosozumab.</p><p>• Osteonecrosis of Jaw (ONJ): Since romosozumab has antiresorptive AFF is a risk with romosozumab as it was reported in the clinical trials but it is rare.</p><p>ONJ is a risk with romosozumab as it was reported in the clinical trials but it is rare. • Hypersensitivity: Like other monoclonal antibodies, romosozumab could be associated with hypersensitivity reactions. Based on medical review of the integrated safety data, hypersensitivity is considered an important identified risk with romosozumab. Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, erythema multiforme, and urticaria, occurred in the romosozumab group. No anaphylaxis was reported in the clinical trials.</p><p>• Hypocalcemia: Inhibition of sclerostin by romosozumab leads to rapid bone mass accrual at initiation of treatment and an increased demand for bone-building substrates such as calcium. Based on the clinical trial data, hypocalcemia is considered an important identified risk. Mild and transitory decreases in albumin-corrected calcium and a compensatory increase in iPTH were observed after initiation of romosozumab. Based on the totality of data, the risk of hypocalcemia is manageable with appropriate monitoring recommended for patients with stage 5 CKD.</p><p>Hypersensitivity is a risk as it was reported in the clinical trials but it was relatively rare.</p><p>Hypocalcemia is a risk as it was seen in the clinical trials, mostly in renal failure patients. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dimension Evidence and Uncertainties Conclusions and Reasons</head><p>• Hyperostosis: The intended pharmacologic effect of romosozumab is an increase in BMD and bone strength; however, hyperostosis (excessive bone growth) may be a potential risk with romosozumab administration. The current data, including the audiology substudy, do not support a safety risk of hyperostosis with romosozumab use; however, given the mechanism of action for romosozumab, it is considered a potential risk. The data does not support a safety risk for hyperostosis with romosozumab.</p><p>Hyperostosis is a theoretical risk but the clinical trials did not support this risk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risk Management</head><p>• AFF, ONJ, hypersensitivity and hypocalcemia risks can be managed by labeling • REMS level risks were not identified during the review.</p><p>The risks for AFF and ONJ can be managed with labeling as the numbers of cases were rare and all were confounded.

Romosozumab is administered once monthly (QM) and has a rapid onset of effect, thus offering an important additional treatment option for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk for fracture. These patients will benefit from rapid fracture risk reduction, significant BMD gains, and improved underlying skeletal strength for ongoing fracture risk reduction with follow-on antiresorptive therapy. The following table 1 summarizes the major pharmacologic treatments for osteoporosis. The following table 2 lists the absolute and relative risk reductions (ARR, RRR) in new morphometric vertebral fractures (the primary endpoint) in the PMO trials of approved drugs. Risk reductions were generally apparent within 1 or 2 years and maintained through 3 years (the Forteo trial was stopped at ~19 months for safety concerns -see below). Because the trial populations differed in baseline fracture risk, ARR is highly variable between drugs/trials while RRR is more consistent. For example, the FIT-1 trial of Fosamax enrolled a high risk population (women with baseline vertebral fractures) and FIT-2 a lower risk population (no baseline fractures); fracture rates in both treatment groups were much higher in FIT-1, but relative reduction in fracture risk was nearly identical in the two studies.   for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) ARR = Absolute Risk Reduction; RRR= Relative Risk Reduction *Forteo trial = 19 months' median exposure **Fosamax FIT-2 trial = 48 month assessment Sources: Prescribing information <ref type="figure">(Forteo, RIS, ZOL, DEN, RAL)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Lancet 1996</ref><ref type="bibr">,348:1535</ref><ref type="bibr">JBMR 2004</ref><ref type="bibr">, 19:1241</ref> Reviewer <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Comments: There are a number of drugs available for osteoporosis treatment.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanism of Action 4.5.1.</head><p>Romosozumab (formerly known as AMG 785) is a humanized immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) monoclonal antibody that binds and inhibits sclerostin. Romosozumab increases bone formation due to the activation of bone lining cells, increased bone matrix production by osteoblasts, and recruitment of osteoprogenitor cells. The following figure 2 illustrates the mechanism of action for romosozumab in bone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2: Graphic Representation of Mechanism of Action for Romosozumab</head><p>Source: Clinical Overview <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">Figure 2</ref> with reviewer edits.</p><p>Additionally, romosozumab results in changes to expression of osteoclast mediators, thereby decreasing bone resorption. Together, this dual-effect of increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption results in rapid increases in trabecular and cortical bone mass, improvements in bone structure and strength, and fracture risk reduction.</p></div>

For a given dose, QM administration provided significantly greater BMD gains at lumbar spine and total hip than every 3 months (Q3M) administration, while BMD gains were similar for QM and Q3M dosing of the same cumulative dose (eg, 70 mg QM versus 210 mg Q3M). Model predicted time courses for the QM dose regimens indicated that the 210 mg dose provided the most rapid and extensive gains in BMD over the course of 12-month treatment.</p><p>The concentration-response model adequately described the relationship between romosozumab concentration, bone turnover markers (P1NP and sCTX), and BMD gains at the lumbar spine. Out of the dosing regimens studied, the highest BMD gains at 12 months were observed for 210 mg SC QM. The greatest increase in the bone formation marker P1NP, and the longest duration of P1NP increase above baseline were also obtained with the 210 mg SC QM dosing regimen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments: The Sponsor selected 210 mg QM, the highest dose, based on PD studies which demonstrated that romosozumab 210 mgs QM provided greater BMD gains at the lumbar spine and total hip than Q3M (i.e. 210 mg QM had greater BMD gains compared to 210 mg Q3M) and bone formation marker, P1NP, had the greatest increase and longest sustained increase above baseline at this dose.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunogenicity</head><p>In the phase 2 and phase 3 clinical studies of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, the incidence of binding and neutralizing antidrug antibodies (ADAs) was 19.9% (852 of 4289) and 1.1% (46 of 4289), respectively. The incidence of binding and neutralizing ADAs in women dosed with 210 mg QM was similar to the overall studies at 19.1% (758 of 3959) and 0.8% (31 of 3959), respectively. The presence of binding ADAs appeared to decrease romosozumab exposure up to 25% at months 3, 6, and 9. The exposures became comparable at month 12 (difference in mean values was approximately 10%) between ADA positive and ADA negative subjects. The concentration values were within the range of subjects in whom no ADAs were detected. Additionally, population PK analysis showed that the presence of ADAs did not impact on the PK of romosozumab. For subjects who received romosozumab, the percent change from baseline in BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck at month 12 and month 24 was compared among subjects who developed binding or neutralizing antiromosozumab antibodies through month 15 versus those who were negative for antiromosozumab antibodies through month 15.</p><p>At month 12, the mean percent changes in BMD at the lumbar spine were 13.1% (negative antibody status), 13.1% (positive binding antiromosozumab antibody), and 11.6% (positive neutralizing antiromosozumab antibody). Corresponding values at month 24 were 16.7%, 16.7%, and 15.1%, respectively. Percent change from baseline at the total hip and femoral neck also showed consistent results The following table 3 summarizes BMD at lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck at month 12 and month 24 by ADA status at month 15 for patients in study 20070337.  When administered to healthy subjects at single SC doses ranging from 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg, romosozumab exhibited nonlinear PK. At low doses, mean apparent clearance (CL/F) was approximately 4-fold higher at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg than at 3 mg/kg. At higher doses, between 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, the PK appeared to be linear, based on relatively similar clearance and dose-normalized maximum serum concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUCinf). Generally, Cmax was observed within the first week after administration. Serum romosozumab concentrations declined with a mean half-life (t1/2) of approximately 11 to 18 days during the beta (plateau) phase and 6-7 days during the gamma (terminal) phase. The bioavailability of romosozumab was estimated to be 50% to 70% after SC administration of 1 to 5 mg/kg.</p></div>

The mean effective t1/2 was 12.8 days after 3 doses of 3 mg/kg. Approximately linear PK was observed when comparing Cmax and AUC values following 2 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg Q4W. When multiple SC doses of romosozumab 70 mg, 140 mg, or 210 mg QM were administered to postmenopausal women with osteoporosis or low BMD, steady state was generally reached by month 3 with minimal accumulation (&lt; 2 fold) following multiple doses and maintained at a similar level throughout the rest of the study. Ctrough was approximately dose proportional from 140 mg to 210 mg, however a more than dose-proportional increase in Ctrough was observed from 70 mg to 140 mg.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacokinetics in Patients With Renal Impairment</head><p>Because of the large molecular weight of romosozumab, renal clearance was not expected to play a role in the total clearance of romosozumab. However, chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been implicated with disturbances of the Wnt pathway with an elevated level of serum sclerostin reported in CKD subjects. A phase 1 study (Study 20110227) was conducted in healthy subjects and subjects with stage 4 renal impairment or stage 5 CKD requiring hemodialysis, to investigate the PK, PD, and safety of romosozumab in subjects with renal impairment where subjects received a single dose of 210 mg SC Results from Study 20110227 showed the exposure of romosozumab for subjects with stage 4 renal impairment was 44% higher than for subjects with normal renal function.</p><p>The population PK analysis indicated an increase in romosozumab AUC with increasing severity of renal impairment with about a 50% increase in predicted median AUC in subjects with endstage renal disease (assuming no hemodialysis during romosozumab treatment).

Specifically, this renal failure study demonstrated there was  a 50% increase in predicted median AUC, but the upper limits (95%) was still 50% below the  maximum exposure found in single-dose phase 1 studies of 10 mg/kg. Patients had higher  rates of elevated iPTH and hypocalcemia and AEs related to hypocalcemia when compared to  the general population. See section 8.3.8 laboratories for details.</ref> The increased rates of hypocalcemia and AEs related to hypocalcemia in this renal failure patient population should be addressed in the labeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacokinetics in Patients With Hepatic Impairment</head><p>Because romosozumab is a monoclonal antibody and is not eliminated via hepatic metabolic mechanisms (eg, by cytochrome P450 [CYP] enzymes), hepatic impairment and drug interaction studies (eg, with CYP inhibitors) were not considered necessary and have therefore not been conducted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments: Because romosozumab, a monoclonal antibody, is not eliminated by the hepatic metabolic mechanisms, it is acceptable for the Sponsor not to conduct hepatic impairment studies.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Population Pharmacokinetics</head><p>Population PK and PK/PD analyses in healthy subjects and postmenopausal women with low BMD or osteoporosis were performed using non-linear mixed effects modeling method and characterized absorption, distribution, and elimination of romosozumab. The key findings from the population PK analyses were the following:</p><p>• After SC administration of 210 mg romosozumab, bioavailability was high (81%) and absorption was complete in approximately 14 days. Bioavailability is nonlinear at lower doses but at higher doses such as 210 mg, it is linear. The rate of absorption was similar across the range of doses evaluated.</p><p>• Romosozumab is eliminated through a slow nonspecific elimination pathway mediated by the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (ie, linear clearance [CL]), and a rapid saturable elimination pathway (ie, target-mediated nonlinear clearance) mediated by degradation of romosozumab-sclerostin complex in the peripheral compartments, which results in a concentration dependent clearance of romosozumab.</p><p>• Sclerostin is &gt; 95% bound for the entire dosing interval for a 210-mg SC QM regimen which suggests full target-engagement has been achieved.</p><p>• There were no differences in romosozumab PK between healthy subjects or postmenopausal women with low BMD or osteoporosis. Prior alendronate or postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment, presence of antiromosozumab antibodies (antidrug antibodies [ADAs]), and baseline sclerostin had no impact on PK. • Body weight, age, gender, race (Japanese versus non-Japanese), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), were identified as having an impact on PK. The effect of body weight (on both clearance and volume) and eGFR (on clearance) had the greatest impact, with decreasing body weight or decreasing eGFR resulting in increasing romosozumab exposure. However PK/PD modeling demonstrated body weight and eGFR had minimal impact on BMD gain at 12 months, with gains in BMD over a weight range of 43 to 86 kg or across stages of renal impairment comparable (±15%) to a typical subject. Additionally, predicted exposures (95% upper bound) after 210 mg QM dosing in the lowest body weight subjects included in the analysis (&lt; 43 kg) or subjects with end-stage renal disease (eGFR &lt; 15 mL/min) were approximately 60% and 50% lower respectively than the exposure obtained with a 10 mg/kg dose, which was demonstrated to be tolerated in clinical studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments: The Sponsor used PK/ PD modeling to determine that dose adjustment is not necessary for patient baseline characteristics which have impact on PK. Although low body weight and low eGFR had the greatest impact on increasing romosozumab exposure, PK/PD modeling demonstrated that these factors had minimal impact on BMD gain at 12</head><p>months and that the maximum exposure will still be less than the maximum tolerable dose (10 mg/ kg).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trial Design</head><p>This was a multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallelgroup study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, defined as low BMD at the total hip or femoral neck. Subjects were randomized 1:1 (stratified by age group [&lt; 75 years, ≥75 years] and prevalent vertebral fracture) to receive romosozumab 210 mg subcutaneously (SC) every month (QM) or matched placebo SC QM for 12 months, after which both groups received openlabel denosumab 60 mg every 6 months (Q6M) for an additional 12 months, blinded to initial treatment assignment. This 24-month primary analysis period (12 months of double-blind romosozumab or placebo followed by 12 months of open-label denosumab) was followed by a 12-month open-label extension period through month 36 (currently ongoing) in which eligible subjects continued to receive denosumab 60 mg Q6M. The current marketing application contains information for only the 24-month primary analysis period and does not contain information for the extension period through month 36.</p><p>The study included 10 substudies: Three substudies which include bone turnover markers (BTM) &amp; biomarker substudy and two imaging substudies are discussed in section 6. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of Subjects Planned: Approximately 6600</head><p>Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Eligibility: Subjects included postmenopausal women age 55 to 90 years with a BMD T-score at the total hip or femoral neck of ≤-2.50. Key exclusion criteria included a BMD T-score of ≤ -3.50 at the total hip or femoral neck, a hip fracture at any time, any severe or more than 2 moderate vertebral fractures, severe metabolic or bone diseases, and significant laboratory abnormalities. There were no prevalent fracture inclusion criteria and no adjustment to higher BMD inclusion criteria for prevalent fractures.</p><p>The use of agents affecting bone metabolism was also exclusionary; however, for selected therapies permissible off-treatment periods were allowed before randomization. For example, prior oral bisphosphonate therapy was allowed with the following limits:</p><p>• any dose received within 3 months prior to randomization • more than 1 month of cumulative use between 3 and 12 months prior to randomization • more than 3 years of cumulative use, unless last dose received ≥ 5 years prior to randomization For IV bisphosphonates, the limits included:</p><p>• Zoledronic acid: -any dose received within 3 years prior to randomization -more than 1 dose received within 5 years prior to randomization • IV ibandronate or IV pamidronate: -any dose received within 12 months prior to randomization -more than 3 years of cumulative use, unless last dose received ≥ 5 years prior to randomization</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Investigational Products, Dose and Mode of Administration</head><p>Investigational Product: Romosozumab 210 mg SC QM or matched placebo SC QM followed by denosumab 60 mg SC Q6M.</p><p>Other Therapy: Daily calcium and vitamin D supplementation, that at a minimum was to be in the range of 500 to 1000 mg elemental calcium and 600 to 800 IU vitamin D. An initial loading dose of 50 000 to 60 000 IU vitamin D within 1 week after randomization was also administered, based on serum 25 hydroxy (OH) vitamin D concentration at screening for subjects with the following process: subjects with a serum 25 (OH) vitamin D level of ≥ 20 ng/mL and ≤ 40 ng/mL at screening received an initial loading dose of 50,000 to 60,000 IU vitamin D after randomization. Subjects with a serum 25 (OH) vitamin D level of &gt; 40 ng/mL at screening may also receive the vitamin D loading dose at the principal investigator's discretion. Subjects with serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels &lt; 20 ng/ mL were excluded. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Duration of Treatment:</head><p>The primary analysis period included a 24-month study period that consisted of 12 months of double-blind treatment with romosozumab or placebo, followed by 12 months of open-label treatment with denosumab. After the 24-month study period, eligible subjects who entered the extension period received an additional 12 months of openlabel treatment with denosumab, for a total treatment period of 36 months. This application only contained information to the end of the 24 month study period and does not contain information for the extension from month 24 to month 36.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fracture Analysis and Definitions:</head><p>At baseline/ screening, a single, central imaging center radiologist determined prevalent vertebral fractures on lateral-spine X-rays using the following Genant visual semiquantitative grading (SQ) scale:</p><p>• SQ grade 0 (SQ0) = no fracture • SQ grade 1 (SQ1) = mild fracture, 20 to 25% reduction in vertebral height (anterior, middle, or posterior) • SQ grade 2 (SQ2) = moderate fracture, 25 to 40% reduction in height • SQ grade 3 (SQ3) = severe fracture, greater than 40% reduction in height</p><p>For incident fractures, the following listing defines each fracture type:  New vertebral fractures occurred when there was ≥ 1 grade increase from the previous grade of 0 in any vertebra from T4 to L4 on the Genant SQ Scoring scale. All readers will be from the central imaging center. A primary reader will review radiographs as received. If a new vertebral fracture is identified, the second reader will assess the results blinded to the first reader's findings. activity restrictions during the study and after nonvertebral or clinical vertebral fractures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis Plan</head><p>A fixed-sequence testing procedure was used for multiplicity adjustment of the coprimary and a subset of secondary efficacy endpoints to maintain the overall significance level at 0.05. If the testing sequence was stopped at a particular step, the remaining endpoints in the testing sequence were not formally tested for statistical significance, and the corresponding p-values were considered descriptive. The following figure 3 graphs this pre-specified fixed-sequence testing for fracture endpoints (see definitions of fractures in the section above). The p-values for the analyses of other secondary, exploratory, and substudy endpoints were nominal without adjusting for multiplicity. All p-values were 2-sided.</p><p>Coprimary Endpoints: The primary analysis set for vertebral fractures was used for analyses of subject incidence of new vertebral fracture through month 12 and through month 24. The number and percentage of subjects with new vertebral fracture was summarized by treatment group. The significance of the treatment effect between romosozumab and placebo (month 12) and romosozumab/denosumab and placebo/denosumab (month 24) was assessed using a logistic regression model with treatment as the main effect and age and prevalent vertebral fracture strata as covariates. The odds ratio, corresponding 95% confidence interval, and pvalue of the score test were provided. Statistical significance for the coprimary endpoints was declared if the p-values for testing the treatment effects through month 12 and month 24 were both &lt; 0.05. Point estimates of absolute risk reduction (difference in proportions, controltreatment), risk ratio (ratio of proportions, treatment over control), and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals were also calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method adjusting for age and prevalent vertebral fracture strata.</p><p>Secondary Fracture Endpoints: Analyses of new or worsening vertebral fractures and multiple new or worsening vertebral fractures were performed on the primary analysis set using the logistic regression analysis described for the coprimary endpoints. For other fracture endpoints, a time-to-event analysis was used on the full analysis set. In this analysis, the cumulative incidence of fractures was summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimates.</p><p>The significance of the treatment effect between romosozumab and placebo (month 12) or romosozumab/denosumab and placebo/denosumab (month 24) was assessed using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model that controlled for age and prevalent vertebral fracture strata and had treatment as the independent variable. The estimated hazard ratio, corresponding 95% confidence interval, and the p-value of the score test were provided. Point estimate of the adjusted risk difference (difference in Kaplan-Meier estimates, control arm -treatment arm) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval were also provided using the inverse varianceweighted method. Adjusted p-values based on the testing sequence for secondary fracture endpoints were provided in addition to the nominal p-values from the statistical tests.</p><p>Subgroup Analyses: Subgroups analyses were performed for new vertebral fracture, clinical fracture, and nonvertebral fracture at months 12 and 24 using subgroup categories of age &lt; 65 and ≥ 65 years, age &lt; 75 and ≥ 75 years, prevalent vertebral fracture status (yes, no), history of fragility fracture (yes, no), history of nonvertebral fracture at age ≥ 55 years (yes, no), race (white, non-white), geographic region (Western Europe and Australia/New Zealand, Central and Eastern Europe; Asia Pacific; North America; and Central/Latin America), baseline lumbar spine BMD T-score (≤ -3, &gt; -3 and ≤-2.5, &gt; -2.5), baseline total hip or femoral neck BMD T-score ≤-3 vs both total hip and femoral neck BMD T-score &gt; -3, baseline body mass index (BMI) (tertiles), and World Health Organization Fracture Risk Assessment tool (FRAX) score for major osteoporotic fracture (tertiles). The treatment-by-subgroup interaction was tested quantitatively. If the p-value for the quantitative interaction was ≤ 0.05, qualitative interaction testing was performed.</p><p>Bone Mineral Density Endpoints: The primary efficacy analysis set for BMD (month 12 and month 24) was used for analyses of percent change from baseline in BMD. The treatment comparisons of the BMD in lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck at months 12 and 24 were analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation as the primary analysis. The ANCOVA model included treatment, age and prevalent vertebral fracture strata, and baseline value of the endpoint. Additional covariates of machine type and machine type-by-baseline value interaction were also included. Least squares mean of the treatment difference (treatment -control), the corresponding 95% confidence interval, and p-value were used to compare treatments at each time point.</p><p>The following <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 5</ref> summarizes statistical methods for the fracture endpoints of study 20070337: Safety Endpoints: The safety analysis set was used for the safety analyses. Subject incidence of all treatment-emergent adverse events (hereafter referred to as adverse events) was tabulated by system organ class and preferred term according to the treatment actually received. Adjudicated events of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) and atypical femoral fracture (AFF) were summarized by number of events and subject incidence. Adjudicated cardiovascular events were summarized as subject incidence.</p><p>Laboratory tests were also summarized over time by actual value and change from baseline for all tests, and also by percent change from baseline for select laboratory tests. Laboratory tests were summarized using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) shift tables of the baseline to the worst post baseline grade. The numbers and percentages of subjects exhibiting antiromosozumab antibodies (baseline and months <ref type="bibr">1, 3, 6, 12, 15, and 24)</ref> and antidenosumab antibodies (months 12 and 24) were tabulated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol Amendments</head><p>The following table 6 summarizes important changes to study design 20070337 during development. A coprimary objective was added to assess the effect of romosozumab treatment for 12 months followed by denosumab treatment for 12 months compared with placebo followed by denosumab treatment on the subject incidence of new vertebral fracture. This change was made following discussions with the Agency after the 19 August 2011 EOP2 Meeting (Amgen Response to Questions submitted 07 February 2012, SN 0139), The eligibility criteria were modified to allow participation of a wider range of patients. Specifically, the minimum age was lowered from 60 to 55 years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Changes in inclusion and/or exclusion criteria</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample size modification</head><p>20070337 Protocol Amendment 1</p><p>(30 August 2012)</p><p>The number of subjects enrolled was increased from 5,600 to 6,000 to ensure enough power to assess the effect of treatment regimens on reduction in non-vertebral fractures at the end of 24 months. The sample size was modified based on the new assumption that the incidence rate of new vertebral and nonvertebral fracture in the placebo group was 12.5% lower than the original assumptions. Using the revised assumption of in the placebo group, the sample size for the study was increased to 6600 subjects. The sample size was increased twice to insure enough patients to achieve enough power with the addition of the co-primary endpoint at 24 months and because the rate of non-vertebral fractures was 12.5% lower than the original assumptions. Age limit was lowered from age 60 to 55 in order to allow more patients into the study. Together these changes allowed the study to recruit enough subjects to complete the study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient Disposition</head><p>The study was conducted globally at 222 centers in 25 countries: 31 centers in Central/Latin America (43% of randomized subjects), 51 centers in Central and Eastern Europe (29 % of randomized subjects), 52 centers in Western Europe and Australia/New Zealand (14 % of randomized subjects), 62 centers in Asia Pacific (12 % of randomized subjects) and 26 centers in North America (3% of randomized subjects). Countries that randomized more than 10% of subjects included Colombia (25 %), Poland (17 %), and Brazil <ref type="bibr">(11 %)</ref>.</p><p>A total of 16,716 subjects were screened for the study and 7180 were randomized to the romosozumab 210 mg (3589 subjects) and placebo (3591 subjects) groups. The following two tables 8 and 9 summarize subject disposition in study 20070337 for the double blind period through month 12 (table 8) and through the extension period where all patients were treated with denosumab to month 24 (table 9).  Eighty-nine percent of enrolled subjects completed the 12-month double-blind period (romosozumab, 89%; placebo, 89%) and 84 % of subjects completed the 24-month study period (romosozumab/denosumab, 83 %; placebo/denosumab, 84 %). Throughout the study, withdrawn consent was the most frequently reported reason for withdrawal from study in both treatment groups (romosozumab, 7 %; placebo, 7 % during 12-month double-blind period and romosozumab/denosumab, 10 %; placebo/denosumab, 9 % during the 24-month study period).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol Violations/Deviations</head><p>A total of 254 (4 %) subjects had at least 1 important protocol deviation (including eligibility criteria deviations that were considered important) during the 24-month study period. The most frequently reported important protocol deviations pertained to subjects who missed &gt; 3 doses of romosozumab or placebo during the double-blind period (1 % of subjects in the romosozumab group and 2 % of subjects in the placebo group). Of the 34 (0.5%) subjects who received an incorrect box for romosozumab or placebo during double-blind treatment, 14 (0.2%) received investigational product that did not match the subject's randomized treatment group. Six of these subjects were randomized to placebo and received a dose of romosozumab in error during the double-blind period. Therefore, these 6 subjects were included in the placebo group (ie, as randomized) for efficacy analyses, but in the romosozumab group (ie, as treated) for safety analyses. During review, the Office of Scientific Investigator (OSI) noted that one of the sites, Dr. Jose FM Restrepo (Site # 1-678YLY/68007) in Columbia had a major issue of delayed randomization. The Sponsor was asked to report randomization times for study 20070337. The Sponsor reported that a total of 7% (481 patients) of the subjects enrolled in Study 20070337 had a screening duration &gt; 35 days and 1.3% (95 patients) exceeded 70 days in total screening duration. Of the subjects with a screening period longer than 70 days, the majority were between 71 and 79 days, with few subjects exceeding 90 days. The longer screening duration was predominantly observed in the Latin American region, specifically at 2 sites in Columbia.</p><p>Although required by the protocol, most subjects with a long screening period did not have repeat testing performed prior to randomization. The Sponsor examined these subjects' screening, and as applicable, baseline or on-study spinal X-rays, calcium, and vitamin D values as a surrogate for prior-to-randomization values to ensure that subjects did not have a severe fracture (or more than 2 moderate fractures), hypo-or hypercalcemia, or excessively low vitamin D levels that would have deemed them ineligible to participate. Subject listings confirm that all subjects met X-ray and vitamin D eligibility criteria and only 1 did not meet calcium eligibility criteria-with grade 1 hypercalcemia at screening and baseline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments: Although there was 7% screening delay &gt; 35 days and the majority of the patients with &gt; 70 days screening delayed were not rescreened, patient eligibility did not appear to have been affected by the delays.</head><p>Other important protocol deviations (entered study even though entry criteria were not satisfied, missed month 12 or end of treatment lateral spine X-ray, had a calcium level below the lower limit of normal at month 11 or month 11 + 14 days and was not withdrawn, received an excluded concomitant medication) were each reported for &lt; 1.0% of subjects in either treatment group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments: The low incidences and balanced protocol deviations between treatment groups do not raise concern about protocol</head><p>deviations affecting interpretation of the study results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table of Demographic Characteristics and Other Baseline Characteristics</head><p>Demographic characteristics were generally balanced between the 2 treatment groups. All enrolled subjects were women as required by the inclusion criteria. Overall, 57 % of randomized subjects were white and 40 % were Hispanic or Latino. The mean age of study subjects was 70.9 years (range: 55 to 90 years), and 31 % of subjects were ≥ 75 years of age at enrollment. Body composition of the study subjects included mean (SD) weight of 57.94 (10.96) kg, mean (SD) height of 153.2 (7.3) cm, and mean (SD) BMI of 24.70 (4.36) kg/m2. <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">Table  10</ref> summarizes the demographic characteristics in Study 20070337. Baseline laboratory parameters were balanced between the 2 treatment groups including mean baseline albumin-adjusted calcium, phosphorus, and creatinine. Glomerular filtration rate was ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for the majority of subjects (81 %). 99.7% of subjects had baseline serum concentrations of 25 (OH) vitamin D ≥ 20 ng/mL. A minority of subjects (7 %) had used osteoporosis medications with oral bisphosphonates the most frequently reported prior osteoporosis medication (5 % of subjects). 99% of subjects reported baseline concomitant medication of calcium and vitamin D concomitant use was reported for concomitant medication. 77 % (5550 subjects) of subjects started with an initial loading dose of 50,000 to 60,000 IU vitamin D at baseline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments: Baseline demographics between the two treatment groups were similar at baseline for age, vital signs, and medical histories.</head><p>Spine radiographs showed that 18 % of subjects had at least 1 verified prevalent vertebral fracture at baseline and 22 % subjects had a history of nonvertebral fracture at or after age 45. The study had excluded patients with any prevalent severe vertebral fractures or more than 2 moderate vertebral fractures. The following table 11 summarizes prevalent fracture history of subjects. The mean baseline lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck BMD T-scores were -2.72, -2.47, and -2.75, respectively. Baseline characteristics relevant to determination of the 10-year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture, according to the WHO Fracture Risk Assessment tool (FRAX), were similar between treatment groups. The mean 10-year probabilities of major osteoporotic fractures and of hip fractures calculated with femoral neck BMD were 13.4 % (range: 2.7% to 69.7%) and 5.9% (range: 0.3% to 57.9%), respectively. Baseline cardiovascular risk factors (age, smoking history, and history of hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease) were also similar between the 2 treatment groups. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments: The demographics was well balanced between groups in both major characteristics and laboratory parameters which is reflective of the quality of randomization but there were demographic differences which are significant weaknesses of the trial when extrapolating the results to the US population.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>This study was conducted mostly out of the US and the race demographics differ significantly from the US population. 43% of the subjects were enrolled from Latin America and 29% were from Eastern/Central Europe while only 3 % of the subjects were enrolled from the US. There is higher enrollment of Hispanics and lower enrollment of Blacks when comparing the study demographics to the US population.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>There is evidence that the predominance of South American/ Hispanic subjects enrolled in this trial affected the sample size as there were fewer new vertebral fractures found in this population than predicted. Under a protocol amendment, the sample size was increased in order to reach statistical power for the primary endpoints because this predominant population had fewer fractures than anticipated. However, the baseline prevalent vertebral fracture history is well balanced between the treatment and placebo groups (19% romosozumab versus 18% placebo patients) which support extrapolation of the study results to the US population.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment Compliance, Concomitant Medications, and Rescue Medication Use</head><p>The investigational product (romosozumab or matched placebo PFS and denosumab PFS) was not dispensed to the subjects; all romosozumab, placebo, and denosumab injections were administered by authorized healthcare professionals at the study centers, and were documented on the eCRF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concomitant medications included calcium and vitamin D supplementation for all subjects.</head><p>Rescue medication -No rescue medications for osteoporosis were planned for the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments: Of note, on a search of the database for concomitant medications during the double-blinded period, 15 patients on romosozumab and 12 patients in the placebo group started on a variety of osteoporotic medications, mostly bisphosphonates. 2 patients started on strontium renelate (1 in romosozumab, 1 in placebo) and 2 patients in the romosozumab group each started on a SERM or teriparatide.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Results -Primary Endpoint</head><p>In Study 20070337, the pivotal phase 3 study, romosozumab significantly reduced the incidence of new vertebral fractures compared with placebo through month 12 (p &lt; 0.001), with a relative risk reduction of 73% (95% CI: 53%, 84%) and absolute risk reduction by % of 1.30 (95% CI: 0.79, 1.80). In addition, in subjects who received romosozumab during the first year, reduction in fracture risk persisted through the second year in subjects who transitioned from romosozumab to denosumab compared with those who transitioned from placebo to denosumab (p &lt; 0.001), with a relative risk reduction of 75% (95% CI: 60%, 84%) and absolute risk reductions by % of 1.89 (95% CI: 1.30, 2.49) at month 24.</p><p>Fewer new vertebral fractures occurred during follow-on treatment in subjects who had received romosozumab compared with subjects who had received placebo in the first year of study (5 versus 25 fractures in the second year, respectively) even though both arms were receiving denosumab during the second year.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subgroup analysis for co-primary endpoints:</head><p>A consistent treatment effect was found across all subgroups for the coprimary endpoints of vertebral fracture at 12 and 24 months. No significant quantitative interactions were detected through month 12 or through month 24 for any subgroup of baseline characteristics examined (age, prevalent vertebral fracture status, race, geographic region, baseline lumbar spine BMD Tscore, baseline total hip/femoral neck BMD T-score, baseline BMI, FRAX score, history of nonvertebral fracture at or after age 55, and history of fragility fracture). All p-values on tests of quantitative interactions were &gt; 0.05; therefore, no relevant treatment-by-subgroup interactions (quantitative or qualitative) were identified through month 12 or through month 24 for any subgroup. Efficacy was evaluated by combining all results from all centers. No centers were removed from the analysis because of potential fraudulent data.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments: Clinical fractures through 24 months did NOT meet clinical significance when adjusted for multiplicity as expected. The Sponsor performed subgroup analysis on clinical and nonvertebral fractures, discussed below.</head><p>Clinical Fracture Subgroup Analysis: The subgroup analyses of clinical fracture and nonvertebral fracture through month 12 showed a significant quantitative interaction by geographical region (p = 0.029 and p = 0.042, respectively). The nonvertebral component of clinical fractures (defined as nonvertebral fractures plus symptomatic vertebral fractures) accounted for more than 85% of clinical fractures. Nonvertebral subgroup analysis through 12 months by region showed that the Central/Latin American fracture rates were lower than expected (3.5%) with observed rates in placebo (1.2%) and no reduction in the romosozumab group (1.5%). Central/ Latin America accounted for 43% of the randomized population.</p><p>The Sponsor performed a post hoc subgroup analysis to examined Central/Latin America separately from all other regions combined (ie, rest-of-world). Through 12 months, the nonvertebral fracture rate was 2.7% in the placebo group (closer to the expected rate of 3.5%) and 1.6% in the romosozumab group (relative risk reduction 42% [95% CI <ref type="bibr">: 11, 63]</ref>, nominal p = 0.012 post hoc). Through month 24, the rest-of-world nonvertebral fracture rate was 4.3% in the placebo group and 2.9% in the romosozumab group (relative risk reduction 33% [95% CI: 7, 52], p = 0.016.</p><p>Baseline characteristic by region showed a lower height, lower prevalence of historical nonvertebral fractures, and lower World Health Organization Fracture Risk Assessment tool (FRAX) 10-year probabilities of major osteoporotic/ hip fractures in the Central/ Latin American population.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments: The large proportion of the study population from Central/ Latin</head><p>America (43%) had regional differences with lower rates of fractures than expected when compared to the rest of the world for nonvertebral fractures. These regional differences influenced the overall fracture endpoints for nonvertebral fractures through 12 months, 24 months and clinical fractures at 24 months such that none of these fracture endpoints were statistically significant when adjusted for multiplicity. The study appears to be underpowered for these fracture endpoints since the actual fracture rate of the study subjects was less than expected.</p></div>

Similar to P1NP, serum concentrations of bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) and osteocalcin peaked at day 14 and declined thereafter, returning to baseline by month 12. Changes in P1NP were assessed through month 24 after the end of double-blind treatment. In both treatment groups, denosumab caused similar reductions in P1NP from months 12 to 24, although the median percent change from baseline in P1NP was significantly lower in the romosozumab/denosumab group than in the placebo/denosumab group at month 13. A rapid initial decrease in serum type 1 collagen C-telopeptide (sCTX) and TRAP5b was observed in subjects randomized to romosozumab (sCTX nadir at day 14, TRAP 5b nadir at 1 month) and levels of both bone resorption markers remained below baseline through month 12. After transition to denosumab, both arms of the study showed the expected decrease in bone resorption markers. The following figures 4 graphs P1NP percent changes from baseline by visit and study group.  The following figure 5 graphs sCTX percent changes from baseline by study visit. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments: Bone turnover markers (BTM) are consistent with dual actions of romosozumab with bone formation and anti-absorption. Action appears to be rapid in onset within the first two weeks of initial drug application, reaching maximal effects by 2 weeks and then tapering off. In both P1NP and sCTX, there is a dose response just after each dose which tapers off by month 9. The BTM patterns support limiting use of romosozumab to one year as BTM levels demonstrate reduced response to romosozumab over time.</head><p>Imaging Substudies In the overall study, romosozumab significantly increased DXA BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck compared with placebo at month 12. When subjects were transitioned to denosumab, BMD continued to increase. Subjects in the Lumbar Spine and Proximal Femur DXA substudy underwent DXA assessments every six months.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments: Imaging substudies support romosozumab's effects by increasing BMD</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Histology:</head><p>A total of 34 subjects were evaluated at month 2, 73 at month 12, and 47 at month 24 (15 of whom underwent sequential biopsy evaluation at months 12 and 24). Quadruple-labeled iliac crest bone biopsies labeled at baseline and after 2 months of treatment, (with 100% labeling compliance) covered a period of potential robust bone formation. These, as well as bone biopsies obtained at month 12, compared the effect of romosozumab with placebo. Biopsies obtained at month 24 provided a cross-sectional comparison of romosozumab for 12 months followed by denosumab for 12 months with placebo followed by denosumab. All but one subject complied with the tetracycline labeling procedure at months 12 and 24. All biopsies evaluable for histology at months 2, 12 and 24 showed normal lamellar bone, normal mineralization, and osteoid. There was no evidence of osteomalacia, marrow fibrosis, or clinically significant marrow abnormality. The month 24 bone biopsy for one subject who received romosozumab followed by denosumab showed woven bone at the top of the iliac crest suggesting microcallus formation, consistent with a nonpathologic process. No other biopsies showed woven bone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Histomorphometry:</head><p>Month 2: Twenty-nine subjects (15 romosozumab, 14 placebo) with quadruple fluorochrome labeling (double fluorochrome labeling at baseline and before month 2) were evaluated for histomorphometry at month 2. Within-subject comparisons between baseline and month 2 showed significant increases in single-label, double-label, and mineralizing surfaces and surfacebased bone formation rates (BFR/BS) in the romosozumab group but not in the placebo group which suggests stimulation of bone formation indices in the cancellous, endocortical and intracortical compartments. Mineral apposition rate did not change significantly in the romosozumab group during that time period and no significant changes in histomorphometry parameters were noted in either romosozumab or placebo group (or between groups) in the periosteal compartment at month 2.</p><p>Median cancellous mineralizing surface percentages were similar at baseline but at month 2 the median percent change in mineralizing surface was 325% in the romosozumab group and 67% in the placebo groups. Similarly, median percent change in BFR/BS at month 2 was approximately 328% in the romosozumab group versus 80% in the placebo group. Consistent with increased osteoblastic activity, increased tetracycline labeling at trabecular, periosteal, and endocortical sites, as well as increased osteoid thickness and volume, and bone formation rates were seen only in subjects in the romosozumab group at month 2. Evidence of decreased osteoclast activity in the romosozumab group was also seen, including lower eroded surface in the cancellous and endocortical compartments and a significantly lower median osteoclast surface in the cancellous compartment. There were no significant differences between treatment groups in cortical thickness or porosity.</p><p>Month 12: Histomorphometry evaluations were performed using bone biopsies from 73 subjects (40 romosozumab, 33 placebo) at month 12. In contrast to the increase in bone formation parameters observed at month 2, dynamic and static formation parameters at month 12 demonstrated a decrease in bone formation. Similar to month 2, eroded surface and osteoclast surface were significantly lower in the romosozumab group than in the placebo group, indicating sustained inhibition of bone resorption.</p><p>Month 24: Histomorphometry evaluations were performed using bone biopsies 47 subjects (24 romosozumab/denosumab, 23 placebo/denosumab) at month 24. After both groups had received 12 months of denosumab, evaluation of histomorphometry parameters did not reveal any significant differences between the romosozumab/denosumab and placebo/denosumab groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MicroCT analyses Month 12:</head><p>MicroCT analysis was performed using bone biopsies from 73 subjects (40 romosozumab, 33 placebo) at month 12. Although there were no significant differences between treatment groups for cortical parameters, significant increases in trabecular BMD and trabecular bone volume, primarily due to increased trabecular thickness were seen at month 12 in the romosozumab compared with placebo group. The thicker trabeculae in the romosozumab group were associated with a significantly lower trabecular bone pattern factor and trabecular bone surface to bone volume compared with the placebo group at month 12. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments: Taken together, there is evidence that romosozumab supports increased trabecular bone formation but may have less or no effect on cortical bone. The histologic and histomorphometric results support significant increased bone formation indices, cancellous bone mineralization, and active osteoblastic activity with decreased osteoclastic activity at month 2 but cortical thickness or porosity did not change by morphometric measurements. The bone is normal by histology. By month 12, the data supports decreased bone formation by histomorphologic parameters and significant increased trabecular bone thickness and volume but no change in cortical parameters by micro CT analysis.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>By month 24 after both groups transition to 12 months of denosumab treatment, there is no difference in histomorphometric parameters. It is unclear if the woven bone found in the one patient treated with romosozumab/ denosumab at month 24 is related to romosozumab exposure as woven bone has not been found with other treatments for osteoporosis.</head></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Durability of Response</head><p>Romosozumab reduced vertebral fracture risk at 12 months and the risk was sustained into month 24 when all patients transitioned to denosumab in this study. BMD increased at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck compared with placebo beginning at month 6, with progressive gains through month 12. These gains were sustained into month 24 after all patients transitioned to denosumab at month 12. Bone formation markers increased and bone resorption markers decreased during the romosozumab treatment period, reflecting the dual effect of the drug with maximal changes during the initial weeks of treatment.</p></div>

The study was conducted at 29 centers in Europe, North America, and Argentina. This study included a 24-month treatment phase, during which subjects received 1 of 5 doses of romosozumab, placebo, or active control (alendronate or teriparatide). This was followed by 1:1 randomization within their original treatment group to receive either denosumab or placebo in a 12-month extension phase, followed by a 12-month retreatment phase with romosozumab, followed by a 24-month follow-on phase with a single dose of zoledronic acid or no intervention. The following <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">figure 8</ref> is a schematic of the study design which includes randomization during the first 24 months with 12 months of denosumab/ placebo randomization phase and 12 months retreatment phase.  At the beginning of the study, subjects will be randomized (1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1) to one of five dosing regimens of AMG 785, placebo, open label ALN or open label TPTD for the first 12 months of the study. The placebo group will be further randomized and evenly distributed across the five dosing regimens defined for the AMG 785 groups. Subjects, sites and study personnel will be blinded to treatment (AMG 785/ placebo) and dose (70 mg/140 mg/210 mg AMG 785), but not to dosing frequency. Upon completion of the first 12 months of the study, subjects in the AMG 785 and placebo groups will continue their assigned treatment for an additional 12 months; subjects in the TPTD group will end study participation, and subjects in the ALN group will be transitioned to receive AMG 785 140 mg SC every month (QM) for an additional 12 months.</p><p>At the end of the 24-month AMG 785 treatment phase, eligible subjects will enter a 12-month denosumab extension phase.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Considerations:</head><p>The sample size is based on the comparison of AMG 785 to the pooled placebo and ALN groups, on the percent change from baseline in BMD at the lumbar spine and hip at month 12. The mean percent change in lumbar spine BMD and standard deviation are assumed to be 0 (3.6) and <ref type="bibr">5 (3.6)</ref> for the placebo and AMG 785 groups respectively. The mean percent change in hip BMD and standard deviation are assumed to be 0 (2.6) and 2 (2.6) for the placebo and AMG 785 groups respectively. Allowing for 15% drop out in the first 12 months, two-sided type I error of groups respectively. Allowing for 15% drop out in the first 12 months, two-sided type I error of 5%, a sample size of 50 per group yields over 90% power on the lumbar spine and hip BMD endpoints using the two sample t-test. The total sample size is 400 subjects. If one of the AMG 785 groups is superior to the other 4 AMG 785 groups by 1 (or 0.5) point on mean percent change in lumbar spine BMD, the probability that the superior group will be numerically largest on mean percent change in lumbar spine is 74% (or 46%). The primary analysis of percent change in lumbar spine BMD will use a linear mixed effects model with 4 contrasts estimating the 4 pairwise differences between the 2 AMG 785 dose schedules (QM, Q3M) and the pooled placebo group and the 2 AMG 785 dose levels (140 mg, 210 mg) and the pooled placebo group, at month 12. The Hochberg procedure will be used to control for multiple comparisons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subject Demographics and Disposition Up to month 24</head><p>In total, 419 subjects were enrolled and randomized: 261 received romosozumab (51 to 54 subjects per dose group), 52 received placebo, 51 received alendronate, and 55 received teriparatide. A total of 383 subjects (91%) completed 12 months of study and 315 subjects (87%) completed the first 24 months.</p><p>Subjects randomized to the teriparatide arm ended the study at month 12 (55 randomized, 46 completed). Subjects randomized to the alendronate arm were transitioned to romosozumab 140 mg QM treatment at month 12. The baseline demographic and key characteristics were comparable across the 8 arms: all subjects were women, mean age was 66.8 years, 86.4% of subjects were white, and the mean baseline lumbar spine and total hip BMD T-scores were -2.29 and -1.53, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Months 24 to 36</head><p>A total of 260 subjects were then randomized in the denosumab extension phase of the study, 129 received denosumab 60 mg Q6M group and 131 received placebo. A total of 248 subjects (95%) completed the extension phase.</p><p>Subject demographics and baseline characteristics were recorded on entering the study and were summarized to assess potential for bias within the subset of subjects rerandomized in the denosumab extension phase. Characteristics were generally well balanced between the denosumab and placebo groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Months 36 to 48</head><p>A total of 167 subjects were enrolled in the romosozumab retreatment phase of the study; of these, 155 subjects (93%) completed this phase. Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally comparable between the total group of 167 subjects in the retreatment phase and the total group of 419 subjects in the 12-month primary analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Months 48-72</head><p>A total of 141 subjects continued into the follow-on phase at month 48, including 51 who were assigned to the no-intervention group and 90 subjects assigned to receive zoledronic acid. Subjects who had previously received the treatment sequence romosozumab/ denosumab/ romosozumab were assigned to receive no intervention and subjects who had previously received any other sequences were assigned to the zoledronic acid group, although 8 subjects who received romosozumab/denosumab/ romosozumab subsequently received zoledronic acid. A total of 50 (98.0%) subjects assigned to no intervention and 88 (97.8%) who received zoledronic acid completed the follow-on phase; 1 (2.0%) subject in the no intervention group and 2 (3.4%) subjects in the zoledronic acid group discontinued the study. Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally comparable between groups, although subjects assigned to no intervention were slightly older (mean age 67.2 years versus 65.8 years for the zoledronic acid group), with a slightly higher percentage of white subjects (84.3% versus 77.8%), and higher mean time since menopause (19.6 years versus 18.1 years). Differences were noted between treatment groups in percentage of subjects in each age group category; however, overall there were similar percentages &lt; 75 years of age in each group (no intervention: 90.2%; zoledronic acid: 92.2%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Results</head><p>Primary endpoint At month 12, the mean percent change in lumbar spine BMD in the romosozumab groups ranged from 5.4% for 70 mg QM to 11.3% for 210 mg QM, compared with-0.1% in the placebo group. Increases for each of the romosozumab groups were significantly greater (p &lt; 0.0001) than for the placebo group after adjusting for multiplicity. In addition, all 4 comparisons included in the confirmatory testing (QM, Q3M, 140 mg, and 210 mg) significantly favored romosozumab over placebo. The following table 19 summarizes the lumbar spine DXA BMD percent changes from baseline at 12 months in the different groups of the study. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary Endpoints</head><p>Increases in BMD from baseline were seen at the lumbar spine at month 3 and month 6, with the greatest increases occurring in the 140 mg QM and 210 mg QM groups. All increases compared with placebo were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>Increases from baseline in BMD at the total hip and femoral neck were seen in some romosozumab dose groups compared with placebo at month 3, and all romosozumab dose groups at months 6 and 12, with the greatest increases occurring in the 140 mg QM and 210 mg QM groups (p &lt; 0.0001). The following table 20 summarizes BMD percent changes from baseline at the total hip and femoral neck at 12 months.  The bone formation markers P1NP, osteocalcin, and BSAP showed dose-related increases with a peak at month 1 in the romosozumab groups versus no increases in the placebo group. The marker levels decreased thereafter with pre-dose levels near baseline levels by 9 months and remaining there with continued dosing. For sCTX, following an initial decrease from baseline (largest at month 1), levels remained below baseline at month 12 in groups that received QM doses of romosozumab (70 mg QM, 140 mg QM, and 210 mg QM).</p></div>

In subjects who transitioned to the zoledronic acid group at month 48, the BMD gains achieved by month 48 were overall maintained by at month 72, (-0.8% change from month 48 BMD). Overall, the mean percent change in BMD at the lumbar spine remained positive from baseline at month 72 (+12.8% for subjects of treatment sequences combined), regardless of initial romosozumab dose received.</p><p>For subjects who transitioned from active treatment to either no intervention or zoledronic acid at month 48, the levels of the bone formation marker P1NP decreased through month 72. Levels of the bone formation markers osteocalcin and BSAP followed similar trends as P1NP. For subjects who had received romo (any dose)/dmab/rom and transitioned to no intervention at month 48, the levels of the bone resorption marker CTX were near baseline at month 48, increased at month 51, then decreased at month 72. For subjects transitioning to zoledronic acid at month 48, CTX declined to below baseline values, reached a nadir at month 51, then increased toward baseline.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Methods:</head><p>The primary analysis to assess the treatment difference for romosozumab treatment groups (romosozumab 90 mg/mL -romosozumab 70 mg/mL) in the percent change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at month 6 employed an analysis of covariance model. The model had main effects for randomized treatment and baseline lumbar spine BMD T-score. The lower bound of the 1-sided 97.5% confidence interval (CI) of the between-treatment group difference was compared with the noninferiority margin of -2.0% for assessing noninferiority. The primary analysis included all randomized subjects who had a baseline and at least 1 post baseline BMD measurement. Subjects were analyzed according to their randomized treatment assignment, regardless of treatment received. To assess the robustness of the primary analysis for the primary endpoint, a sensitivity analysis was performed using the per-protocol analysis subset. Except for the primary noninferiority hypothesis, all inferential statistics were considered exploratory in nature. Continuous variables were summarized descriptively using mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum, maximum, and the number of non-missing observations. Frequencies and percentages were presented for nominal categorical variables.</p><p>The subject incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events and laboratory values over time were summarized by actual treatment received.

All randomized subjects received at least 1 dose of either romosozumab or placebo. Twenty-three (7.8%) subjects discontinued the investigational product during the 6-month treatment period: 6 (11.3%) subjects in the placebo group, 9 (7.6%) subjects in the romosozumab 70 mg/mL group, and 8 (6.5%) subjects in the romosozumab 90 mg/mL group. All subjects were female, 99% were white, and the mean age was 67.7 years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Results</head><p>Primary Endpoint After 6 months of treatment, mean (95% CI) lumbar spine BMD increased 0.8% (-0.4%, 2.1%) in the placebo group, 9.6% (8.8%, 10.4%) in the romosozumab 70 mg/mL group, and 9.2% (8.4%, 10.0%) in the romosozumab 90 mg/mL group. The mean difference between the two romosozumab groups was -1.5% which was within than the prespecified limit of -2.0.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments: This study bridged two different concentration levels for romosozumab by demonstrating that 210 mg SC QM for 6 months administered in the 90 mg/ mL concentration was noninferior to the 70 mg/ mL concentration. Additionally, SAEs were comparable between the placebo and romosozumab groups and AEs were as expected for the population. AE potentially related to hypersensitivity were found more in the romosozumab group but overall AE and SAE rates were balanced between placebo and romosozumab groups.</head><p>Study 20080289 Active-Comparator Controlled-Teriparatide 6.2.4.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments: Study 20080289 was a 12 month study comparing 12 months of treatment with romosozumab to 12 months treatment with teriparatide in PMO patients, previously treated with bisphosphonates. The primary endpoint, total hip BMD, was not sufficient for direct (head-to-head) efficacy comparisons as fracture data is required. Although the BMD data for romosozumab were comparable to studies previously reviewed, this study will not be reviewed in depth because of the insufficient endpoints for comparison.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Integrated Review of Effectiveness</head><p>Assessment of Efficacy Across Trials 7.1. Fracture was assessed as an endpoint in the pivotal Study 20070337. No other supportive studies assessed fractures as endpoints. The coprimary efficacy endpoints were subject incidence of new vertebral fracture through month 12 and month 24. Romosozumab significantly reduced the risk of new vertebral fractures compared with placebo through month 12 (odds ratio = 0.27, p &lt; 0.001), with a relative risk reduction of 73% ([95% CI: 0.16, 0.47]). Vertebral fracture risk reduction persisted over the 24-month study period for subjects initially randomized to romosozumab, as romosozumab for 12 months followed by denosumab for 12 months significantly reduced the risk of new vertebral fractures compared with placebo for 12 months followed by denosumab for 12 months (odds ratio = 0.24, p &lt; 0.001), with a relative risk reduction of 75% (risk ratio = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.16, 0.40]).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary Endpoints</head><p>Sensitivity analyses demonstrated consistent and robust results for the coprimary endpoints. Similar estimates of treatment effect were obtained in sensitivity analyses based on verified stratification variables, the full analysis set, and per protocol analysis set. After controlling for baseline covariates individually and simultaneously in the primary analysis model, romosozumab (month 12) and romosozumab/denosumab (month 24) continued to demonstrate a treatment effect compared with placebo (month 12) and placebo/denosumab (month 24) for the coprimary endpoint at month 12 and month 24.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments: New vertebral fracture results were statistically significant and robust at both the 12 month and 24 month endpoints. Fracture endpoints are important as one of the primary clinical benefit of any osteoporotic drug is to reduce morbidity of fractures in this patient population and romosozumab demonstrates efficacy which is sustained once all patients transition to denosumab.</head><p>Secondary and Other Endpoints 7.1.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary Fracture Endpoint: Clinical Vertebral Fractures</head><p>Clinical fractures was only studied in the pivotal study 20070337 and discussed in Section 6.1. Through month 12, 3 (&lt; 0.1%) subjects in the romosozumab group and 17 (0.5%) subjects in the placebo group had a clinical vertebral fracture. The total number of subjects with a clinical vertebral fracture during the 24-month study period was 4 (0.1%) in the romosozumab/ denosumab group and 24 (0.7%) in the placebo/denosumab group. Romosozumab (month 12) and romosozumab/denosumab (month 24) demonstrated a relative risk reduction in clinical vertebral fractures of 83% (95% CI: 42, 95) compared with placebo through month 12 and of 83% (95% CI: 51, 94) compared with placebo/denosumab through month 24. The nominal pvalues for the treatment comparisons through month 12 and month 24 were 0.001 and &lt; 0.001, respectively but when adjusted for multiplicity, the p-values were 0.008 and 0.096. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>meaningfulness as it is not a standard clinical term as defined in this study, clinical fractures at 24 months did not reach statistical significance when adjusted for multiplicity, and a primary component of clinical fractures, clinical vertebral fractures, is already accounted for in the co-primary efficacy endpoints.</head></div>

Assessments of BMD by QCT were secondary or substudy endpoints in <ref type="bibr">Studies 20070337, 20060326 and 20080289</ref>. Across the clinical program, the data demonstrate that romosozumab treatment leads to an increase in both trabecular and cortical BMD.</p><p>The percent change from baseline in DXA BMD at month 6 and month 18 were evaluated as part of a pre-defined substudy dedicated to evaluating the time course of BMD changes (Lumbar Spine and Proximal Femur DXA Substudy [Imaging substudy II] n = 128; 66 romosozumab and 62 placebo). The data showed that romosozumab resulted in significant and progressive increases from baseline in BMD compared with placebo beginning at month 6 (p &lt; 0.001 at spine, total hip and femoral neck. These BMD data allow comparisons between Study 20070337 and the supportive placebo-controlled studies. The significant increases in BMD at the lumbar spine as well as at the proximal femur imply an impact of romosozumab on bone that is predominantly trabecular, as well as bone that is mixed trabecular and cortical (corroborated by the histology substudy in Study 20070337 and QCT data from Study 20060326 and 20080289.)

Each measurement  was made every 6 months and were statistically significant for BMD gains at the LS, total hip,  and femoral neck with p &lt; 0.001 at each timepoint.</ref> Bone Turnover Markers: Bone turnover markers were discussed in section 6.2 for study 20070337. The BTM data from samples collected prior to a QM dose were similar across the placebo-controlled supportive studies showing a rapid and acute increase in P1NP (median P1NP returning to baseline levels at approximately 9 months) and a rapid decrease in sCTX that remained reduced over the romosozumab dosing period. Across the studies, the maximum P1NP increase was observed at the month 1 time point in all romosozumab groups. The maximum decrease in sCTX occurred at month 1 and sCTX levels remained below placebo at month 12. These results are similar to the pivotal study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewers Comments: Integrated BMD from the pivotal studies and supportive placebo controlled studies demonstrate robust effects of romosozumab on BMD at the LS</head><p>In all studies among bisphosphonate-naïve and bisphosphonate pretreated subjects, BTM levels during romosozumab treatment showed a generally similar pattern, reflecting the dual effect of romosozumab, with an increase in bone formation and a decrease in bone resorption. Across the studies, bone formation markers peaked and returned to baseline by approximately month 6 to 9 while bone resorption markers decreased within a month after the first dose and generally remained below placebo at month 12. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments: BTM demonstrated consistent patterns across all the studies with rapid increase in P1NP and concurrent rapid decrease of sCTX which remained reduced over the romosozumab dosing period, consistent with romosozumab's dual functions of bone formation and anti-absorption which tapers over 12 months. Although the BTM responses are reduced over subsequent doses, there remains a smaller response after each dose and is reflective of continued smaller effects of romosozumab after each dose.</head></div>

This included subjects with baseline lumbar spine or total hip BMD T-scores ≤ -3 where the LS mean treatment differences were 14.6% and 12.6% through months 12 and 24, respectively, for the lumbar spine and 6.8% and 6.4% through months 12 and 24, respectively, for the total hip. In the analyses through month 12, treatment differences across demographic subgroups (ie, age and geographic region) ranged from 12.0% to 14.4% for the lumbar spine and from 4.7% to 6.6% for the total hip and were consistent with the treatment differences observed for the overall population (12.7% for lumbar spine and 5.8% for total hip at month 12. The BMD response among those who received 50,000 IU 25, OH vitamin D during the first week of the study as compared to those who did not was not statistically different.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments: Subgroup analyses for BMD percent change from baseline showed consistent BMD increases at LS and TH among groups when analyzed for age, geographic regions, baseline BMD T-scores including subjects with low BMD (BMD ≤ -3.0).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Study 20070337 Population and Efficacy by Region Baseline Disease by Region</head><p>Overall the baseline characteristics of the patients across the regions were similar. Although only 2.7% of the Study 20070337 population was enrolled from North America, age, and baseline BMD T-scores at the hip and femoral neck were similar between North America and other regions in the study, as were most physical characteristics. The BMI was somewhat lower in Asia Pacific, and a lower height, prevalence of historical nonvertebral fracture and FRAX 10year probability of major osteoporotic and hip fracture was observed for subjects in the Central/Latin America region relative to most other regions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selected Efficacy Endpoints by Region</head><p>New vertebral fracture risk reduction and BMD changes at the spine and the hip were consistent between North America and all other regions evaluated. For fracture endpoints, the small sample number of patients recruited in North America affected the interpretation of the primary endpoint data of the North American population was affected but the overall number of new vertebral fractures was very low, 5 vertebral fractures, (3.5%) in the placebo arm and no vertebral fractures (0.0%) in the romosozumab arm at month 12. The data for BMD percent change from baseline consistently showed statistically significant increases in BMD at the hip and lumbar spine at month 12 compared to placebo, ranging from 12.2 to 14.4 in the lumbar spine, and 4.7 to 6.6 in the total hip. Romosozumab exposure (as assessed by Cmax and Ctrough) was comparable across subjects enrolled in North America and other regions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments: Although North American recruitment was minor, the new vertebral fracture results (0 romosozumab, 5 placebo) support romosozumab effects on vertebral fracture reduction, similar to the rest of the regions. BMD results were robust and consistently increased compared to placebo across all regions of the world such that there does not</head><p>appear to be any regional differences. Romosozumab exposure was comparable and supports no regional differences to exposure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of Subpopulation Analyses</head><p>Subgroup analyses of the co-primary endpoints indicated that the efficacy of romosozumab was consistent regardless of baseline characteristics examined. Likewise, subgroup analyses of percent change in BMD at the lumbar spine and total hip showed romosozumab increased BMD over a range of baseline BMD T-scores and other baseline characteristics. The effects of romosozumab across these subgroups indicate that it can be effective in increasing BMD and preventing vertebral fracture across a broad population of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. When analyzed by region, the percent change in BMD at the lumbar spine and total hip was similar between North America and all other regions, and romosozumab demonstrated statistically significant increases in BMD in all regions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments: Subgroup analyses showed romosozumab had consistent vertebral fracture reduction and statistically increased BMD across regions and there were no differences by baseline characteristics for these results. However, regional differences in Latin/South America affected other fracture endpoints of nonvertebral and clinical fractures as discussed in section 6.2.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dose and Dose-Response 7.1.4.</head><p>Romosozumab 210 mg QM for 12 months (the chosen dose, frequency and duration of treatment) was shown to be efficacious both in subjects who are treatment-naïve and in those who have previously received alendronate, and was not associated with increased adverse events compared with other dosing regimens.</p><p>The proposed dosing recommendation for submission, 210 mg SC QM, is supported by the efficacy and safety data from two supportive studies, Studies 20060326 and 20101291 in combination with PK/PD-based exposure-response analyses. The supportive studies evaluated a range of doses <ref type="bibr">(Study 20060326</ref>  20060326) to allow identification of the most efficacious dosing regimen (dose, interval, and duration) without incurring additional adverse events. These results demonstrate that romosozumab exhibits robust dose-exposure-response relationships and support the 210 mg QM dose regimen tested in the pivotal study.</p><p>Integrated analyses of BMD data for the QM dose groups in Studies 20060326 and 20101291 demonstrated that the 210-mg QM dosing regimen resulted in the greatest increase in BMD (month 12) at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck compared with the other romosozumab dosing regimens tested (70 and 140 mg QM). Furthermore, 210 mg QM and 140 mg QM consistently increased BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck at months 6 and 12 (p &lt; 0.001); whereas, results for the romosozumab 70 mg QM group were less robust, in particular early in treatment when the percent change from baseline in BMD was similar to placebo at month 6 for the total hip and femoral neck. The 210 mg QM dose was also associated with greater increases in BMD at the lumbar spine and total hip than the 2 active controls, alendronate (Study 20060326) and teriparatide <ref type="bibr">(Study 20060326 and Study 20080289)</ref>. The 210 mg SC QM dosing regimen produced the largest and most prolonged increase in markers of bone formation, with median P1NP, BSAP and osteocalcin levels remaining above baseline for 6 to 12 months compared to 3 to 6 months for 140 mg SC QM). In contrast to the bone formation markers which exhibit increases in a dose dependent manner, the reduction in markers of bone resorption appeared to be less dose-dependent. This suggests that compared with 140 mg QM, the 210 mg QM dose of romosozumab has a greater impact on promoting bone formation without a corresponding further reduction of bone resorption. Efficacy, as measured by BMD and BTM, was significantly lower when romosozumab was given in 3-month intervals for both of the Q3M doses tested. For example, at month 12, the 210 mg Q3M BMD efficacy was closer to the BMD efficacy achieved with 70 mg QM dosing in Study 20060326. A dose-ranging study in subjects previously treated with bisphosphonates has not been conducted, however BMD gains at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck appeared to be greater for bisphosphonate-treated subjects who transitioned to romosozumab 210 mg QM in Study 20080289 than for subjects in Study 20060326 who transitioned from alendronate to romosozumab 140 mg QM. Also, the romosozumab 210 mg QM dose does not appear to have a different safety or immunogenicity profile compared with the other regimens tested in the dose-ranging studies.</p><p>The Sponsor's PK/PD modeling and simulations support the choice of the 210-mg QM dosing which demonstrated that a romosozumab dose of 210 mg SC QM provided greater BMD gains at month 12 compared to the other dosing regimens tested. The following <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 11</ref> illustrates the Sponsor's modeling and simulation of dose-BMD response as a function of romosozumab concentration model.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Source: Summary Clinical Pharmacology with reviewer edits. Reviewer Comments: Supportive studies 20060326 and 20101291 demonstrated significant BMD increases and increased BTMs at two romosozumab doses, 140 mg QM and 210 mg QM, while safety and immunogenicity profiles were similar among doses. The Sponsor chose the higher dose, 210 mg QM, for greater increases of BMD and bone formation markers levels which were dose-dependent. Interestingly, bone absorption marker, sCTX was not dosedependent which implies that romosozumab's dual actions of bone formation and anti-bone resorption react independently to dose so that the balance between bone formation and bone resorption is not the same at different doses.</head><p>Onset, Duration, and Durability of Efficacy Effects 7.1.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dosing Duration</head><p>The treatment duration in the initial phase 2 Study 20060326 was 24 months. In this study, the rate and magnitude of BMD increases and the degree of bone formation marker elevation indicated that the greatest efficacy occurred during the first 12 months of treatment. In addition, the levels of bone formation markers collected prior to a QM administration of romosozumab returned to baseline values or fell below baseline values between months 2 and 9 (depending on the dose and the marker) and remained there with continued dosing, whereas the bone resorption marker sCTX remained below the original baseline at month 12. Therefore, the duration of treatment chosen for the subsequent phase 2 and phase 3 studies and for the retreatment phase of Study 20060326 was 12 months.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fracture Risk Reduction with Follow-on Therapy</head><p>The pivotal study 20070337 assessed fracture risk reduction through 24 months (romosozumab or placebo treatment for 12 months followed by denosumab treatment for 12 months). Results demonstrated that fewer fractures occurred during follow-on treatment in subjects who had received romosozumab compared to those who had received placebo in the first year of study (5 versus 25 fractures in the second year, respectively) even though both groups received denosumab during the second year, risk ratio = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.16, 0.40], p&lt;0.001.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BMD with Follow-on Therapy</head><p>In the pivotal study 20070337 follow-on therapy period, the initial romosozumab group (followed by denosumab) continued BMD increases at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck through month 24 when compared to the initial placebo group. Mean differences in percent change from baseline to month 24 in BMD were significantly greater for subjects in the romosozumab/denosumab group compared with the placebo/denosumab group (p &lt; 0.001 at each site), 11.1% at the lumbar spine, 5.3% at the total hip, and 4.9% at the femoral neck. These data demonstrate continued BMD increases in the romosozumab group after transitioning to denosumab. The BMD increases in the romosozumab/denosumab group, after both groups transitioned to denosumab, are of the same order of magnitude as those in the control placebo/denosumab group, maintaining the substantial BMD difference that was achieved during the first 12 months of the study. BMD gains continued in the follow-on therapy groups of the supportive study 20060326 which was consistent with the pivotal study. In this supportive study, two groups of follow-on patients maintained or continued BMD gains at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck after romosozumab therapy, one group with denosumab follow-on therapy (months 24-36) and another group with zoledronic acid follow-on therapy (months 48-72).</p></div>

Subjects randomized to initial therapy with 140 or 210 mg QM doses of romosozumab decreased BMD gains at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck after romosozumab treatment was discontinued, but remained above baseline for the following 12 months during the placebo phase. In these subjects, percent change from baseline BMD (start of study) at the end of this placebo phase were as follows: 4.3 % (140 mg) and 4.8% (210 mg) at the lumbar spine; 1.3 % (140 mg) and 1.1% (210 mg) at the total hip; and 1.3% (140 mg) and 2.3% (210 mg) at the femoral neck, respectively. For the subjects initially randomized to 70 mg QM, 140 mg Q3M, and 210 mg Q3M doses of romosozumab who received placebo during months 24 to 36, BMD at lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck were at or near baseline levels by month 36.</p></div>

For the romo 210/placebo/romo 210 group, the mean percent increase from months 36 to 48 was 12.7% (total increase from baseline 17.6%). For the all romo/dmab/ romo 210 group, the mean percent increase in lumbar spine BMD from months 36 to 48 was 2.9% (total increase from baseline 17.3%). For the romo 210/dmab/romo 210 group, the mean percent increase from months 36 to 48 was 2.8% (total increase from baseline 22.1%).  The same pattern of changes in BMD was seen for total hip and femoral neck during the retreatment period.

The same procedure for drug administration in the healthcare setting by a healthcare provider will be expected for patients prescribed this drug. Healthcare providers will administer the drug to patients in the postmarketing setting which is the same procedure in the clinical studies.</p><p>Efficacy was based largely on a foreign population (&gt; 97%) but subgroup analyses did not demonstrate any regional differences for co-primary efficacy endpoints of reduction of vertebral fractures, gains in BMD or changes in BTMs. It is reasonable to expect that efficacy results will be the same in the US postmarket setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Relevant Benefits 7.2.2.</head><p>Drug dosing schedule will be 210 mg romosozumab SC QM, given by a healthcare provider.

Romosozumab 210 mg QM demonstrated significant increases in BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck, and the effect was seen early with romosozumab treatment (as early as 3 months in Study 20060326). BMD gains were maintained or augmented further in studies that included a transition to antiresorptive therapy after completion of romosozumab. See section 7.1.2 Integrated Secondary Endpoints.</p><p> Romosozumab consistently increased BMD at the lumbar spine and total hip regardless of baseline BMD T-scores, age, and geographic region. When analyzed by region, the percent change in BMD at the lumbar spine and total hip was similar between North America and all other regions, and romosozumab demonstrated statistically significant increases in BMD in all regions. See section 7.1.3 Integrated Subpopulations.</p><p> In subjects who were previously treated with bisphosphonates, BMD gains and strength at the hip as measured by FEA were significantly greater for romosozumab 210 mg QM than for teriparatide at months 6 and 12.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>However, a significant number of subjects were outside the US and these demographic differences may affect the adequacy of the safety database. The disease of postmenopausal osteoporosis has world-wide prevalence but may have different rates based on many variables such as differences in diet, lifestyles, sun exposure, and access to Vitamin D, etc. The main pivotal trial studied only 2.7% US subjects but included 43% Central/ Latin American subjects and 25% Eastern European subjects. The Sponsor did make an attempt to reduce variability between demographic regions by inclusion/ exclusion criteria including minimal baseline BMD ratios at the hip, spine, and pelvis, limited vertebral spinal fracture history, and minimal baseline Vitamin D (Vit D) levels. Baseline Vit D bolus was required in some patients along with daily Vit D and calcium supplementation was required for all patients during the pivotal study in order to decrease variability of Vitamin D access. Together, these measures decreased variability in the different patient demographic populations in the studies.</head></div>

Because inhibition of bone resorption is a component of the dual effect of romosozumab, there is a potential concern for increased risk of AFF. Nonclinical data did not suggest a plausible mechanism for romosozumab to cause AFF. Aged ovariectomized and adolescent cynomolgus monkey data demonstrate the positive effect of romosozumab on cortical bone by enhancing cortical geometry, increasing mass and strength, and maintaining bone quality. The collective data across studies in ovariectomized monkeys support that romosozumab causes transient increases in intracortical remodeling effecting slight transient reductions in cortical BMD only in the radius. The weight of evidence supports that romosozumab's mode of action on cortical bone would be expected to decrease rather than increase the risk of cortical fractures.</p></div>

The early timing for her fracture after only 4 doses raises concerns for rapid onset of romosozumab effects on bone strength and quality as well as the disparity of balance between bone building and anti-absorption properties of romosozumab in the early treatment period. She had no prior exposure to known products linked to AFF such as bisphosphonate or denosumab therapy. This stand-out case remains concerning for romosozumab effects on bone for AFF. Further discussion of other cases continue in the following section.</head><p>Labeling should reflect the concern that romosozumab may be linked to AFF as a warning to practitioners and patients.</p><p>To date in all ongoing and completed studies, there were an additional 5 cases of femur fractures of which 4 cases were adjudicated positive for AFF and was adjudicated as not AFF.

Although the study was blinded at the time of submission for this application, the Division requested unblinded information for the patients in the study who developed AFF. Of the four patients adjudicated for AFF, one subject had been randomized to romosozumab-alendronate roll-over arm and 3 subjects had been randomized to the alendronate-alendronate roll-over arm.

The subject did not have a history of cancer or hip surgery to the affected side. She had no prior use of corticosteroids and no prodromal symptoms over the fracture site. Screening spine X-ray showed a fracture at T5, vitamin D was 17.9 ng/mL, and BMD Tscores were −2.78 at the hip and −2.36 at the femoral neck. Two weeks after initiating romosozumab, the subject underwent unspecified foot surgery. wearing shoes bigger than her size. She sustained a right femur fracture and was admitted to the hospital. She was treated with skeletal traction, analgesics, sedation, and internal fixation of the fracture. A postoperative X-ray showed adequate reduction of the right femur shaft fracture and a new right intertrochanteric femur fracture with a cephalomedullary pin in place. The subject was reported as not having had a fall, injury, or prodromal symptoms that may have led to the right intertrochanteric femur fracture. The event of intertrochanteric femur fracture was adjudicated and did not meet criteria for atypical femur fracture. The investigator assessed the events of femur shaft fracture and intertrochanteric femur fracture as not related to blinded therapy but related to open-label alendronate. The event of femur shaft fracture was reported as resolved with sequelae and the event of femur intertrochanteric fracture was ongoing.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments: Summary of these additional case narratives from unblinded data from the alendronate-controlled trial:  1 case: on Romo-alendronate, AFF at month 33 (after 21 months on alendronate)  1 case: on Romo-alendronate, femur fx NOT adjudicated as AFF at month 28 (after 16 months on alendronate)  3 cases: on alendronate-alendronate arm, AFF after 16, 17, and 28 months on alendronate Of note is that the baseline BMD for all subjects who developed AFF in this study exceeded the exclusion criteria in the pivotal study 20070337 of -3.5 SD BMD at either hip of femoral neck. The exception was the one case of femur fracture not adjudicated as an AFF who had higher baseline BMD (-2.78 SD hip and -2.38 SD femoral neck).</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The presence of AFF or femur fractures in this clinical study does not alleviate concerns that romosozumab is linked to these fractures although these AFF cases are confounded by alendronate treatment as all subjects presented during alendronate treatment which is known to increase risks of AFF but usually after extensive long-term treatment (3 years or more). These subjects were at baseline at high risk for fractures; given their baseline BMD values exceeded -3.50 SD.</head></div>

Within-subject comparisons showed significant stimulation of bone formation in the romosozumab group between baseline and month 2 in the cancellous and endocortical compartments, as demonstrated by significant increases in single-labelled, double-labelled, and mineralizing surfaces and surface-based bone formation rates (BFR/BS) in the romosozumab group. No significant changes were seen in mineral apposition rates (MAR) in the romosozumab group. In the placebo group, no significant changes were noted for any of these histomorphometry parameters in the within-subject comparisons.</p><p>At month 2, romosozumab significantly increased osteoid thickness and osteoid volume compared with placebo. As a consequence of the increased cancellous bone formation rate, the calculated parameter activation frequency (derived from BFR/BS) was also significantly increased. Consistent with the dual effect of romosozumab, a reduction in bone resorption was also evident at month 2, as indicated by significantly lower median eroded surface in the cancellous (romosozumab, 1.810%; placebo, 3.370%) and endocortical compartments (romosozumab, 1.580%; placebo, 6.270%) and a significantly lower median osteoclast surface in the cancellous compartment (romosozumab, 0%; placebo, 0.095%) in the romosozumab group. In contrast to the increase in bone formation parameters observed at month 2, dynamic and static formation parameters at month 12 demonstrated a decrease in bone formation secondary to the decrease in the rate of bone remodeling in the cancellous compartment, consistent with self-regulation of bone formation. The MAR, adjusted apposition rate, singlelabelled, double-labelled, and mineralizing surfaces, surface-and volume-based bone formation rates, activation frequency, and osteoid volume were significantly lower and mineralization lag time and formation period were significantly greater in the romosozumab group compared with the placebo group.

While the bone biopsy results may support this postulate at the end of treatment at month 12, the disparate rate of bone formation compared to bone erosion is most prominent early in treatment at month 2.

Nonclinical data findings suggest that dental disease and inflammation in rats with a lifetime exposure to romosozumab is not associated with ONJ-like findings such as exposed necrotic bone. Sclerostin antibody treatment causes greater alveolar crest height and bone mass in an ovariectomized rat model of localized periodontitis. In fracture repair models, local osteoclastic activity in response to injury is better maintained with sclerostin antibody treatment when contrasted with bisphosphonates and RANKL inhibitors.</p><p>In the 12-month placebo-controlled population (excluding Study 20101291, for which events were not adjudicated), 1 subject in the romosozumab group and no placebo subject had a positively adjudicated case of ONJ. This case was confounded by continuous use of a maladaptive fitting denture. The following <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 33</ref> summarizes ONJ incidence in the placebo controlled portion of the study: One additional positively adjudicated case of ONJ was identified in the romosozumab group of Study 20070337 after the double-blind period (subject was taking denosumab at the time). This case occurred after the administration of 1 dose of denosumab in a subject who had a prior non-serious adverse event of periodontitis. No initial placebo patients developed ONJ in the studies.</p><p>The following are abbreviated summary narratives for these two patients from Study 2007003: A) ONJ during placebo-controlled period Subject : 67-year-old woman (randomized to romosozumab) with osteoporosis and dentures who had a nonserious, unrelated, grade 1 adverse event of tooth fracture on day 109. The subject had no prior bisphosphonate use, no cancer history, no chemotherapy, and no radiation. The fracture of 2 teeth was without significant trauma, and required placement of a new removable partial maxillary denture at month 7, as well as extraction of 4 teeth at month 8. Approximately 13 months after the initial dose of investigational product (day 363), a grade 1, serious adverse event of delay of gum healing was reported as a not-related event The subject had exposed bone of the hard palate at the right maxilla, medial jaw at an extraction site different from the 4 extracted teeth mentioned above. The case was adjudicated positive for ONJ. Follow-up information revealed that the denture was not fitted properly and it was in contact with the exposed bone; however the subject continued to wear dentures during the adverse event of delayed gum healing. The case was readjudicated and remained positive for ONJ. The subject underwent gum cauterization and the event resolved on day 435. B) ONJ during denosumab follow-on period after 12 months romosozumab Subject 65-year-old woman with osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, and dentures, who completed a year of romosozumab 210 mg SC QM and received 1 dose of denosumab 60 mg SC. The subject had no prior bisphosphonate use, no cancer history, no chemotherapy, and no radiation. On day 393, approximately 1 month after the first denosumab dose, the subject had nonserious; grade 2 acute apical periodontitis of the right maxillary canine tooth with subsequent need for multiple root canals and tooth extraction a few weeks later. She then developed delayed healing of the tooth socket and exposed bone which was noted at month 15 for 15 days and then again at approximately month 17. The case was adjudicated positive for ONJ. At month 22, the subject had resolution of the apical periodontitis. The magnetic resonance imaging report of the head and neck showed low intensity area and high intensity area in T1-weighted images and short time inversion recovery, respectively, and was suspicious for osteomyelitis. The subject subsequently developed the serious, grade 2 adverse event of right maxillary jawbone necrosis on day 435. Readjudication following the additional information maintained the positive adjudication classification. As of the cutoff date for this study, the event was ongoing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments: These two cases during the pivotal trial are concerning for a risk of ONJ with romosozumab, one during the placebo controlled portion and one just after a first dose of denosumab. Both cases were adjudicated positively for ONJ. No cases were identified in the placebo group either during the placebo controlled portion of the trial or during denosumab extension.</head><p>Given these findings, there is a concern for ONJ development with romosozumab, especially with maladaptive dentures. This concern should be placed in the labelling as a warning and in the med guide. <ref type="bibr">Reference</ref>  To date in all ongoing and completed studies, there were 2 additional cases of positively adjudicated ONJ. Both additional cases were found in the blinded alendronate-controlled Study 20110142, where the positively-adjudicated ONJ occurred at months 22 and 28 during the open-label phase of alendronate administration. Although the study was blinded at the time of submission for this application, the Division requested unblinded information for the patients in the study who developed ONJ along with information for AFF. The following are abbreviated summary narratives from these two patients, one was randomized to romosozumab and then rolled-over to alendronate while the other one was randomized to alendronate and rolled-over to the same alendronate:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 20110142: Positively Adjudicated ONJ:</head><p>A) Randomized to romosozumab for 12 months and rolled-over to alendronate: Subject 70-year-old female from Norway with a past medical history of cardiac arrhythmia who had no prior treatment with glucocorticoids, immunosuppressants, or IV bisphosphonate, and who was a current smoker (200 pack-years). The subject was reported to have a history of dental abscess, osteomyelitis, root canal in the affected area; and dental treatment 4-6 months prior to the onset of the oral lesion. She completed 1 year of romosozumab and was then rolled over to open-label alendronate. She developed an oral infection in Month 27. In Month 28, the subject had a non-serious adverse event of ONJ, which was adjudicated as positive for ONJ. The subject wore upper dentures, and the area of lesion was at or near the contact point. B) Randomized to alendronate for 12 months and rolled-over to alendronate: Subject 84-year-old Asian female from Hong Kong with a past medical history of osteoporosis, spine fracture, and hypertension. The subject had no prior treatment with denosumab, bisphosphonate, steroids, or immunosuppressants. She completed 1 year of alendronate and was rolled over to open-label alendronate. She developed a non-serious event of osteonecrosis of the jaw in Month 21. The non-serious event of ONJ was adjudicated as negative for ONJ. Despite local debridement and treatment with antibiotics, nasopharyngolaryngosocopy suggested a non-healing wound with granulation tissue, and an imaging study with a CT suggested ONJ. The event was upgraded to serious by the investigator. Due to persistent symptoms leading to hospitalization for treatment of the event, the case was sent for readjudication, and was re-adjudicated as positive. The event of ONJ was reported as ongoing. These two cases were found in the alendronate controlled trial and unblinded at FDA request. Both cases occurred during the alendronate roll-over period but one case of each for a patient randomized to initial romosozumab treatment and placebo treatment. Alendronate treatment confounds the results as the antiabsorptive properties of the bisphosphonates are linked to both ONJ and AFF. The concern that romosozumab increases the risk of ONJ is supported by the fact that one of the patients positive ONJ patients had received romosozumab for one year prior to roll-over to alendronate.</p></div>

Individual adverse event preferred terms were generally reported more frequently in the nonwhite subgroup for both romosozumab and placebo groups. The following table 56 summarizes the sub analysis for AE differences between romosozumab and placebo by race and preferred term in the placebo controlled studies:   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">groups which were balanced. The pivotal study had a great portion (97.5%)</ref> of the study completed outside the US and it is possible practice differences affect the rate of AEs reported in these other countries. Because the numbers are balanced between romosozumab and placebo groups, there is no concern for racial differences with romosozumab in this patient population.</p></div>

A sub analysis was conducted to determine if geographical regional differences affected AEs and romosozumab use. A subgroup analysis of adverse events by geographic region (Western Europe and Australia/ New Zealand, Central and Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific, North America, and Central/Latin America) using the 12-month placebo-controlled population was performed. Subjects in Western Europe and Australia/New Zealand had the highest incidence of adverse events (87.6% romosozumab, 89.0% placebo), followed by North America (84.8%, 81.1%), Asia Pacific (83.9%, 80.2%), Central/Latin America (76.2%, 77.6%), and Central and Eastern Europe (73.9%, 77.6%). Numeric differences were noted across regions in the incidence of certain adverse events. However, no consistent pattern of numeric differences for romosozumab was apparent across regions. Despite regional differences in the incidence of individual adverse events, the incidence of individual adverse events was similar between treatment groups within a region (≤ 5% difference for nearly all adverse events and regions). The following table 58 summarizes AEs by geographic regions overall and using the preferred term in the most commonly reported AEs in the placebo-controlled study populations.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">America which had more subjects had a comparable AE rate between romosozumab and  placebo of 143 patients (9 %) vs 131 patients (9 %)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_38">individual region lessen concerns about regional differences.

Subjects needed to have received at   for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) least 3 years of oral bisphosphonate therapy prior to screening and alendronate in the year immediately prior to screening, with a baseline T-score ≤ −2.5 at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck and history of nonvertebral fracture after the age of 50 or vertebral fracture. This study was designed to evaluate the responses in BMD through 12 months of treatment with romosozumab 210 mg QM, compared with 12 months of treatment with TPTD.</p><p>The percentages of subjects reporting adverse events were generally similar between the TPTD group (148 of 214 subjects [69 %]) and the romosozumab group (164 of 218 subjects [75 %]). The incidences and types of events reported were those that would be expected in the population studied and were generally similar between the TPTD and romosozumab groups. Injection site reactions were observed more frequently with romosozumab (8 %) compared with TPTD (3 %), which led to study drug discontinuation for 1 subject in the romosozumab group. Of the subjects who reported injection site reactions, the median time to the first adverse event was 92.0 days in the romosozumab group and 36.5 days in the TPTD group. The median duration of injection site reaction adverse events was 2.0 days in the romosozumab group and 5.5 days in the TPTD group. The safety findings in this study of subjects transitioning from at least 3 years of oral bisphosphonate therapy and alendronate in the year immediately prior were consistent with the overall safety profile of romosozumab.</p></div>

Subjects who had been receiving alendronate were randomized to continue alendronate treatment or transition to romosozumab; treatment-naive subjects received romosozumab. Adverse events were similar across all 3 groups in this study. Overall, adverse events were reported for 5 of 10 subjects (50%) who received alendronate only; 10 of 24 subjects (42%) who received romosozumab after previous alendronate treatment; and 5 of 6 subjects (83%) who received romosozumab and were previously treatment naive. These differences may be attributed to the small number of subjects in each group. Adverse events were reported as treatment related for 1 subject (4%) who received romosozumab after previous alendronate treatment (injection site reaction) and for 3 subjects (50%) who received romosozumab and were previously treatment naive (injection site erythema, injection site reaction, and nausea); all of these events were reported as mild in severity.

More specifically, romosozumab has been shown to increase markers of bone formation (P1NP, OC, and BSAP) and to decrease the bone resorption marker sCTX compared with placebo. Data from the phase 1 ascending multiple dose study indicated a peak in P1NP around day 15 to 22 with both 2 and 3 mg/kg doses of romosozumab. The phase 2 data confirmed that for all romosozumab doses tested, the bone formation markers increased from baseline at Week 1, achieved peak levels by Month 1 and returned to baseline between Month 2 and Month 9 for P1NP and OC, or by Month 12 for BSAP. For the 210-mg QM dosing regimen, P1NP levels returned to baseline around Month   for initial rollout (NME/original BLA reviews) 6. From Month 6 to Month 12, levels of bone formation decreased below baseline indicating a decrease in bone remodeling. However, it is not known whether bone formation marker levels transiently increase after repeated dosing between Month 2 and Month 12 as P1NP, OC, and BSAP were measured at the end of the dosing interval (ie, before the next monthly injection) in the phase 2 dose-ranging study. From Week 1 to Month 12, sCTX decreased from baseline for all romosozumab doses tested in the phase 2 dose-ranging study, confirming the inhibition of bone resorption observed in the phase 1 studies. Still, the dynamic effects of romosozumab on bone formation and bone resorption are not fully understood. This sub-study will allow further characterization of the effect of romosozumab on bone formation and resorption over time, by assessing the following BTMs:</p><p>• P1NP -a marker of the conversion of procollagen to collagen • BSAP -an indicator of osteoblast activity • OC -an indicator of osteoblast activity • SCTX -a marker of collagen breakdown • TRAP 5b -an indicator of osteoclast numbers Sclerostin levels and iPTH will be assessed as biomarkers to gain additional insights into the effect of romosozumab. Results of iPTH will be analyzed as part of the Serum iPTH and Urinary Calcium sub-study. In addition, blood samples will be collected to support the development of potential novel biomarkers of bone metabolism and PMO.</p><p>The effect of transitioning from romosozumab/placebo treatment to denosumab treatment will be studied by assessing BTMs and biomarkers during the 12-month open-label denosumab follow-up study period.</p><p>In combination with the PK sub-study, the PK/PD relationship will be studied in a broader population.

RATIONALE Romosozumab stimulates bone formation and reduces bone resorption. This unique effect on bone turnover results in marked increase in BMD at the lumbar spine and hip as shown in phase 1 and 2 studies. Yet, the effects of romosozumab on more cortical sites like the radius are not fully elucidated. Preclinical studies with romosozumab at cortical sites in non-human primates showed an increase in periosteal and endosteal bone formation with no increase in cortical porosity <ref type="bibr">(Ominsky et al, 2010)</ref>. A phase 1b study using peripheral QCT indicated a trend to increase Polar Moment of Inertia (PMI), an estimate measure of strength, but did not show major changes in cortical bone area and cortical bone mineral content with 3 mg/kg of romosozumab every 4 weeks over 169 days. Phase 2 data indicated that compared with placebo, there was no statistically significant change in the distal 1/3 radius BMD at Month 12 in any of the romosozumab arms. At Month 12, the percent changes from baseline in distal 1/3 radius BMD in the control arms were -0.9% (placebo), -0.3% (alendronate) and -1.7% (teriparatide); the mean change 210 mg romosozumab QM was -1.2%. DXA BMD measures as well as bone strength are influenced by the bone size and the bone geometric distribution; and neither can be accurately assessed by DXA.</p><p>The proposed DXA and HR-pQCT Imaging sub-study will enhance the understanding of the effects of romosozumab on cortical bone. In addition, the characterization of the effects of romosozumab on bone geometry variables and bone-micro-architecture available from this sub-study will further inform the potential impact of romosozumab on cortical bone strength. For this purpose, in addition to forearm DXA assessments, HR-pQCT (XtremeCT ) scans with an isotropic resolution of 82 m will be performed, allowing longitudinal evaluations of bone structure and micro-architecture parameters <ref type="bibr">(Genant et al, 2008)</ref>. This sub-study will allow the evaluation of the bone density and structural changes in total, cortical and trabecular compartments and relate them to changes in strength estimated by FEA.</p><p>Additionally, to further evaluate the effect of romosozumab as compared with placebo on cortical bone, which comprises 80% of the skeleton, total body BMD with whole body DXA scanning will be assessed.</p><p>The effect of romosozumab treatment for 12 months, followed by denosumab treatment for 12 months will also be studied.</p></div>

Patients with sclerosteosis develop deafness in early childhood in part due to impingement of the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII) caused by hyperostosis <ref type="bibr">(Hamersma et al, 2003)</ref>. Because romosozumab is a bone forming agent, it may theoretically cause clinical hyperostosis in the vestibulocochlear nerve foramina which could affect the nerve and cause changes in audiometry parameters.

Sclerosteosis is an autosomal-recessive disorder caused by an absence or deficiency of the SOST gene which encodes sclerostin <ref type="bibr">(Brunkow et al, 2001)</ref>. SOST is expressed in articular chondrocytes and may be focally increased in cartilage of patients with osteoarthritis (Chan et al, 2011). To date, clinical studies of romosozumab have not detected an imbalance in the incidence or progression of osteoarthritis.</p><p>The purpose of this sub-study is to evaluate the clinical effect of romosozumab on knee osteoarthritis in patients with clinical history of osteoarthritis. The knee has been selected for evaluation as it represents an anatomic location where osteoarthritis results in significant morbidity, and because the WOMAC PRO instrument has been well-validated to assess clinical progression of the disease <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Tubach et al, 2005</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">RATIONALE</head><p>Based on the well-known importance of calcium in mineralizing newly formed bone and the unique mechanism of action of romosozumab to increase bone formation, decreases in serum calcium with expected changes in serum intact parathyroid hormone are expected in subjects treated with romosozumab. Sclerostin, the biologic target of romosozumab, is not known to be a regulator of the well described processes of parathyroid cell proliferation or PTH secretion <ref type="bibr">(Kumar, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Naveh-Many, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Akerström, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kifor, 2002)</ref>.

The increase urinary calcium excretion increases the risk of urinary calcium supersaturation and therefore nephrolithiasis. The mechanism of action of romosozumab is distinct from teriparatide; romosozumab is also a bone anabolic agent, but, since it is not a PTH analog, it does not have the calcemic actions of teriparatide. In the Phase 2 study of romosozumab in post-menopausal osteoporosis women (Protocol 20060326), no significant difference, compared to placebo, was observed in the 24 hour urinary calcium excretion 1 month after initiation of romosozumab.</p><p>Because romosozumab is a bone forming agent associated with compensatory increases in serum iPTH following reductions in serum calcium, this sub-study is designed to measure and better characterize changes in serum iPTH during the 12-month double-blind placebo- controlled study period.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Introduction</head><p>Amgen seeks to market EVENITY (romosozumab), a humanized anti-sclerostin IgG2 antibody, for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk for fracture. AMG785 (romosozumab) inhibits the effects of sclerostin and has both anabolic and anticatabolic effects on bone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Brief Discussion of Nonclinical Findings</head><p>Pharmacology Sclerostin is an extracellular inhibitor of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. It is produced by the osteocyte, a bone mineral-embedded cell derived from the osteoblast, and is involved in paraand autocrine signaling in bone tissue. AMG785, by neutralizing the actions of sclerostin, can transiently stimulate bone formation and inhibit bone resorption, resulting in increases in bone mass and strength. These effects are achieved through time-dependent transcriptional changes in Wnt target genes in cells of the osteoblast lineage (osteocyte, osteoblast, and bone lining cell).</p><p>The bone formation response appears to be self-regulated, possibly due to an osteocyte-mediated inhibition of osteoprogenitor cell proliferation.</p><p>AMG785 blocked the sclerostin-mediated inhibition of matrix mineralization in an in vitro osteoblast cell-based mineralization assay.</p><p>In 12-month bone quality studies in ovariectomized (OVX) rats and monkeys, at doses equivalent to 1-19x and 1-22x human AUC(0-τ) of 12888 µg.h/mL at the monthly subcutaneous dose of 210 mg, respectively, AMG785 increased bone mass and strength of lumbar spine, tibia, femur, and radius in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Bone formation and resorption markers were rapidly and transiently increased. The bone changes consisted of increases in trabecular thickness in vertebrae and long bone metaphyses, and increases in cortical thickness in long bone meta-and diaphyses. These effects were due to stimulation of bone formation concomitant with suppression of bone resorption mostly at trabecular and endosteal bone surfaces. AMG785 caused slight transient increases in cortical bone porosity.</p><p>Increases in bone strength in the OVX animals were demonstrated by positive effects on whole bone and material strength parameters at all skeletal sites evaluated (vertebral bodies and cores, femoral shaft and femoral neck). Humerus bone material strength was not significantly affected. Based on bone mass vs. strength correlations, bone quality was maintained at all evaluated sites. An improvement in bone quality was observed in the vertebrae of rats and monkeys at 19-22x human exposure multiples. Evaluations of selected bone quality parameters did not show any negative effects.</p><p>In human studies, the AMG785-induced increase in bone mass was accompanied by an increase in bone formation and a decrease in bone resorption markers. The increase in resorption markers in animals was probably due to the more pronounced increase in serum PTH causing increased bone turnover at Haversian and possibly periosteal surfaces.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5</head><p>General toxicity Toxicity studies of up to 6-month duration were conducted in rats and monkeys. The main findings were related to the pharmacologic effect of AMG785 and included RBC, WBC and platelet decreases, serum calcium and phosphorus decreases, and extramedullary hematopoiesis. The effects were associated with hyperostosis and increases in bone formation and densitometric parameters. Exposure multiples in the 6-month studies ranged from 1-38x and 1-93x human exposure, in rats and monkeys, respectively. Assessments of local tolerance did not reveal significant concerns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Carcinogenicity</head><p>A carcinogenicity study was conducted in Sprague Dawley rats. The rats were dosed for up to 98 weeks with 0, 3, 10, 50 mg/kg/week, equivalent to 1-19x human exposure. The study did not show any significant increases in tumor incidences. A low incidence of osteosarcoma (2/54) was observed in high dose males at 19x human exposure. However, the lack of statistical significance of this finding and the large exposure multiple suggests that AMG785 is unlikely to increase the human risk of osteosarcoma.</p><p>Osteosarcoma and other bone tumors have previously been observed in rats treated for 2 years with PTH or PTHrP analogues at low human exposure multiples. The absence of bone tumors in the AMG785 study may be related to the self-regulatory nature of the osteoblast bone formation response.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reproductive toxicity</head><p>Reproductive toxicity was evaluated in rat fertility and early embryonic development (FEED), embryofetal development (EFD) and pre-and postnatal development (PPND) studies. Findings in the definitive FEED and EFD studies included reduced ventral processes of the 6 th cervical vertebrae at doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg (17-56x human exposure). However, this anatomical structure is not present in humans and the finding is not considered clinically relevant. Fetal poly-and syndactyly were observed in the definitive EFD study at 32x human exposure, consistent with syndactyly that has been observed in sclerostosis patients and SOST knockout mice. Although it may have been treatment-related, the finding is considered of low clinical relevance based on the exposure multiple, and the timing of digit formation in the first trimester in humans, when placental transfer of immunoglobulins is limited. In the PPND study, there were small decreases in bone mass and size in the F1 offspring at 1.5-56x human exposure of unclear biological significance. None of these findings are considered relevant for the postmenopausal indication.</p><p>Theoretical safety issues Sponsor evaluated multiple potential clinical safety concerns based on the weight of evidence from nonclinical studies, clinical studies and published literature. From a nonclinical perspective there are no indications that AMG75 would increase the risks for osteoarthritis, vascular calcification, increased longitudinal bone growth, hyperostosis, hypercementosis, altered hematopoiesis, sarcopenia, altered glucose metabolism, and exacerbation of TNFα-mediated inflammation. Based on nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology data, the concern about tumor induction or promotion due to activation of Wnt signaling is not considered to be substantial.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nonclinical perspective on clinical bone AEs</head><p>There is some clinical concern about two different skeletal adverse events, atypical femoral fracture (AFF) and osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), one case of which each was observed in the romosozumab treatment group in the pivotal Phase 3 study. The concern was intensified by the identification of romosozumab's antiresorptive properties. However, the nonclinical bone safety evaluations were not suggestive of significant negative effects on bone strength or quality.</p><p>Although the predictive value of the evaluated nonclinical parameters for these events is not entirely clear, this is at least partially reassuring.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies were adequately conducted. The submitted data support the marketing of AMG785 for the postmenopausal osteoporosis indication. The basis of the recommendation to approve is outlined in section 1.3.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Mechanism of Action</head><p>Romosozumab (AMG785) is a humanized IgG2 monoclonal antibody against sclerostin. Sclerostin (Scl) is a cysteine-knot glycoprotein factor produced by osteocytes which plays an important role in the regulation of bone metabolism. Sclerostin was first identified through the discovery of the human genetic high bone mass disorders sclerosteosis and Van Buchem disease (VBD) where sclerostin is absent or subject to decreased expression. The increased bone mass in these populations is thought to be due to the loss of sclerostin's inhibitory effect on bone formation.</p><p>The discovery of sclerostin led to the development of sclerostin antibodies (Scl-Ab) to increase bone mass for therapeutic purposes. The treatment was initially considered anabolic since the antibodies were known to increase bone mass by increasing bone formation. However, it later became evident that sclerostin does not only inhibit bone formation but also activates bone resorption, and Scl-Ab has both anabolic and antiresorptive effects. The Sponsor's nonclinical and clinical studies in this application provide evidence of both actions.</p><p>Sclerostin produced by the osteocyte binds to LRP4, LRP5 and/or LRP6 receptors, which are parts of Wnt receptor complexes, thereby inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling and downstream transcriptional events <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1, below)</ref>. Studies with Scl-Ab in OVX rats have shown complex, time-dependent effects on Wnt target gene expression, mainly in osteocytes but also in osteoblasts and bone lining cells. The targets are directly or indirectly linked to osteoblast and osteoclast generation, differentiation and/or function. The gene transcription changes are most conspicuous in the osteocyte, the cell which is ultimately responsible for the anabolic effect of Scl-Ab. Delayed downregulation of pro-mitotic factors in the osteocyte appears to limit osteoblastic cell proliferation, consistent with the transient or 'self-regulatory' nature of the bone formation response to Scl-Ab. Suppression of bone resorption appears to be at least partly due to blockade of osteocytic RANKL production and stimulation of osteocyte or osteoblast OPG production, while the increase in bone formation involves differentiation of lining cells or osteoprogenitor cells resulting in increased numbers of active osteoblasts.</p><p>It has been suggested that the anabolic effect of intermittent PTH administration occurs at least in part through inhibition of sclerostin which would explain the common anabolic effect of PTH and Scl-Ab treatment. However, PTH can increase bone mass also in the absence of sclerostin, contradicting this hypothesis. The MOA's of these treatments, both probably mediated principally by the osteocyte, have only partly been elucidated.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Primary Pharmacology</head><p>The sponsor conducted in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies with sclerostin-antibodies. The antibodies used in the in vivo studies included rat or mouse Scl-Ab (rat studies) or AMG785 (rat and monkey studies).</p><p>In vitro studies showed high affinity binding of AMG785 to sclerostin, which led to blockade of the sclerostin-mediated inhibition of bone matrix mineralization in a mouse calvarial cell line.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In vivo bone effects</head><p>Long term bone pharmacology studies ('bone quality studies') of up to 12-month duration were conducted with AMG785 in OVX rats and monkeys (Studies 107899 and 107903), at doses up to 50 mg/kg in rats and 30 mg/kg in monkeys (up to 19x and 22x human exposure at the monthly 210 mg dose, based on AUC comparison), respectively. Studies were also conducted in rats and monkeys to evaluate the mechanisms involved in the effects of AMG785 on bone metabolism.</p><p>In both OVX rats and monkeys, AMG785 caused a rapid and dose-related increase in osteoblastic bone formation. Bone marker data also showed increases in osteoclastic bone resorption, which was probably due to PTH-induced stimulation of Haversian and possibly periosteal remodeling. In monkeys, both formation and resorption responses were transient and peaked at 10 weeks.</p><p>The dynamic events led to marked dose-related increases in bone mass and size, evidenced by increases in densitometric and geometric parameters (BMD, BMC, area, perimeter, thickness) , at all evaluated skeletal sites. The increases in bone mass and size were largest in the first 6 months but continued at a slower rate thereafter. Changes occurred at all doses ≥3 mg/kg, with parameters in the mid and/or high dose groups (10-50 mg/kg in rat, 30 mg/kg in monkey) exceeding those in the sham control groups.</p><p>Histomorphometry of cancellous and cortical bone sites showed enhanced bone formation predominantly at trabecular and endocortical surfaces, and increases in trabecular and cortical thickness. Cortical thickening in both species was mostly due to increased endosteal bone apposition, although there was also a periosteal component. In OVX monkeys, the bone formation increases were most pronounced after 3 months of dosing and declined to control levels at 12 months. Bone resorption indices (eroded surface fractions) at these surfaces were reduced in the AMG785-treated OVX monkeys, particularly at 3 months in rib but were still observed at 12 months in femur. The resorption effect was not significant in the OVX rat. In OVX monkeys, increased bone modeling was evidenced by a reduction in quiescent surface and an increase in formative surface fraction due to activation of bone lining cells.</p><p>In cortical bone, AMG785 also increased periosteal and intracortical ("Haversian") bone formation rates in rats and/or monkeys. Based on lack of significant changes in bone width and porosity in monkeys, resorption at these two surfaces was probably also increased. This was most likely due to the AMG785-induced increase in serum PTH.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>21</head><p>Bone strength was increased in conjunction with bone mass, and there were positive effects on extrinsic as well as intrinsic (geometry-corrected) biomechanical parameters at both cancellous and cortical bone sites. Based on the positive and statistically significant correlations between bone mass and whole bone strength parameters, and between bone density and intrinsic strength parameters, adverse effects on bone quality were not identified in the 12-month studies. In both monkeys and rats, an apparent improvement of vertebral bone quality was seen at the high doses of 30 and 50 mg/kg, respectively.</p><p>Data from a high dose recovery group in the 12-month OVX monkey study with treatment discontinued after 6 months showed that all or most effects of AMG785 reversed towards OVX control levels, including BMD/BMC, trabecular and cortical thickness, and strength parameters.</p><p>One exception was the reduction in endocortical eroded perimeter fraction in femur shaft, which was still significantly decreased vs OVX control at end of recovery.</p><p>In another 6-month study in OVX monkeys (Study 118025) at a clinically equivalent dose of 3 mg/kg dose, a detailed evaluation of changes in radius and tibia was performed. AMG785 caused an increase in intracortical bone turnover mainly in radius but also in tibia. Slight decreases in diaphyseal pQCT-vBMD were also observed in radius in tibia, as seen in the 12-month OVX monkey study. However, DXA-BMD of all radius regions was increased. Histomorphometry showed slight increases in cortical porosity which may have contributed to the decreases in pQCT-vBMD. However, BMC and cortical thickness of both radius and tibia were slightly increased and there were no decreases in diaphyseal and metaphyseal strength of the radius at 3 and/or 6 months.</p><p>Tissue BMD (bone without soft tissue) was minimally but significantly decreased by AMG785 in vertebrae, radius and tibia (cortical and/or cancellous bone) of OVX monkeys. The significance of the tissue BMD effect was not clear.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Kinetics of remodeling</head><p>While AMG785 induces modeling-based bone formation and suppresses bone resorption, residual resorption followed by formation continues to contribute to the bone remodeling process. A reconstruction of the kinetics of the vertebral remodeling cycle was performed using histomorphometry in a 28-week study in aged male monkeys (Study R20150071). Vertebral bone volume and formation were increased, and an increase in MS/OS reflected improved osteoblast efficiency. The kinetic analysis showed decreased resorption and reversal periods, a decrease in erosion depth, an increase in wall thickness and no significant effect on formation period. This resulted in a positive bone balance in the individual bone remodeling units. A reduction of resorption and reversal periods was also observed in iliac cancellous bone after 3 months of treatment in the 12-month study (107903) and explains the decrease in eroded bone surface fractions (ES/BS) in both the 28-week and the 12-month study.</p></div>

AMG785 showed positive</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BLA #761062</head><p>Reviewer: Gemma Kuijpers, Ph.D.</p><p>22 effect on bone healing in this study. MBF was increased and RBF was unaffected at vertebral trabecular and femoral endocortical surfaces. The exploratory analyses showed a very slight shift in vertebral BMDD towards lower values, and a decrease in vertebral BMDD standard deviation suggesting an increase in the homogeneity of trabecular bone with respect to mineral density. There were no global mineralization effects. Matrix and mineral properties were not affected in any bone compartment, but intracortical mineralization appeared temporarily accelerated. Evaluation of MBF and RBF suggested that increases in both modeling and remodeling based bone formation likely contribute to the bone efficacy of AMG785. The data were generally supportive of preservation of bone quality upon AMG785 treatment and did not suggest significant bone safety concerns.</p><p>Mechanistic studies Mechanistic studies provided information about gene transcription in vertebral osteocyte, osteoblast and lining cells in response to acute and chronic Scl-Ab dosing (Studies 105877 and 115777). After initial stimulation of osteoblast number and activity, there was a delayed induction of p53 and an inhibition of mitogenesis and cell cycle progression signaling pathways in the mature osteocyte. This was likely limiting the proliferation of cells in the osteoblast lineage (steoprogenitors) and related to the 'self-regulation' (transient increase) of bone formation. Transcriptional activation of genes involved in osteoclastogenesis and resorption were less clearly self-regulated. The MOA of Scl-Ab appears to include stimulation of osteoblast OPG production, and inhibition of osteocyte RANKL production, together causing a suppression of osteoclast generation and/or function. The sponsor suggested that in contrast to Scl inhibition, activation of bone formation by PTH is not tightly self-regulated, which may explain the pronounced bone tumorigenicity of PTH(rP) analogues (Study 115776).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Species differences</head><p>In general, the effects of AMG785-induced sclerostin inhibition on bone turnover, mass, structure, and strength were similar in OVX rats, OVX monkeys and postmenopausal women, suggesting broad cross-species similarity in the role of sclerostin in bone metabolism. The main difference between animals and humans was the decrease in resorption markers in postmenopausal women vs. the increase in resorption markers in animals. This was probably related to the larger increases in serum PTH observed in animals who did not receive dietary Ca supplementation, causing more stimulation of intracortical and possible also of periosteal bone remodeling. Nonetheless, histologic bone resorption indices at trabecular and endocortical surfaces were reduced in OVX monkeys (Study 107903), an effect that was also observed in humans, and in rats treated with rat Scl-Ab, r13c7 (Study R20110286). The apparent lack of such an effect in the AMG785-treated OVX rats may have been due to the fact that resorption indices were measured only after 12 months of dosing in the pivotal OVX rat study.</p></div>

Effect on formation and resorption markers peaked at 3 months, but were 2.5-fold larger for formation marker P1NP vs resorption marker CTx. o AMG785 caused increases in PTH and Vitamin D that remained above OVX levels at 12 months. Serum Ca was slightly decreased. o Densitometry (DXA) showed increases in BMD and/or BMC and Area in spine, tibia, femur, and distal radius. Increases were most prominent in the first 6 months, and at 12 months levels often exceeded those in sham controls at both 3 and 30 mg/kg. o PQCT showed increases in cortical thickness in tibia and radius diaphysis due to slight increase in bone width and/or decrease in medullary area. Cortical BMD was transiently decreased in tibia (minimally) and radius (slightly), but BMC was slightly increased. o AMG785 increased bone strength of femur diaphysis and did not affect intrinsic cortical bone strength. Bone strength parameters in spine and femur neck were increased consistent with densitometry results. o Correlations between bone mass and strength were positive and suggested maintenance or improvement of bone quality. o Histomorphometry was performed for ilium, vertebrae and femoral neck (cancellous bone), and for rib and femur diaphysis (cortical bone), at interim time points and/or end of study.  Data clearly showed progressive increases in trabecular and cortical thickness over time, and increases in bone formation indices including BFR/BS at trabecular, endocortical, periosteal and Haversian (intracortical) bone surfaces, particularly at the earlier biopsy time points (Wk 13), consistent with the transient nature of the increases in bone formation markers.  Cortical thickness increases in rib and femur were mainly due to endosteal bone apposition consistent with pQCT densitometry.  Numerically, BFR/BS in OVX controls was largest at Haversian &gt; endocortical ≈ trabecular &gt;&gt; periosteal surfaces.  The increase in trabecular and endocortical bone formation was due to an increase in formative vs quiescent fractional bone surface (i.e. bone modeling). Wall thickness was increased in cancellous bone.  The slight increase in cortical porosity at 6-12 months suggested a concomitant increase in Haversian resorption. Similarly, the lack of change in total bone area suggested a concomitant increase in periosteal resorption.  In cancellous bone, eroded surface % was decreased only at Wk 13 in ilium.</p><p>Endocortical eroded surface % was markedly reduced in rib, mostly in Wk 13, to below OVX and sham control levels. However, it was also markedly suppressed in femur diaphysis at 12 months, and was not reversed in the recovery group. Data suggested that at the endocortical surface AMG785 initially causes a marked stimulation of bone formation ("modeling") and a marked and continued reduction in osteoclastic bone resorption. o The increases in systemic resorption markers (reflecting all skeletal surfaces) were probably due to increases in Haversian resorption and to a minor extent to periosteal resorption, outweighing reductions in resorption localized to trabecular and endocortical surfaces. This enhanced resorption was probably related to the AMG785-induced PTH increase, protecting against hypocalcemia.</p></div>

Final W.Th was also projected for packets near completion at the end of the study to reflect the treatment effect after 28 weeks. o Resorption depth was measured in packets at the reversal line without osteoid with preosteoblasts, by counting lamellae from the deepest point outward along the surface until a quiescent surface was reached.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments/ Conclusions</head><p> Neutralization of Scl in OVX rats by rat-specific Scl-Ab r13c7 (weekly dosing) caused increases in trabecular, endocortical and periosteal bone FORMATION, more prominently in Wk 6 than in Wks 12 and 26.  Scl-Ab r13c7 also caused marked sustained suppression of trabecular and endocortical bone resorption (this is unlike effect of AMG785 which did not clearly affect resorption markers or histologic indices in OVX rat).  This dual effect led to increases in bone mass and strength at various skeletal sites. Bone quality (correlation BMC vs strength) was maintained. This effect was more similar to the effect of AMG785 in postmenopausal women than that of AMG785 in the OVX rat.  After dose discontinuation, treatment with RANKL inhibitor (OPG) or less frequent treatment with r13c7 preserved the gains in bone mass and strength. This correlates with the proposed clinical use of romosozumab for 12 months, followed by a change to treatment with denosumab (Prolia; a RANKL inhibitor).  <ref type="bibr">(Taylor et al, Bone 84: 148-159, 2016)</ref> o 8-month old OVX rats were treated with rat Scl-Ab r13c7 (0, 50 mg/kg), once weekly for 26 weeks, followed by an 18-wk recovery period. o Methodologies included histomorphomtery, pQCT, stereologic analysis, LCM (laser capture microdissection) to separate bone cells, RNA extraction, microarray, and Taqman, and gene network/function analysis.</p></div>

However, the most significant signaling changes occurred in pathways that would limit cell cycle progression <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 5B, below)</ref>. o The temporal relationship between these transcriptional changes and changes in BFR/BS suggests that suppression of mitogenesis and cell cycle progression may contribute to the self-regulation of bone formation observed with long-term Scl-Ab treatment. o The induction of p53 and other tumor suppressor signaling would be expected to limit mitogenesis and reduce the potential for bone carcinogenicity. o RANKL/OPG ratio was suppressed during the 26-week dosing phase, consistent with the effects on bone resorption parameters. o Trabecular bone mass progressively increased through Day 183, and declined during recovery. Oc.S/BS (% osteoclast covered surface) was decreased during the dosing and increased in the recovery period, with corresponding changes in expression of major regulators of osteoclastogenesis. Changes of genes important for osteoclastogenesis regulation mirrored the histologic changes in bone resorption. o The potential MOA of acute and chronic Scl-Ab exposure is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_38">Fig.9</ref> below.</p></div>

Animals were injected SC Q2W with vehicle or r13c7 at 25 mg/kg for 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 9 weeks (n = 8/grp for Wks 1-2; n = 26/grp for Wks 3-9). Treatment was initiated 1 day post fracture. Endpoints included histomorphometry, densitometry (DXA, pQCT and micro-CT) and bone strength testing over the time of healing through 9 Wks post fracture.</p><p>Scl-Ab r13c7 increased bone mass in the fractured femur by Wk 3, with increases in torsional strength by Wks 5 and 9. Tx with r13c7 induced increases in bone volume and decreases in marrow volume in the external callus.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>The Sponsor presented an extensive discussion of theoretical/potential safety issues of romosozumab, based on gene and/or protein expression of sclerostin in various tissues <ref type="table" target="#tab_87">(Table 1</ref>, below), and the potential activation of Wnt signaling by AMG785.</p><p>The issues were considered in the context of published literature as well as Sponsor's own clinical and nonclinical studies, and included: cancer, osteoarthritis, vascular calcification, increased longitudinal bone growth, hyperostosis, hypercementosis, osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), altered hematopoiesis, sarcopenia, altered glucose metabolism, exacerbation of TNFαdriven inflammatory disease, and atypical femoral fractures (AFF).</p><p>Since sclerostin is mainly produced by osteocytes, chondrocytes, cementocytes, blood vessels and vascular muscle cells, and para-and autocrine effects are probably most important, issues in mineralized and adjoining tissues (eg bone marrow), teeth, joints, and the vasculature seem most plausible. Carcinogenicity due to enhanced Wnt signaling in Scl target cells is also a potentially relevant issue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cancer</head><p>Carcinogenicity was considered a potential concern based on the presumed role of the Wnt signaling pathway in tumor development. Factors considered in the Sponsor's discussion included the temporal effects of sclerostin inhibition on bone cell signaling pathways and the self-regulation of bone formation, the pathophysiology of sclerosteosis and Van Buchem disease, findings in SOST-/-(Scl-deficient) mice, data from long term animal studies with AMG785,</p></div>

Possible effects on tumor progression were also considered.</p><p>The Sponsor concluded that the weight of evidence supports that romosozumab would not pose a carcinogenic risk to the intended patient population. Reviewer essentially agrees with this conclusion and its underlying rationale. The absence of WBC or lymphocyte increases in the rat and monkey toxicity studies, and the lack of leukemia in the animal toxicology and human studies, in particular of acute myeloid lymphoma (AML), a cancer observed in mice with specific osteoblast B-catenin activation, alleviates the concern about hematopoietic cell tumorigenicity.</p><p>Although the finding of two osteosarcomas in the high dose male group in the rat carcinogenicity study lacked statistical significance, this Reviewer does not exclude the biological relevance of this finding. The tumor incidence was marginally outside the historical control range and the tumors occurred in the group with the largest bone mass increases. However, whether or not this was a chance finding, the low incidence combined with the 20-fold exposure multiple in the affected group renders its clinical relevance unlikely. Inclusion in the product label is not considered necessary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Osteoarthritis</head><p>Based on the hypothetical role of disrupted Wnt sigaling in osteoarthritis (OA) and the expression of Scl in chondrocytes, there is a theoretical concern about induction or exacerbation of OA. Published literature data, however, are conflicting with regard to the potential for beneficial or adverse effects of sclerostin in OA. Data from Sponsor's nonclinical studies in the rat meniscus tear model (OA model) did not show adverse effects, and data from long term toxicity and bone pharmacology studies did not show degenerative changes in joint cartilage. Sponsor concluded that the available nonclinical and clinical data support the safety of the proposed clinical treatment regimen.</p><p>Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) In the pivotal Phase 3 Study 20070337 (12 month placebo or AMG785, followed by 12 months of denosumab), one case of ONJ was seen in the 12-month romosozumab treatment period and one other case was observed in the romosozumab-group after one dose of denosumab given at 12 months. Two cases of ONJ were observed in ongoing Clinical Study 20110142 in Months 22 and 28 during open-label ALN treatment (at least 10 months after AMG785 dosing).</p><p>The pathophysiology of ONJ (necrotic exposed bone in maxillofacial region) is not well understood. There appears to be a strong association with suppressed bone resorption/turnover and use of relatively high doses of antiresorptives (e.g. IV bisphosphonates, and RANKL-Ab denosumab). The event also appears to be linked to underlying infection or inflammation and is often preceded by dental surgical procedures. Accumulation of unrepaired microcracks has been put forward as one of the relevant underlying mechanisms <ref type="bibr">(Kim et al, Clin Oral Invest, 20: 2251</ref><ref type="bibr">-2258</ref>.</p><p>Based on the established association with anti-resorptive treatment, the ONJ cases in Study 20070337 may be related to the suppression of alveolar bone resorption by AMG785.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>46</head><p>comparison, in the 2-year rat study alveolar inflammation associated with molar attrition (tooth wear) was not associated with bone necrosis. Sponsor argued that in other animal studies with Scl-Ab (intact, OVX, periodontitis, osteotomy or other models) bone resorption was still partially preserved also in the context of local injury, and fracture callus remodeling was not impaired. This is unlike the results from studies with BPs or RANKL-inhibitor denosumab, in which osteoclastogenesis and callus remodeling can be suppressed or delayed. Sponsor also used clinical bone marker and histomorphometry data, which showed suppression of cancellous bone resorption in both AMG785 and denosumab treated, to conclude that the resorption suppression by romosozumab is less generalized than by denosumab and that it is unlikely that AMG785 would pose a meaningful risk for an increased risk of ONJ in the patient population. In this Reviewer's opinion it is uncertain whether or not this conclusion is justified. This is partly because it is not clear whether the animal data that were used to support the lack of risk have adequate predictive value for pharmacologically induced ONJ in humans. Besides, the clinical histomorphometry data showed more suppression of cancellous bone formation in the romosozumab than the denosumab group. An additional study in an adequate rodent model that has shown bisphosphonate-mediated induction of ONJ, may be useful to provide more relevant information.</p><p>Atypical femoral fractures (AFF) In the pivotal Phase 3 Study 20070337, in the first 12-month study period, there was one case of AFF following 3.5 months of romosozumab treatment, in a patient with apparent prodromal pain in the fracture area before study start. Four cases of AFF have also occurred in Study 20110142, an ongoing trial including romosozumab and alendronate (ALN) treatment periods, but only after 16-28 months of ALN exposure, with or without previous AMG785 exposure. There were no cases in Study 20060326, a multi-dose Phase 2 study, including placebo, romosozumab (various doses of 70-210 mg QM or Q3M, up to 24 months), alendronate and teriparatide arms, and denosumab extension and romosozumab (210 mg QM) retreatment phases.</p><p>The pathogenesis of AFF is unclear, but is thought to be related to sustained suppression of bone resorption. Prolonged treatment with anti-resorptives (eg bisphosphonates) increases the risk of AFF, and the background incidence of 1 in 100,000 patient-years in the normal population can increase to 50 per 100,000 patient-years in bisphosphonate-treated patients. The suppression of bone resorption may be associated with osteocyte aging and death which could adversely affect a number of microscopic bone tissue processes/properties, e.g. microcrack repair, tissue homogeneity, matrix collagen properties (e.g. due to accumulation of advanced glycation end products, AGEs) and extent of mineralization or crystallinity <ref type="bibr">(Geissner et al, J Biomech, 48: 883-894, 2015)</ref>. These factors are all considered important for preservation of bone quality and strength. Long term disruption of any of these processes may lead to reduced toughness of bone material, making it more brittle and susceptible to stress fractures (i.e., fracture due to repetitive loading). Animal studies in intact dogs have shown that bisphosphonates can reduce cortical rib bone toughness/material strength after relatively long treatment periods (Burr et al, <ref type="bibr">Bone 71: 58-62, 2015)</ref>, and this may be related to the occurrence of human AFF. However, an unequivocally predictive marker or mechanical parameter for AFF risk has not been established.</p><p>The Sponsor carried out an in-depth evaluation of the weight of evidence for a potential increased risk of AFF. It was concluded that the nonclinical data did not provide any evidence of</p></div>

This Reviewer basically agrees with this assertion, based on the aggregate data from intact and OVX animal studies, several of which included bone mass and biomechanical measurements. There was one femoral/acetabular fracture each in the mid (10 mg/kg) and high dose (100 mg/kg) groups in the 6-month rat and monkey toxicity studies, respectively. However, both cases were not associated with clinical signs and the conclusion that the fractures were probably pre-existing is supported by the lack of a bone safety signal in the other long term nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies conducted at equivalent doses.</p><p>Intact mice may be an underused model to test effects on bone quality/strength. In mice treated for relatively short periods with alendronate (8 wks), whole bone strength of the femur was enhanced but this was accompanied by an increase in brittleness or decrease in predicted material strength (Uveges et al, JBMR 24 <ref type="formula" target="#formula_34">(5)</ref>: <ref type="bibr">849-859, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Misof et al, Bone 36: 150-158, 2005)</ref>. By contrast, Scl-Ab decreased femoral bone brittleness in mice <ref type="bibr">(Sinder et al, Bone 71: 115-123, 2015)</ref>. A study in a pharmacologically responsive mouse model with AMG785 and a bisphosphonate control may provide additional information on cortical bone mechanical properties.</p><p>AFF and ONJ are unexpected events with AMG785 treatment, because the product was at least initially considered an anabolic agent. Their small incidence and relatively early occurrence (3-10 months) in the Phase 3 study could support an argument that they are not treatment-related; on the other hand the incidence appears larger than the background incidence, which causes some concern that a specific type or location of Scl-Ab induced resorption suppression, possibly in combination with the enhanced formation effects, may cause unanticipated bone safety issues not signaled by the reassuring nonclinical bone quality data. Additional nonclinical evidence may be obtained from studies to: (1) address the issue of ONJ in an adequate surgical rat model, and (2) assess bone quality in AMG785-or m13c7-treated mice, to help guide future regulatory decisions.</p><p>Other theoretical safety issues Based on nonclinical and clinical safety data, other issues including or regarding vascular calcification, longitudinal bone growth, dental effects, hematopoiesis, sarcopenia, glucose metabolism and inflammatory disease do not appear to be a significant concern. Hyperostosis is the desired effect of the product and at the selected clinical dose of 210 mg QM it does not appear to lead to bone overgrowth with adverse consequences. The animal hematology changes (eg RBC, Hct decreases) at high doses were most likely secondary to the marked bone increases, and have been observed with other products that increase bone mass. The submitted nonclinical information also suggests that issues in other organs in which sclerostin is expressed, such as kidney, heart and lung, are unlikely. Reviewer agrees with Sponsor that the proposed clinical treatment regimen (210 mg romosozumab, QM, for 12 months) is unlikely to pose a significant increase risk related to these theoretical concerns in the intended patient population.</p></div>

In some studies, rodent versions of the humanized antibody AMG785 (rat 13c7 (r13c7) and mouse 13c7 (m13c7)) were used because AMG785 causes anti-drug antibody (ADA) formation in those species. PK of AMG785 was evaluated after SC and IV dosing in rats and monkeys. AMG785 has a high and similar affinity to sclerostin across species, and shares more than 90% sequence homology. Single dose PK was evaluated in rats for all three antibodies (humanized AMG785, r13c7 and m13c7), while only AMG785 was evaluated in monkeys. Multiple dose AMG785 TK was evaluated in rats and monkeys. The PK of two formulations of AMG785, made for first in human (FIH) and commercial administration, respectively, was compared in monkeys.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>49</head><p>A single dose of AMG785 given by SC injection yields a Tmax of 24h-48h in rats (1-35 mg/kg), and Tmax of 24h-93h in monkeys (3-30 mg/kg). SC bioavailability in rats ranged from 50-100% in the 1-35 mg/kg dose range. SC bioavailability in monkeys was approximately 100% at 100 mg/kg. Plasma T 1/2 in rats increased and clearance decreased with increasing IV doses, ranging from 6h to 28h at 0.1-10 mg/kg. Terminal T1/2 of an SC dose in monkeys was 36h-88h in the 3-10 mg/kg dose range.</p><p>AMG785 exhibits non-linear PK in rats and monkeys, with greater than dose-proportional increase in exposure at doses &lt;10 mg/kg, and linear PK with dose-proportional exposure increases at ≥ 10 mg/kg. Upon weekly dosing in rats and monkeys (3-300 mg/kg), Tmax was 24h-96h and terminal T1/2 upon recovery was 60h-94h (rat) or 74h-116h (monkey). Accumulation was less than 2-fold with weekly dosing. There were no PK sex differences.</p><p>There were no tissue distribution studies. AMG785 was transported across the placental barrier. Volume of distribution (Vss) was 37-59 mL/kg and similar to plasma volume (30 mL/kg). No conventional metabolism studies were conducted since AMG785 is an antibody subject to catabolic peptide and amino acid degradation. Clearance may also involve typical IgG removal by the reticuloendothelial system. No specific excretion studies were conducted. Nonclinical PK interaction studies were also not conducted, since DDI risk is very small.</p><p>TK data were available from all pivotal repeat dose toxicity studies. Anti-drug antibody (ADA) formation was observed in rats and monkeys resulting in lower exposure and reduced PD response. Hence, ADA positive animals were excluded from TK analysis in studies of 6 months or longer duration. This was not an issue in single dose studies since ADA development generally requires 3 to 4 wks of dosing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assays</head><p>Assays to detected AMG785 antibodies (ADAs) were ECL-based homogenous bridging immunoassays based on the bivalent characteristics of the antibody binding. The testing strategy consists of a screening assay and a specificity assay. The screening assay is performed to detect the presence of binding antibodies. Samples with a signal-to-noise (S/N) value greater than the cut point are then tested to confirm response specificity. Samples that deplete in the presence of excess soluble drug are reported as positive for the presence of anti-romosozumab antibodies. Also, an ECL-based competitive target binding assay was developed to detect the presence of antibodies that are capable of disrupting the binding of romosozumab to sclerostin in serum samples. This assay also follows a tiered two-assay approach consisting of a screening assay and a confirmatory assay.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exposure Multiples</head><p>Human PK AMG785 was generally well tolerated and there was no treatment-related mortality in any of the rat studies.</p><p>The 14-day study with weekly doses of 30, 100, 300 mg/kg SC, or 300 mg/kg IV in the rat (Study 105909) showed increased bone formation, hyperostosis and increased spleen hematopoiesis. The NOAEL was 300 mg/kg, with AUC(0-168h) exposures of 254 and 608 mg.h/mL, for SC and IV dosing, respectively.</p><p>The 6-week study with weekly doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg SC in the rat (Study 121854) was conducted to evaluate effects in the skull. Results included increased bone formation as well. Subperiosteal bone was a mixture of woven and lamellar bone, similar but not identical to embryonic intramembranous bone.</p><p>The pivotal studies of 1-and 6-month treatment duration in rats with recovery (Studies 105908 and 107245) mainly showed effects related to the pharmacodynamic activity of AMG785, including dose-related increases in bone formation markers and increases in cancellous and cortical bone mass and thickness as evaluated by densitometry (DXA/pQCT) and histopathology. Resorption markers were not clearly affected, although some increases were observed in recovery periods. A summary of the data follows, but further details can be found in the tabular summary below.</p><p>Anti-AMG785 antibodies were detected in both 1-and 6-month studies, leading to reduced AMG785 exposure. In the 6-month study, ADA positive animals were excluded from PK analysis. AUC was generally dose-proportional and study findings were generally doserelated. AUC was similar in males and females. TK data showed slight but inconsistent accumulation between Day 1 and Week 26.</p><p>The pharmacologic effect on bone led to secondary changes in hematology and the hematopoietic system. The hematologic effects, e.g. RBC decrease and other blood cell changes (eg in platelet count or volume) were most likely an indirect effect of increased bone formation and narrowing of the hematopoietic bone marrow space, although a partially direct effect of AMG785 on marrow hematopoietic cells cannot be entirely excluded. Some non-RBC blood cell changes in female rats (e.g. WBC, lymphocyte decreases) were also observed at 100 mg/kg in the 6-month study. There were no effects on differential WBC counts.</p><p>Serum phosphorus was increased in 100-300 mg/kg males in the 1-and 6-month studies, with unclear cause. Significance of (transient) glucose increases in both studies was unclear.</p><p>Histologic effects included hyperostosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, injection site findings (males and females), and a few muscle (necrosis), teeth (odontoma) and kidney histopathology findings in single males.</p><p>Hyperostosis consisted of increases in trabecular number and thickness (hyperostosis), firm marrow, and decreases in cortical bone marrow space due to endosteal bone apposition. The bone effects were seen at all doses in all rat studies. The increase in spleen and/or liver extramedullary hematopoiesis was an adaptive response to the anemia secondary to the pharmacologic bone effect. Injection site irritation was observed after 6 months of dosing with 100 mg/kg.</p><p>Minimal skeletal muscle necrosis, seen in 1-and 6-month studies in 1 high dose male each was of unclear relation to treatment. Biological significance of mandibular odontoma (mixed tumor of dental tissue origin) in one high dose male rat in the 6-month study was unlikely to be treatment-related. No dental cell/tissue tumors were seen in the 2-year carcinogenicity study with group sizes of N=60/s/g at doses up to 50 mg/kg. A femoral neck fracture was observed in 1 mid-dose male (10 mg/kg) at Wk 26 (by X-ray) and was still perceptible at Week 40 (end of treatment-free phase). The fracture was chronic and resulted in a non-union and pseudoarthrosis at the left coxo-femoral joint (hip joint). Fibrosis with embedded bone debris and intact femoral head was noted in the acetabulum section and correlated with the thickening noted macroscopically. Sponsor considered the finding incidental and suggested it may have occurred before study initiation as there were no signs of lameness noted during the study and the microscopic changes showed "chronic fracture with pseudoarthrosis". Bone fractures are unusual in rats and the cause of the fracture is uncertain. Considering the lack of clinical signs, the fracture was likely incidental and present before study start. However, the similar location of another femur fracture in a high dose (100 mg/kg) female monkey in the 6-month monkey study renders the finding noteworthy. <ref type="bibr">(1-month and 6-month</ref>  Bone densitometry: DXA: Increase in femur and lumbar spine BMD and BMC, dd (M,F); pQCT: Increase in proximal tibia (metaphyseal (total, trabecular, and cortical) bone area, BMD and BMC.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RAT STUDY COMMENTS:</head><p> The 104-week rat study via sc injection was conducted to assess the carcinogenic potential of AMG785. The study was terminated at Week 91 for male groups and</p><p>Week 98 for female groups. The survival at the end of study was between 25-40% and comparable across all groups. Non-neoplastic changes associated with the pharmacological effect of AMG785 included effects in bones (hyperostosis), spleen and liver (secondary extramedullary hematopoiesis), and injection sites (mononuclear cells infiltrate).</p><p> The Sponsor identified two statistically significant neoplastic findings: renal lipoma in females (N = 1, 0, 0, 3 in ctrl, LD, MD, HD; p =0.0486 by trend test; incidence in HD females slightly outside the historical control range of 0-2), and adrenal cortical adenoma in 10 mg/kg males (N = 0, 2, 6, 2 in ctrl, LD, MD, HD; p = 0.0169 by pairwise comparison, within historical control range of 0/120-6/60). Since renal lipoma in females is generally considered a rare tumor, this would be considered a statistically significant trend since the p-value (0.0486) was ≤ 0.05. However, due to low incidence and lack of pre-neoplastic precursor lesions, the increased incidence of renal lipoma in HD females was not considered to be of toxicological significance.</p><p>Since adrenal cortical adenoma in males is generally considered a common tumor and a p-value of 0.0169 (&gt; 0.01) does not indicate statistical significance, and since there was a lack of dose response (N=0, 2, 6, 2 across groups), the increased incidence in the 10 mg/kg MD males was not considered of toxicological significance. Sponsor concluded there were no significant neoplastic changes associated with AMG785 administration.</p><p> FDA tumor analysis: Statistical review of the tumor data showed that there was an increase in incidence of adrenal cortical adenoma in 10 mg/kg males, that was statistically significant if considered a rare tumor (pairwise test FDA p=0.0184 &lt; 0.05); and an increase in incidence of pancreatic islet cell adenoma in females (N=0, 0, 3, 3) that was statistically significant if considered a rare tumor (trend test p = 0.0323 &lt; 0.05). However, adrenal cortical adenoma in males was considered a common tumor based on average historical control incidence of ca. 2% (20/1057). Therefore the increase in MD males was not considered statistically significant. The islet cell adenoma incidence in MD and HD females (3/60, 3/60) was within the historical</p></div>

The increase in renal lipoma in 50 mg/kg females (p = 0.0429, trend test) was concluded to be not statistically significant based on the concurrent control of 1/60 (i.e. common tumor) and the p-value being &gt;0.01. In conclusion, FDA review did not identify any statistically significant increases in tumor incidences in male or female rats given AMG785 for up to 98 weeks at doses of 3, 10, 50 mg/kg/wk <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(equivalent to 0.6, 4x, 19x</ref> the human AUC at the proposed monthly dose of 210 mg).</p><p> There were two osteosarcomas noted in the males dosed with 50 mg/kg/week. The finding was not statistically significant by trend test or pairwise comparison. One of the tumors was detected at gross necropsy as a macroscopic lesion/mass in the brain and also by radiographic skull/frontal bone production (Animal #4069, Day 587, fatal osteosarcoma, skull). The other tumor was detected in the tibia by focal radiographic bone loss followed by tibia histopathology in an animal with death caused by pituitary adenoma (Animal #4041, Day 572, incidental osteosarcoma, tibia). The incidence in the high dose male group was 3.7% (2/54), marginally exceeding the historical control range of 0-3.3%. Sponsor noted that the use of radiography in the current study was responsible for detecting one of the two tumors. Based on this study design feature, late onset and solitary occurrence of bone tumors, and lack of pre-neoplastic findings or other types of bone tumors, the Sponsor considered the osteosarcomas in the high dose males to be spontaneous occurrences. Although not statistically significant, the two osteosarcomas in the high dose male group, in which bone mass increase was largest, may have been treatment-related based on mechanism of action of AMG785, i.e., activation of the (pre)osteoblast. However, the 21-fold human exposure multiple suggests that the clinical significance of the tumor finding, even if treatment-related, is unlikely.</p><p> Macroscopically, there were AMG785-related non-neoplastic findings in bones (miscellaneous, calvarium femur, lumbar vertebrae L5-L6, sternum and tibia) and spleen. AMG785 also caused dose-dependent bone thickening in males and females, correlating with increases in bone mineral content (BMC) by ex vivo peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) and hyperostosis microscopically. This effect was usually observed in all bones collected per protocol. An increased incidence of spleen enlargement was noted in females at  3 mg/kg and in males at 10 mg/kg, correlating with increased extramedullary hematopoiesis microscopically.</p><p> Microscopically, there were non-neoplastic changes associated with AMG785.

Changes in bones, spleen, and liver were dose-dependent, whereas changes in injection sites were not dose dependent.</p><p> There were no satellite TK groups included in this study. Blood samples were collected in Week 13 for TK and ADA analysis. Animals positive for binding and neutralizing antibodies were then removed from the study. The retained number of animals was N=60/grp for all male and female groups, except it was N=54/grp for high dose males. In retained animals, anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) were still present in 18 males at 3 mg/kg, 3 males at 10 mg/kg, and 10 males at 50 mg/kg, and in 1 female at 50 mg/kg. The mean AMG785 serum concentration(s) in ADA positive animals were lower than in ADA negative animals among those retained by approx. 0.8x, 0.8x and 0.5x for the LD, MD, HD males, and 0.3x for the HD female.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer comment on rat study findings:</head><p>In rat carcinogenicity studies with daily SC dosing with PTH or PTHrP analogues, marked dose-dependent increases in osteosarcoma, osteoblastoma, osteoma, and/or osteoblast hyperplasia have been observed, also at relatively low human exposure multiples. The concomitant bone mass increases in the animals with bone tumors were similar to or smaller than those observed in the current AMG785 study. This underscores an important difference between sclerostin antibody and PTH products with regard to nonclinical bone tumorigenicity.</p><p>Key Study Findings (From Dr. Tsai-Turton's review)  AMG785 was given to Sprague Dawley rats at 0 (vehicle), 3, 10, 50 mg/kg/week (60/sex/group) weekly via sc injection for a minimum of 91 weeks in males and 98 weeks in females. Blood samples were collected on Week 13 for TK analysis.  There were no AMG785 treated effects on clinical observation, body weight, or food consumption.  There was no AMG785 treatment effect on survival. Prior to the end of treatment period (Week 91 males and Week 98 females), there were between 36-43 rats/sex/group that had died or were euthanized. AMG785 had no effects on the overall survival rate or mortality.  There were increased bone radiopacity in almost all males and females treated with AMG785 that correlated with thickening of the bone (macroscopically) and hyperostosis (microscopically). This was an expected pharmacological effect of AMG785.  Marked dose-related increases in bone mass and geometry were noted at the femur metaphysis and diaphysis. Trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) was 4-fold and 6-fold higher in males and females, respectively, when compared to vehicle controls.  AMG785 did not cause a statistically significant increase in neoplastic findings.  AMG785 did cause non-neoplastic findings. However, findings were limited to pharmacological effect of AMG785, including hyperostosis, secondary extramedullary hematopoiesis in spleen/liver, and mononuclear cell infiltrate at the injection sites.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>Reproductive studies were conducted in rats, since the product is strongly immunogenic in rabbits. In both the combined fertility/embryo-fetal development (FEED) study and the definitive embryo-fetal development (EFD) study in rats, romosozumab at doses of 100 and/or 300 mg/kg (17x-56x) the proposed monthly 210 mg clinical dose, based on AUC exposure) caused a slight increase in the incidence of reduced ventral processes on the 6 th cervical vertebra, a skeletal variation, in the absence of other developmental delays or maternal toxicity. This finding is sometimes considered a developmental delay in a skeletal process that is not present in this cervical vertebra in humans. Since other delays in vertebral development/ossification were not observed, and the variation is not considered toxicologically relevant or relevant for humans, the finding may not need to be included in the product label.</p><p>External skeletal malformations, including fore-or hindpaw syndactyly (fused digits) and polydactyly (extra digits), occurred in 7/16 fetuses of 1 litter at the high dose of 300 mg/kg in the definitive embryo-fetal development study, at approximately 32x human AUC based on TK data from dose range finding EFD study. The skeletal malformations exceeded historical control values. Other skeletal malformations and variations were also observed in 3 of the 7 affected fetuses in this litter. While these anomalies were not observed in any litters in the combined F/EFD or the PPND study, it is recommended that the findings be included in the label, because incidence exceeded historical control range, and the findings are likely treatment-related based on the known role of sclerostin in the skeleton and the presence of this type of skeletal developmental abnormality in humans and mice with genetic sclerostin deficiency.</p><p>In a pre-and post-natal study in rats, romosozumab caused transient decreases in food intake during the first two weeks of dosing at 60 and 300 mg/kg and increases in incidence of sparse hair coat at 300 mg/kg in the F0 generation females. In the F1 generation, there were slight but statistically significant decreases in bone mass in male and female pups at 60 and 300 mg/kg, and changes in cortical geometry in male pups at doses ≥10 mg/kg. The doses of 10, 60 and 300 mg/kg are equivalent to 1.5x, 19x and 56x the proposed clinical 210 mg dose, based on GD13 AUC data from the FEED study. No skeletal abnormalities in the C6 cervical vertebrae were observed in the F1 generation pups at any dose.</p><p>Reproductive toxicity study data are included in the label, conforming to regulations, including the findings in animal EFD and PPND studies. The sought indication is the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. . Key Study Findings  Male and female Sprague Dawley rats were given once weekly SC doses of AMG 785 before cohabitation, through mating and through the period of organogenesis, at dose levels of 0, 10, 60, 300 mg/kg (N=25/s/g main study; 4/s/g TK). Dams were euthanized and fetuses examined on GD21.  There were no effects on mortality, clinical signs, body weight, food consumption or necropsy observations.  No effects on mating, fertility, male reproductive parameters (sperm analyses or organ weights), ovarian or uterine parameters, embryo-fetal survival or fetal body weights were observed.  At 300 mg/kg, there were 3 fetuses from 3 litters that had reduced ventral processes (which develop into the rat carotid tubercles) on the 6th cervical vertebrae, slightly exceeding the historical range of the test facility, which was considered to represent a developmental delay (development of the ventral processes of the cervical vertebrae proceed in an anterior to posterior direction and the ventral processes on the 7th cervical vertebrae had not started to develop at gestation day 21). No other fetal morphology changes were observed at any dose level. Key Study Findings  A dose range finding study was conducted in pregnant SD rats given two SC doses of 0, 30, 100, 300 mg/kg, on Gestation Days (GD) 6 and 13 (N=8/s/g main study, N=8/s/g for TK). C-sections and maternal/fetal observations were performed on GD21. Exposure was determined on Days 6 (AUC 0-168h ) and GD13 (AUC 0-144h ).  AMG 785 was well-tolerated. No treatment related effects were observed on maternal or fetal parameters at any dose tested.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>80</head><p> There were no dose-dependent differences in litter or fetal incidences of any gross external, soft tissue or skeletal alterations.  Fetal ossification site averages were generally comparable among the four dose groups. Key study findings:  AMG 785 was administered to pregnant SD rats at doses of 0, 30, 100, 300 mg/kg, twice, subcutaneously, on Gestation Days 6 and 13 (N=25 F/grp). Dams were euthanized on GD21 and fetuses were examined.  Toxicokinetics (serum concentrations only) and antibody assessment of each dam were determined on GD 21 after euthanization.  No treatment related effects were observed on maternal parameters at any dose tested.  At 0, 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg, the litter incidence of malformations or variations was 5 (21.7%), 5 (26.3%), 10 (41.7%) and 9 (40.9%), respectively.  Seven fetuses from one litter in the 300 mg/kg dose group had extra digits (polydactyly) on the fore-and/or hindpaws and six of these fetuses also had fused digits (syndactyly).  One to 3 fetuses from the same litter at 300 mg/kg also had incompletely ossified phalanges, misaligned metacarpals, large ulnae, misaligned metatarsals and large tibias, irregularly shaped metacarpals, broad ribs, and irregularly shaped ilia.  Irregular shaping of the arch in the 6th cervical vertebra was also observed in 4 to 5 fetuses from 4 litters in the 100 and 300 mg/kg group. The incidence of litters and fetuses with irregular shaped 6 th vertebrae at 100 (litters 17%; fetuses 2%) and 300 mg/kg (litters 18%; fetuses 3%) was greater than the historical control range (litters 0-12.5%; fetuses 0-1.7%) for the testing facility and should be considered AMG 785 related.  There was a dose responsive increase in anti-AMG 785 binding antibodies with 4% of the controls expressing antibodies and 25%, 20%, and 64% of the 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg groups expressing antibodies on GD 21.  NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 300 mg/kg (56x the proposed 210 mg clinical dose, AUC comparison).  NOAEL for fetal toxicity was 30 mg/kg (4.9x the proposed 210 mg clinical dose, AUC comparison) based on fore-and hindlimb skeletal malformations at 300 mg/kg, and the cervical vertebral ossification delay at 100 and 300 mg/kg. Key Study Findings  AMG 785 was administered at SC doses of 0, 10, 60, and 300 mg/kg, weekly, to female Sprague Dawley rats beginning 6 weeks before cohabitation, and continuing weekly through the gestation and lactation periods.  F0 generation:</p></div>

It inhibits the action of sclerostin, a negative regulator of bone formation. The consequence is an increase in bone formation, a decrease in bone resorption, and an increase in bone mass and/or size. In clinical trials with once monthly doses of 210 mg SC, this led to a statistically significant reduction in incidence of new vertebral fractures (-73%) and non-statistically significant reductions in nonvertebral (-25%) and hip fractures (-46%). BMD increases were observed in spine, total hip and femur neck, but small decreases in BMD were detected in distal radius. Bone formation markers were increased and resorption markers decreased.</p><p>The applicant completed an adequate nonclinical development program that consisted of in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies, mechanistic studies, PK/ADME studies, and toxicology studies. The latter included general toxicity studies in rats and monkeys, local tolerance studies in rats and monkeys, a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, and rat reproductive toxicity studies. Most studies were conducted using the SC dosing route. Dosing frequency in the animal studies was usually once weekly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanism of Action</head><p>Sclerostin-antibodies bind the osteocyte glycoprotein product sclerostin with high affinity, preventing its interaction with LRP4, LRP5 and LRP6 co-receptors of the Wnt receptor complex. This activates para-and autocrine canonical Wnt signaling in cells of the osteoblast lineage (osteocytes, osteoblasts and lining cells). The transcriptional changes that ensue lead to a rapid increase in bone formation and a decrease in bone resorption. The process involves time-dependent alterations in the expression of a multitude of Wnt targets, extracellular matrix genes and bone cell activity modulators. Upon chronic dosing, the osteoblast bone formation response appears to be subject to negative feedback or self-regulation. The effects of Scl-Ab are highly bone tissue-specific due to predominant expression of Scl protein in the osteocyte.</p><p>Primary Pharmacology AMG785 binds with similar affinity to sclerostin from human, monkey and rat (Kd = 11, 23, and 3 pM, respectively). In vitro assays showed that AMG785 was able to prevent the sclerostin-mediated inhibition of bone mineralization.</p><p>Long term bone pharmacology ("bone quality") studies were conducted in OVX rat and monkey models of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Treatment with AMG785 was started after 2-month (rat) or 4-month (monkey) bone depletion periods.

The monkey study included a 6-month posttreatment recovery group.</p><p>The main effects in these studies consisted of dose-related increases in bone formation and cancellous and cortical bone mass (BMD/BMC) at all skeletal sites evaluated (spine, femur, tibia, radius), correlating with increases in bone strength. Bone mass increased most rapidly in the first months of treatment and continued to increase progressively albeit at a slower rate through 12 months. DXA-BMD increases were most pronounced in spine, proximal tibia, proximal femur and femoral neck, and least pronounced at distal femur and distal radius (all regions). While cortical BMD (pQCT) was minimally decreased in the first 6 months in distal radius diaphysis, cortical BMC and thickness were not affected or slightly increased. Densitometry, structural and mechanical parameters in the higher dose groups were usually increased to levels exceeding those in sham controls. Most bone effects diminisheded in the 6month recovery group in the monkey study. The effects observed in the animals were generally consistent with the BMD effects observed in clinical studies with a romosozumab dose of 210 mg QM. Based on monkey and human data, a 12-month clinical treatment period appears to be adequate, since the BMD increases occurred mainly in the first months and strength changes are likely to parallel these effects.</p><p>Bone formation markers peaked in both species during the first 3 months of treatment, returning towards control levels at 12 months. Resorption markers, however, were increased in both rats and monkeys with maximal effects at 3 (monkey) or 6-9 months (rat). The latter was probably due to enhanced bone resorption/remodeling at intracortical and possibly other bone surfaces caused by the treatment-related increase in serum PTH, outweighing the decreases in resorption at trabecular and endocortical surfaces at a systemic level. By contrast, data from clinical studies showing that increases in formation markers were accompanied by decreases in resorption markers. Serum PTH was also increased in romosozumab treated clinical study subjects but this effect was less pronounced than in animals probably due to adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation in the clinical studies.</p><p>Histomorphometry of cancellous and cortical bone parameters was performed at 3, 6, and 12 months in OVX monkeys, and at 12 months in rats. Treatment-related increases in cancellous bone volume were due to increases in trabecular thickness, and increases in cortical bone thickness were due to enhanced endosteal and/or periosteal bone apposition. Dynamic bone formation indices were increased at all surfaces (trabecular, endosteal, periosteal and intracortical/Haversian), particularly at earlier time points. Bone formation rates, largest at trabecular, endosteal and intracortical surfaces in control animals, were all increased by AMG785, but periosteal bone formation was usually increased to the largest extent.</p><p>In both rats and monkeys, the increases in periosteal and endosteal bone formation rates were probably accompanied by increases in resorption (not measured) based on comparatively small changes in bone thickness. This also pertained to Haversian surfaces where increased formation rates resulted merely in non-significant or transient increases in cortical porosity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>85</head><p>Resorption as indicated by eroded surface fraction was decreased in cancellous and cortical bone of monkey ilium and rib, respectively, and in monkey femoral cortex and rat tibia at end of study, although the effect in rat was very small. There were no significant effects on Mlt and O.Th. An increase in wall thickness in vertebral bone was the result of decreases in both resorption and reversal periods and a slight increase in formation period.</p><p>Biomechanical testing demonstrated increases in compressive, bending and shear strength parameters in vertebrae, femur shaft and femur neck, respectively. In monkeys, material strength of humerus cortical beams was not affected. Bone quality is comprised of bone material and structural properties. Statistically significant correlations between bone mass and strength parameters indicated that bone quality, when defined as slope of mass vs. strength regression lines, was maintained upon AMG785 treatment at all bone sites evaluated. Bone quality was slightly improved at the 30 mg/kg dose in rat and monkey vertebrae, probably due to improvements in architectural, not material properties. The data did not raise any concerns about potential adverse effects on extrinsic (whole bone) or intrinsic (material) bone strength.</p><p>A 6-month OVX monkey study with a dose of 3 mg/kg, equivalent to clinical exposure, was performed to further evaluate the transient decreases in cortical vBMD in radius and tibia observed in the 12-month OVX monkey study. The study showed that AMG785 caused slight decreases in pQCT-derived volumetric BMD (radius and tibia), while DXA-BMD of all radius regions was increased. The pQCT vBMD decreases were associated with increased intracortical bone turnover and cortical porosity, which was most prominent in radius but also observed in tibia. However, pQCT-BMC and cortical thickness of both radius and tibia were increased and there were no decreases in dia-and metaphyseal bone strength of the radius.</p><p>In a 10-week study in adolescent male monkeys with a Q2W dose of 30 mg/kg there were no adverse effects on bone tissue characteristics, evidenced by bSEM and FTIRM analyses. Global mineralization was not affected by AMG785, BMDD was minimally affected in trabecular bone, and matrix/mineral properties, crystallinity and collagen cross linking were not affected in any bone compartment. The small changes in some of the measured parameters were unlikely to have negative effects on bone tissue quality.</p><p>A detailed analysis of vertebral remodeling kinetics in a 28-week study in male monkeys at 30 mg/kg Q2W showed that AMG785 caused decreases in resorption depth and resorption period as well as an enhanced resorption rate. Combined with a (transient) increase in formation period this resulted in increased wall thickness and a positive bone balance in individual bone remodeling units. Data from the 12-month OVX monkey study and the 10-week study in male monkeys showed that AMG785-mediated increases in bone formation were initially modeling-based, resulting from a rapid activation of bone lining cells. The modeling-based formation attenuated with time, and remodeling-based formation continued steadily increasing bone mass as described above. The study results generally showed skeletal site-and surfacespecific effects of AMG785 in rats and monkeys.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>86</head><p>Several other studies were conducted in OVX rats with a rat surrogate Scl-Ab, r13c7, to avoid an immunogenic response. The results again showed increases in vertebral and femoral BMD, improved trabecular bone structure, and increases in vertebral and femoral strength. Suppression of resorption markers and histologic resorption indices in the r13c7-treated rat resembled the anti-resorptive effect of AMG785 in humans, in contrast to the increases in resorption parameters in the AMG785-treated OVX rats. Additional animal studies showed positive effects of AMG785 on bone mass and strength in models of other bone loss models, and positive effects on bone healing without untoward effects on bone remodeling in macroscopic fracture repair models.</p><p>Mechanistic studies confirmed the self-regulation of the osteoblastic bone formation response with initial increases in osteoblast numbers due to activation of lining cells, followed by reductions in osteoprogenitor number, upregulation of osteocyte transcription factors involved in inhibition of cell cycle progression, and upregulation of extracellular Wnt inhibitors (e.g. SOST).</p><p>In conclusion, the bone study data showed positive effects on bone mass and strength and did not reveal any obvious signals of impairments in bone quality or bone mechanical properties. The effects of AMG785 resembled those of increased mechanical loading. This is not surprising in light of the recognized role of sclerostin in the bone response to loading.</p><p>Safety pharmacology AMG785 had no adverse effects on neurobehavioral effects in the rat at single doses up to 300 mg/kg (IV). Single IV doses up to 300 mg/kg had no effects on cardiovascular parameters and respiratory rate in monkeys. Also in monkeys, there were no ECG or blood pressure changes in 1-month and 6-month repeat dose studies at doses up to 300 mg/kg (SC or IV) or 100 mg/kg (SC), respectively.</p><p>PK/ADME AMG785 exhibits non-linear PK in rats and monkeys, with greater than dose-proportional increases in exposure at doses &lt;10 mg/kg, and linear PK with dose-proportional exposure increases at ≥ 10 mg/kg. This is consistent with target mediated drug disposition for IgGs. In rats, SC bioavailability in rats was 100% at 1 mg/kg, and 50% at 35 mg/kg, and in monkeys it was approximately 100% at 100 mg/kg. Plasma T 1/2 in rats increased and clearance decreased with increasing IV doses, ranging from 6h to 28h at 0.1-10 mg/kg. Terminal T1/2 of an SC dose in monkeys was 36h-88h in the 3-10 mg/kg dose range.</p><p>Upon weekly dosing in rats and monkeys (3-300 mg/kg), Tmax was 24h-96h, and terminal T1/2 upon recovery was 60h-94h (rat) or 74h-116h (monkey). Accumulation was less than 2-fold with weekly dosing. There were no sex differences in TK in repeat dose studies. Elimination occurs by catabolic peptide and amino acid degradation, or IgG removal by the reticuloendothelial system. In the embryofetal development studies, AMG785 was detected in fetal rat serum (35-90% of maternal serum concentrations), indicating transplacental transfer.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>87</head><p>Two different drug substance formulations were manufactured and used during development. The Process 1 drug substance formulation (70 mg/mL AMG785) was used in Phase 1-2 clinical studies, in early nonclinical studies, and in 6-month rat and monkey toxicity studies. The commercial Process 2 drug substance formulation was used in Phase 1-3 clinical studies, and in rat reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity studies. An SC singledose monkey PK bridging study provided support that AMG 785 Process 1 and Process 2 drug products are similar from a nonclinical perspective.</p><p>Anti-drug antibody (ADA) formation was observed in rats and monkeys resulting in lower exposure and reduced PD response, particularly when ADAs were neutralizing. Hence, neutralizing ADA-and/or binding ADA-positive animals were either removed from longer term studies, or removed from data analysis including PK evaluations. AMG785 was highly immunogenic in rabbits and this species was not used for toxicity assessments.</p><p>A tissue cross-reactivity immunohistochemistry study showed binding of AMG785 to osteocytes in human, cynomolgus monkey, and rabbit, but not rat bone. Binding was also observed in aorta or pulmonary artery in a monkey. The cause of the lack of rat osteocyte staining is unclear. It is unlikely to be related to the lack of resorption suppression in the AMG785, but not the r13c7 treated rat, since the rat did have a clear and most likely osteocyte-mediated anabolic response to AMG785.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Toxicity</head><p>Repeat dose studies of 14-day, 1-month and 6-month duration were conducted in rats and monkeys. Pharmacological bone responses were seen at all study doses in both species, evidenced by increases in bone formation markers, bone mass and bone volume, changes in resorption markers and histomorphometric formation indices, bone thickening, hyperostosis and firm marrow. In both species, bone effects were present at the lowest doses equivalent to expected human exposure. Based on pharmacologic responsiveness, rats and monkeys were adequate test species.</p><p>Other findings included decreases in RBC in rats and monkeys, and decreases in platelet counts, reticulocyte count or % and WBC (all cell types), and increased compensatory spleen and/or liver extramedullary hematopoiesis in rats. These changes were most likely secondary to the bone effects. Serum calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) were decreased in monkeys, possibly due to enhanced bone mineral formation. A direct effect of AMG785 on blood forming elements in the marrow, in particular myeloid cell proliferation, was a concern based on the finding of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in mice with constitutively activated osteoblast Wnt/β-catenin activation <ref type="bibr">(Kode et al, Nature 506(7687): 240-244, 2014)</ref>. However, this concern was allayed by the lack of significant changes in WBC cell or differential counts and the likely transient nature of the enhanced β-catenin signaling in the osteoblast upon treatment with Scl-Ab.</p><p>Reference ID: 4081796 (b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(4)</ref> Incidental findings in a few animals in high-dose rat and monkey study groups at large human exposure multiples were of uncertain or unlikely toxicological significance. Serum glucose and phosphorus increases in rats may have been treatment-related but were of unclear significance. Compared to the 1-month studies, the 6-month studies did not show significant additional toxicities. Recovery group findings demonstrated partial reversibility of the bone findings and reversibility of the hematology and serum Ca and P changes.</p><p>In aged OVX monkeys treated for up to 12 months with doses of 3 and/or 30 mg/kg/wk, equivalent to 1 and 22 times human exposure at 210 mg QM, radiography did not show exacerbation of arthritis or spondylosis and did not result in aortic calcification. Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood lymphocytes did not indicate changes in absolute or relative numbers of various types of B-cells.</p></div>

While there was a concern about osteosarcoma based on the precedence of bone tumorigenicity with PTH, and the two tumors were observed in the dose group with the highest bone mass increase, the lack of statistical significance, the potentially increased assay sensitivity based on use of radiography, and the high 20x exposure multiple, all suggest that these tumors are not of toxicological or clinical relevance. In addition, mechanistic data from OVX rat studies have suggested lack of osteoprogenitor proliferative activity of Scl-Ab. Hence, inclusion of the finding in the product label is not warranted.</p><p>The absence of bone tumors in this study, even at high human exposure multiples and marked bone mass increases, is in striking contrast with the bone tumor response observed with anabolic PTH-or PTHrP-related peptides. These compounds have caused osteosarcomas in <ref type="bibr">2-</ref>year rat studies at relatively low human exposure multiples based on unknown mechanism and of uncertain clinical relevance. The lack of tumors with AMG785 may be related to the transient self-limiting bone formation response. Lack of tumorigenicity of AMG785 is also suggested by other evidence including clinical data, offsetting potential limitations in the relevance of data from the AMG-785 treated rat.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reproductive Toxicity</head><p>A fertility and embryo-fetal development (FEED) study was conducted in rats at doses of 10, 60 and 300 mg/kg, equivalent to 1.5x, 19x, and 56x human exposure, based on AUC comparison. There were no effects on male or female fertility. AMG785 caused a slight increase in the incidence of reduced ventral processes on the 6th cervical vertebra at 300 mg/kg (56x human AUC), in the absence of maternal toxicity. Other adverse effects on vertebral development/ossifications were not observed. The reduction in the ventral process represents a developmental delay and was absent in pups postnatally (see PPND study). This particular anatomical structure is not present in humans. Therefore, while the finding is treatment-related, it is not considered clinically relevant and does not need to be included in the product label.</p><p>The definitive embryo-fetal development (EFD) study was conducted in rats at doses of 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg. This was equivalent to at least 5x, 17x, and 32x human exposure, based on TK data from dose range finding Study 108057 with the same doses and human PK data at 210 mg QM. In 4/25 litters in the 100 and 300 mg/kg groups each, fetuses were found to have reduced ventral processes on the 6 th cervical vertebrae, with fetal and litter incidences exceeding historical control ranges. External and skeletal malformations including syndactyly and polydactyly were observed in 7 of 16 fetuses in one of the 22 litters, at the high dose of 300 mg/kg. Some of the 7 affected fetuses also had associated skeletal malformations. Litter and fetal incidences exceeded historical control ranges in this study. The anomalies were not</p></div>

Across studies, litter incidence was 1/75, and fetal incidence was 7/1021, i.e. 0.7%. The Sponsor eventually concluded this finding was not treatment-related. However, this reviewer believes that treatment-relatedness cannot be excluded, in part based on the occurrence of syndactyly in SOST -/mice and humans with sclerosteosis. NOAEL is 100 mg/kg, or 17x human exposure. The reviewer recommends that this finding be mentioned in the product label.</p><p>In a pre-and post-natal study in rats, conducted at doses of 10, 60 and 300 mg/kg, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">equivalent  to 1.5x, 19x, and 56x</ref> human exposure, based on AUC comparison, minimal or slight but significant decreases in femoral bone mass <ref type="bibr">(vBMD, vBMC)</ref> were observed in F1 males and females at 60 and 300 mg/kg, and altered femur cortical geometry (smaller bones) was seen in males at 10, 60 and 300 mg/kg (NOAEL &lt;1.5x human exposure). Increases in bone BMD and thickness were also observed. The significance of the small bone decreases is unclear but being negative the findings constitute a slight safety concern. The changes are the opposite of those expected upon sclerostin inhibition. Lack of consistent bone mass increases might be in analogy with the delay in the postnatal development of high bone mass in SOST-/-mice until 4-8 wks of age. However, the bone decreases were not expected. Skeletal abnormalities in the 6th cervical vertebrae or digital malformations were not observed in the F1 pups. The lack of these abnormalities supports the hypothesis that the observation of reduced processes in the EFD study represented a developmental delay. There were no effects on any developmental endpoint including reproductive performance of F1 pups after lactation day 21.</p><p>Nonclinical assessment of clinical concerns An extensive discussion of theoretical safety issues and potentially increased risks of various adverse effects was included by the Sponsor in the Secondary Pharmacology section of the BLA. Based on all submitted nonclinical and clinical information and information from published literature, the weight of evidence suggested that carcinogenicity is unlikely to be a significant concern with AMG785 treatment. The issues related to osteoarthritis, vascular calcification, increased longitudinal bone growth, hyperostosis, hypercementosis, altered hematopoiesis, sarcopenia, altered glucose metabolism, and exacerbation of TNFα-mediated inflammation are also unlikely to constitute significant safety concerns for the intended clinical treatment population.</p><p>The clinical team has expressed concern about the anti-resorptive effects of romosozumab. This is based on one case each of atypical femoral fracture (AFF) and osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) in Phase 3 study 20070337 in the initial 12-month romosozumab treatment period, and one additional case of ONJ after one dose of denosumab in the second 12-month treatment period. Increases in the risks of these serious adverse events are known to be associated with long term use of anti-resorptives such as bisphosphonates and denosumab, hence the clinical concern. Indeed, histomorphometry data from clinical Study 20070337 clearly showed romosozumab-related decreases in endocortical and trabecular eroded surface, the latter to a similar extent as denosumab. Animal histomorphometry data provided similar information.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>93</head><p>An animal model for AFF does not exist. However, in long term studies in alendronate treated dogs, resorption suppression has been associated with reductions in strength parameters, particularly post-yield toughness, which indicates an increase in bone brittleness often considered an underlying cause of AFF. The bone mechanical changes may be due to lack of repair of microcracks resulting from drug-induced resorption inhibition. The Sponsor's nonclinical AMG785 studies, several of which included adequate bone strength assessments, provided strong evidence of a lack of bone quality or strength impairments. Regarding ONJ, there were no adverse effects on jaw bone in the Sponsor's chronic toxicity studies and data from a published study in a rat periodontal ligation model showed increases in alveolar bone and continued resorptive activity although clinical endpoints were not included in the study. Nevertheless, the ideal nonclinical model and the bone quality parameter(s) that are most predictive for increased risks of clinical AFF and/or ONJ are not well established.</p><p>A study to evaluate the effect of AMG785 on femoral bone strength in mice to address the concern about AFF does not seem warranted, as data from published literature suggest that Scl-Ab increases cortical bone material strength and does not cause the increase in femur brittleness observed with alendronate treatment <ref type="bibr">(Sinder et al, Bone 71: 115-123, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Misof et al, Bone 36: 150-158, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Uveges et al, JBMR 24(5): 849-859, 2009</ref>).</p><p>If the clinical team has concerns regarding the ability of romosozumab to cause osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), a nonclinical study could be conducted to examine the effects of r13c7 in a rat surgical ONJ model (refer to <ref type="bibr">Kim et al., Bone 81:442-448, 2015)</ref>. Adequate dose selection and inclusion of a bisphosphonate control arm would be recommended for such a study. Zoledronic acid treatment, in combination with dental extraction, has been shown to induce ONJ in this model, and the ONJ was accompanied by a shift in alveolar bone microcrack size to larger values. Such a nonclinical study would be useful if it could provide helpful information from a clinical or regulatory perspective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Taken together, the submitted nonclinical information is adequate and supports the safety of the proposed treatment with once-monthly subcutaneous doses of 210 mg in the intended treatment population. AMG785 was generally well tolerated by animals at doses equivalent to large human exposure multiples, and apart from indirect effects related to the pharmacological activity, little toxicity was observed. Information available from humans with sclerostin deficiency disorders or SOST knockout mice is also generally reassuring regarding bone safety, general toxicity and carcinogenicity. The embryofetal digit anomalies observed with AMG785 treatment replicate similar observations in humans and mice with sclerostin deficiencies.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Study design  Monkeys were sham-operated or OVX-ed followed by a 17-wk bone depletion period. Sham-operated monkeys were dosed s.c. with 0 mg/kg/wk for 12 months. OVX groups were given 0, 3, or 30 mg/kg/wk for 12 months, or 30/0 mg/kg for 6/6 months (recovery group).</p><p>ADA  Several animals in the 3 mg/kg weekly dosing group developed binding or neutralizing antibodies against AMG785. The result was that the initial number of 16/grp was reduced to <ref type="bibr">16,</ref><ref type="bibr">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">6,</ref><ref type="bibr">15,</ref><ref type="bibr">14</ref> in the 0, 0, 3, 30, and 30/0 (recovery) groups, respectively. (data from 6-month toxicity study 107426; from 3, 10 and 100 mg/kg dose groups). This is 2.5 to 4 times shorter than the observed half-life in humans at the 3 mg/kg dose <ref type="bibr">(12.8 days;</ref><ref type="bibr">Clinical Overview,</ref><ref type="bibr">p.19)</ref>.  Cumulative monthly monkey vs monthly human AUC multiples at 3 and 30 mg/kg are 1.3x and 22x, respectively, which would be 1.3x and 2.2x larger than multiples calculated based on mg/kg comparison (1x and 10x, respectively).The difference may be due to the fact that half-life in monkeys is less than 1/4x half-life in humans while doses were given ca. 4 more frequently in monkeys vs humans.</p><p>Bone resorption and formation  AMG785 transiently increased overall skeletal bone formation and resorption indicated by serum or urine circulating bone biomarkers. The increases were largest at 3 months (the earliest sampling time point) and decreased thereafter. However, markers were still increased as compared to OVX controls after 12 months. Effects were approx. 2.5-fold larger for formation marker P1NP vs resorption marker CTx. The formation increase was due to the primary pharmacologic effect of AMG785 to neutralize sclerostin and prevent inhibition of osteoblastic bone matrix deposition and mineralization.  The resorption increase was probably related to the AMG-induced increase in serum PTH. The increase in resorption markers was also transient but, like the increase in</p></div>

The PTH increase most likely reflected an attempt to compensate for hypocalcemia caused by osteoblastic bone mineral formation. PTH is known to stimulate Haversian (intracortical) bone remodeling and can increase cortical porosity. These events were confirmed by an early increase in H.BFR and small increases in Po.Ar in rib cortex (histomorphometry, see below).  Serum calcium was slightly decreased.</p><p>Densitometry DXA (spine, femur, tibia and radius)</p><p> OVX led to expected decreases in DXA parameters BMD, Bone Area and BMC at cancellous and cortical bone sites.  AMG increased bone mass evidenced by dose-related increases in BMC, Area and/or BMC in whole body, lumbar spine and long bones, including proximal tibia, proximal and distal femur, and distal radius. Increases occurred in both cancellous and cortical long bone regions.  Increases were most prominent in the first 6 months, but continued thereafter.  At 12 months, parameters usually exceeded sham levels at both 3 and 30 mg/kg doses.  Upon recovery, the effects in the 30 mg/kg group were reversed to the levels achieved in the 3 mg/kg or sham group.  Extent, time-dependence and dose-dependence of the AMG effects on DXA parameters were different for different bone sites and regions.  PQCT confirmed increases in trabecular BMD in metaphyseal part of proximal tibia and distal radius.</p><p>pQCT (tibia and radius, meta-and diaphysis) o OVX caused decreases in trabecular and cortical/subcortical BMD and BMC, and cortical thinning due to decrease in bone width with no change in medullary area. o In proximal tibia and distal radius metaphysis, AMG increased total bone area/width, trabecular and (sub)cortical BMD and BMC. Effects were more pronounced in tibia. o In proximal tibia and distal radius diaphysis, total area and periosteal circumference were slightly increased (effect in radius &gt; in tibia), and cortical thickness was increased. Cortical BMD was increased in tibia. However it was transiently decreased in distal radius. In tibial diaphysis, endosteal circumference was decreased but in radius diaphysis endosteal circumference was slightly increased. PQCT of proximal or mid femur was not performed. It is not clear whether any other bones respond to AMG785 in a similar way as cortical bone of distal radius. The cause of the decrease in cortical BMD with AMG785 is not clear. It may in part be due to increased cortical remodeling and porosity, although the histomorphometry data are not entirely consistent with this interpretation. PTH receptor agonists also cause a slight decrease in BMD of the mostly cortical distal radius, possibly due to increased cortical porosity. o AMG generally restored bone parameters to sham levels at 3 mg/kg and above sham levels at 30 mg/kg.</p></div>

AMG effects in femur diaphysis included increased BMC and BMD, increased cortical thickness and decreased endosteal circumference. Cortical BMD was not affected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Micro-CT (ex vivo)</head><p> Micro-CT after 52 wks showed that AMG785 increased L3 trabecular parameters (vBMD, BMC, Tb.Th and/or Tb.N, Bone Area, BV/TV) in a dose-related manner. Changes were similar in vertebral bodies and cores. AMG785 also increased vertebral cortical bone vBMD, BMC, area, and thickness.  Tissue BMD was decreased by AMG in vertebral trabecular and cortical regions. This may be related to increased bone porosity, or it may be a technical artefact.  In femoral neck, AMG785 effects were similar to those in L3 trabecular bone.  AMG785 did not significantly affect humerus cortical porosity or tissue BMD.  The AMG785-induced decrease in L3 SMI probably indicated a change to a more plate-like trabecular structure.  In the 30 mg/kg recovery group, the AMG785-induced changes were partially reversed to levels achieved in the 3 mg/kg group (cortical part of L3) or levels intermediate between OVX and 3 mg/kg groups (trabecular part of L3).  Data were consistent with densitometric and histomorphometric results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biomechanical testing</head><p> AMG increased bone strength parameters of the femur shaft. Effects were dose-related with some statistically significant at 30 mg/kg. Effects included increases in peak load, yield load, stiffness, AUC and (postyield)-toughness.  The intrinsic cortical bone strength (material strength) of the humerus cortical beam was not significantly affected by AMG.  AMG increased the strength (peak load, stiffness, AUC) of the femoral neck, consistent with significant increase in ex vivo DXA proximal femur BMD and BMC.  AMG increased bone strength parameters in lumbar vertebrae bodies and cores, with most effects statistically significant at both 3 and 30 mg/kg. Effects included increases in peak load, yield load, stiffness, AUC and (postyield)-toughness.  For femur shaft and vertebrae, correlations between ex vivo densitometric measures of bone mass (BMC or BMD) and bone strength (peak load or apparent strength) were very good and statistically significant. For femoral neck, there was a reasonably good significant correlation between BMC and peak load (except for the 3 mg/kg group of N=6).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>164</head><p> In vertebral L3+L4 bodies, bone quality appeared to be increased vs sham and OVX groups at 30 mg/kg, when bone quality was defined as the slope of the regression line between ex vivo BMC and peak load (ie as BMD increases strength increased more in 30 mg/kg vs other groups).  There was no indication of an adverse effect of AMG treatment on bone quality or integrity. All bone strength parameters were positively affected by AMG treatment, at least after 12 months of treatment, and correlated significantly with densitometric measures. However, bone strength measurements in the current study were carried out after the 12-month treatment period only. Based on the marked decrease of endocortical resorption and the increase in cortical porosity during the initial weeks of treatment, not yet accompanied by significant endocortical and/or periosteal bone deposition, there may be a transient period of cortical bone mechanical vulnerability. However, data from the 6-month monkey Study 118025, in which meta-and diaphyseal distal radius and tibia were evaluated in more detail, allayed this concern at least to some extent. Mechanical strength may also be correlated to other aspects of bone quality that were not evaluated in the animal studies.</p></div>

Increases in osteoid and osteoblast surfaces were only apparent in Wk 13. The structural changes were due to the expected stimulatory effect of AMG on trabecular bone formation, particularly in the first few weeks/months of treatment.  Eroded surface in AMG treated animals decreased from 20% to 16-10% <ref type="bibr">in Wk 13 (ilium)</ref> only. This decrease was not seen at 6 months or later. At 52 weeks, there was a slight increase in ES/BS in vertebral bone.  AMG increased Wall Thickness in <ref type="bibr">Wk 13 and 27 (Ilium)</ref> and Wk 52 <ref type="bibr">(FN, vert)</ref> indicating positive bone balance at the BRU level.  AcF was increased (ie stimulation of remodeling), significantly in Wk 13.  At the human equivalent dose of 3 mg/kg, significant effects included changes in trabecular parameters (e.g. Tb.Th), BV/TV, BFR and formative/quiescent surface ratio.</p><p>Cortical bone of rib and femur diaphysis  AMG markedly increased BFR rates at endosteal surfaces, Haversian and periosteal surfaces, particularly in Wk 13 (rib).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>165</head><p>formative/quiescent perimeter fractions indicated modeling rather than remodeling at the endocortical surface.  AMG increased total and cortical area%, and cortical width of rib and femoral diaphysis, mainly at 30 mg/kg at Wk 52. Medullary area% was decreased in both bones, especially at later time points, consistent with pQCT data.  At the Haversian surface, H.BFR was also enhanced at <ref type="bibr">Wk 13 and 27 (rib)</ref> and Po.Ar % (porosity) was slightly increased in Wk 27 and 52 (rib and femur). Rib and femur medullary areas were both decreased by AMG treatment at 3 and 30 mg/kg, similar to that in the tibia according to pQCT.  The slight AMG-induced increase in endosteal circumference in distal radius (pQCT data) suggests that resorption outperformed formation at this bone surface. There were no morphometric data for the distal radius to provide information.  Bone width (TtTAr) at 3 mg/kg was only slightly affected at Wk 52, while periosteal BFR was markedly increased particularly early in treatment. This suggested a parallel increase in resorption at the periosteal surface. However, based on the actual BFR numbers and the relatively small total periosteal skeletal surface this resorption probably did not contribute much to the increase in average skeletal resorption.  The histomorphometry data showed that the increases in resorption markers (NTx, CTx) were probably due, for the most part, to an early enhancement of Haversian/intracortical bone resorption, possibly with some contribution of periosteal resorption, and of trabecular resorption at later time points. The increase in resorption was likely to be PTH-dependent.  The increases in formation markers were due to enhanced bone formation at trabecular (mostly) and cortical bone surfaces. The latter probably included mostly Haversian and endocortical surfaces but also periosteal surfaces. This is based on control BFR/BS values at different cortical surfaces (endocortical &gt; Haversian &gt; periosteal) and probable relative sizes of these surfaces (Haversian &gt; endocortical and periosteal).  <ref type="figure">-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</ref>--This is a representation of an electronic record that was signed electronically and this page is the manifestation of the electronic signature. </p></div>

Although this variation is often considered to represent a developmental delay (development of the ventral processes of the cervical vertebrae proceed in an anterior to posterior direction and the ventral processes on the 7th cervical vertebrae have not started to develop at gestation day 21), this interpretation should be made with caution in the absence of any generalized developmental delay and in the absence of toxicity.

Romosozumab is expected to increase bone formation and bone mass. The sought indication for the BLA is the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Romosozumab was evaluated in Phase III studies in postmenopausal women at a dose of 210 mg by subcutaneous injection every month (QM). The intended treatment duration is 1 year.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Survival/Mortality: twice daily</head><p>There were 36-43 rats per sex per group died or were euthanized prior to the end of the treatment period (Week 91 males; Week 98 females). Among these unscheduled deaths, in both control and treated animals, common findings were noted (neoplastic findings: pituitary gland adenoma, mammary gland fibroadenoma/adenocarcinoma; non-neoplastic findings: kidney nephropathy and heart cardiomyopathy).</p><p>With regards to neoplastic findings, pituitary gland adenoma (pars distalis) was the most common cause of death in both genders. AMG 785 treatment had no effect on the incidence of fatal pituitary adenoma compared to the vehicle control group. A higher incidence of fatal mammary gland adenocarcinoma was noted in females of the 10 mg/kg/dose (13.88%) and 50 mg/kg/dose (18.6%) dose group compared to the vehicle control females (5%). However, such increased incidence was not statistically significant by trend or pairwise comparison tests. Mammary gland neoplasms, including adenocarcinoma, are frequently encountered in Sprague-Dawley rats and the lack of relationship to AMG 785 treatment was further supported by the lack of a continuum of pre-neoplastic to neoplastic changes. The incidence of fibroadenoma and adenocarcinoma observed in this study are within the range reported for these two tumors in the in-house historical data.</p><p>With regards to non-neoplastic findings, common age-related renal (nephropathy) and cardiac (cardiomyopathy) degenerative changes were the most frequent non-neoplastic cause of death in this study and incidence was similar across control and AMG 785</p><p>Page 13 of 41</p><p>The TK analysis of retained animals showed that the mean serum AMG785 at 3, 10, and 50 mg/kg were 4.91, 74.6, and 836 µg/mL in retained females and 9.66, 79.5, and 589 µg/mL in retained males, respectively. There were no gender differences (≤ 2-fold) in mean AMG785 serum concentrations at Week 13.</p><p>Among ADA-positive retained animals, 1 female at 50 mg/kg had serum AMG 785 concentration of 282 µg/mL (3.0 fold lower than mean serum AMG 785 concentration of ADA negative female rats) and 31 male rats had serum AMG785 concentrations of 8.31, 63, and 310 µg/mL, at 3, 10, and 50 mg/kg respectively, which were lower than the mean serum AMG785 concentration of ADA negative males; 10.2, 80.4, and 653 µg/mL at 3, 10, and 50 mg/kg, respectively). At 50 mg/kg, ADA positive males had 2.1-fold lower mean AMG785 serum concentration when compared to ADA negative males, indicating the minimal difference.</p><p>Page 18 of 41</p><p>In summary, the weekly subcutaneous administration of AMG 785 at 3, 10 or 50 mg/kg for a minimum of 91 weeks for males and 98 weeks for females resulted in expected pharmacological effects on bones (increased skeletal radiopacity (whole body), and increased bone mass and geometry at the femur metaphysis and diaphysis at all dose levels).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gross Pathology: At necropsy</head><p>There were AMG785-related macroscopic findings in bones (miscellaneous, calvarium femur, lumbar vertebrae L5-L6, sternum and tibia) and spleen. There was also AMG785related thickening of the bone in males and females, in a dose dependent manner, correlating with the increase in bone mineral content (BMC by ex vivo pQCT) and hyperostosis microscopically. This effect was systemic, usually affecting all routinely collected bones.</p><p>An increased incidence of spleen enlargement was noted in females at  3 mg/kg and in males at 10 mg/kg/dose, correlating with increased extramedullary hematopoiesis microscopically.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Histopathology: At necropsy [Peer Review: Yes]</head><p>Neoplastic There were two tumors, renal lipoma in females and adrenal cortical adenoma in males, where incidence reached statistical significance.</p><p>With renal lipoma, a rare tumor, there was a statistically significant increase in females only, by trend test (p =0.0486). The incidence of renal lipoma was marginally increased in females at 50 mg/kg/dose when compared to concurrent control, and marginally above the historical data range for the testing facility. However, this finding was not considered AMG-785 related due low incidence, lack of pre-neoplastic precursors lesions and comparable nature and morphology to the renal lipoma in the concurrent control female.</p><p>Page 19 of 41</p><p>With adrenal cortical adenoma, a common tumor, there was a slight increase in males only, by pairwise comparisons test (0 vs. 10 mg/kg; p = 0.0169). However, this finding was not considered AMG 785-related due to the incidence being within historical control data range, the absence of a dose-related trend, and the absence of a precursor preneoplastic change.</p><p>In addition, other common tumors with numerical imbalances were benign pheochromocytoma and thyroid c-cell adenoma in females at 3 mg/kg/dose and keratoacanthoma in the skin of the males at 10 mg/kg. However, the presence of these tumors showed lack of statistical significance (for common tumors, by pairwise comparisons), lack of relationship of these imbalances to AMG 785 treatment, absence of a dose-response relationship, and absence of precursor pre-neoplastic change. These incidences of the tumors were also within historical control data range. In addition, the incidences of pancreatic tumors seemed to be increased at 10 and 50 mg/kg/dose. However, they were within historical control for both males and females. its cause of death (a local extension in the brain). Bone neoplasms and osteosarcomas (OSA) are rare in Sprague-Dawley rats. The incidence of spontaneous OSA in male and females Sprague-Dawley rats in two years studies conducted at the test facility ranged from 0 to 3.33%. The incidence of OSA in males at 50 mg/kg was 3.7%, marginally higher than the historical range. However, the sponsor argues that this historical data is based on studies where whole body radiography was not conducted and detection of OSA was limited to microscopic evaluation of sternum and macroscopic abnormalities.</p></div>

There were no other bone tumors in this study contrasting with results of long term administration of PTH in F344 and Sprague-Dawley rats that resulted in OSA, osteoblastoma, osteoma, and osteoblast hyperplasia. In the end, the sponsor considered the OSA observed in males at 50 mg/kg as spontaneous based on the low incidence that falls within the range of reported OSA in the historical data of the test facility, late onset and solitary nature and lack of a continuum that includes proliferative precursor osteoblastic changes and benign bone tumors.</p><p>Note 1: Detailed summary of neoplastic findings and historical data provided by the sponsor are included in Appendix.</p><p>Note 2: Osteosarcomas have been seen in all rodent carcinogenicity studies with PTH and its related peptides.

There was no woven bone or other morphological changes, indicating altered bone quality. The hyperostosis was of comparable severity between bone sites (femur, tibia, L5-L6, calvarium) of the same animal, except for the sternum which was generally affected to a lesser degree. In addition, at comparable doses, it was generally more pronounced in females when compared to males. Higher femoral metaphyseal BMD was observed in females when compared to males.</p><p>Splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis was noted in both sexes with increased incidence/severity at  3 mg/kg, correlating with the macroscopic observation of spleen enlargement. Hepatic extramedullary hematopoiesis was observed in males at  3 mg/kg and in females at  10 mg/kg. The splenic and hepatic extramedullary hematopoiesis was considered compensatory and secondary to the reduced bone marrow space as a consequence of the generalized bone hyperostosis.</p></div>

The proposed dosing regimen is 210 mg romosozumab administered subcutaneously once every month for 12 doses in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. Age: Not given Weight: Not given Satellite groups: N/A Unique study design: N/A Deviation from study protocol: 1) *Due to an error in the certificate of analysis for the AMG 785 CPD material, animals in the CPD treatment group received 2.75 mg/kg instead of the targeted 3 mg/kg AMG 785 (~91.5% of the nominal dose). The certificates of analysis were not provided in the report. Also study report notes an actual concentration AMG785 CPD as 118 mg/mL but the COA was not available for confirmation. Additionally, no formulation information was provided. 2) One animal from FIH treatment group (C38468) had no measurable drug exposure and was excluded entirely from all analyses and summary statistics. Reviewer Comment: These deviations were determined to not significantly impact the outcome of the study. See further discussion below.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective</head><p>This non-GLP study was conducted to determine the relative bioavailability of two AMG 785 treatments (i.e., FIH and CPD) when administered as a single subcutaneous injection to naïve male cynomolgus monkeys. The FIH and CPD treatments differ in formulation and are made using different AMG 785 manufacturing processes (i.e., Process 1 and Process 2 materials, respectively).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>The study report states that serum samples for PK analysis were collected from each animal at pre-dose and at <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">12,</ref><ref type="bibr">24,</ref><ref type="bibr">48,</ref><ref type="bibr">72,</ref><ref type="bibr">96,</ref><ref type="bibr">144,</ref><ref type="bibr">192,</ref><ref type="bibr">240,</ref><ref type="bibr">312,</ref><ref type="bibr">408</ref>, and 504 hours post-dose. Serum AMG 785 concentrations were determined using a validated ELISA (MET-000018 v 4.0) with a lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 22.9 or 50.0 ng/mL. Serum samples for antibody analysis were collected and analyzed for the presence of binding and neutralizing antibodies using a validated immunoassay.</p><p>The study report did not provide information on the drug product formulation, certificates of analysis, or dosing solution analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reviewer Comments:</head><p>The validated ELISA method (MET-000018 v 5.0 and Study 108574) indicates that the LLOQ for this method is 50 ng/mL and the upper limit of quantitation (ULOQ) is 2500 ng/mL. It is unclear from the study report what the "LLOQ of 22.9 or 50.0 ng/mL" is referring to as described.</p><p>Additionally, the study report methods section states that serum samples were analyzed for binding and neutralizing antibodies; however, no method was given or results discussed or presented in the report. One monkey in the FIH group (Animal No. C38468) did not have measureable AMG 785 exposure at any time point; however, as the other 9 monkeys in this group had measurable AMG 785 serum exposure that was relatively similar over the 504-hour observation period, it is unlikely that neutralizing antibodies greatly influenced the study outcome. Therefore, the absence of data on binding and neutralizing antibody formation from the study report does not preclude the review of this study.</p><p>The study report provided lot numbers for the FIH and CPD treatments of 00089336 and 0010039243, respectively. The lot numbers given for FIH and CPD were determined to be nonclinical drug product batches representing the Process 1 drug substance formulation and the Process 2 drug substance formulation, respectively, based on information obtained from Section 3.2.P.2.3: Lot History -Manufacturing Details [Process 1 Vial] and [Process 2 Vial]. The drug product lot indicated for FIH (i.e., 00089336) was also used in the 6-month rat and monkey subcutaneous toxicity studies. The drug product lot indicated for CPD (i.e., 0010039243) appears to only have been used to represent the Process 2 drug substance formulation for this PK bridging study.</p><p>Based on the Quality Overall Summary: Drug Product: Formulation Development (Section 3.2.P.2.2), Process 1 and Process 2 differ in both the manufacturing process utilized as well as product formulation.</p><p>The drug products formulations are stated as follows:</p></div>

The study report notes the following deviation: "After an in-life portion of the study, it was discovered the certificate of analysis for the CPD material contained an error. The AMG 785 concentration was actually 118 mg/mL instead of the indicated 129 mg/mL. As a result, animals in the CPD treatment group received 2.75 mg/kg AMG 785 instead of the targeted 3 mg/kg (approximately 91.5% of the nominal dose)." The lack of both certificates of analysis and dosing solution analysis preclude the ability to confirm the stated AMG 785 concentrations for the FIH and CPD treatments. Upon review, it has been determined that this deviation did not adversely affect the results of this study. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">Figure 2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> present the AMG 785 Concentration-Time profile on a semi-log and linear scale, respectively (excerpted from sponsor's submission).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Observations and Results</head><p>Due to the error in dosing concentrations, a slightly higher dose of 3.0 mg/kg AMG 785 FIH (Process 1) was administered as compared to AMG 785 CPD (Process 2) at 2.75 mg/kg. Therefore, the absolute difference between the FIH and CPD doses was approximately 8% or approximately 91.5% of the target nominal dose for CPD.</p><p>The systemic exposure of a single-dose of FIH given at 3 mg/kg was found to be slightly greater than the systemic exposure of a single-dose of CPD given at 2.75 mg/kg. The absolute values for mean C max and AUC indicate a difference of -11% and -17%, respectively, between the FIH-and CPD-treated animals. When corrected for the difference in dose, the mean C max and AUC indicate a difference of -2.5% and approximately -10%, respectively, between the FIH-and CPD-treated animals.</p><p>Additionally, the mean T max value for the CPD-treated animals was earlier, at approximately 24 hours post-dose, as compared to the FIH-treated animals that occurred at 48 hours post-dose.</p><p>Reference ID: 4063752</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">(b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4) (b) (4)</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and Conclusions</head><p>This non-GLP study was conducted to determine the relative bioavailability of AMG 785 Process 1 drug substance formulation (FIH) and AMG 785 Process 2 drug substance formulation (CPD) when administered as a single 3 mg/kg subcutaneous injection to naïve male cynomolgus monkeys. However, due to a dosing error the CPD-treated group received an AMG 785 dose of 2.75 mg/kg. Therefore, the PK parameters C max and AUC were reviewed from both the perspective of absolute values as well as dose normalized values.</p><p>The differences observed between AMG 785 systemic exposures in male monkeys administered either a single SC dose of FIH at 3 mg/kg or CPD at 2.75 mg/kg were within 17% when comparing absolute C max and AUC values and within 10% when C max and AUC values were normalized for dose.</p><p>The study report states that "It is likely that raw systemic exposure values between FIH and CPD treatments would have been more similar (&lt;10% different) if equivalent doses were given. A comparison of systemic exposures parameters were made after dose normalization and expressed as a ratio. It is known that the pharmacokinetics of AMG 785 are greater than dose proportional; and thus a linear correction via dose normalization will under correct for the difference in dose and the actual difference in systemic exposure between treatments is likely less than that reflected in the ratio of dose normalized parameters."</p><p>In the 6-month SC repeat-dose cynomolgus monkey study (Study 107426) which used the same AMG 785 Process 1 lot (i.e., Lot # 00089336) as in the current study, the results indicated that serum exposure to AMG 785 increased in a slightly greater than dose proportional manner between the doses of 3 to 100 mg/kg/day on Day 1 of dosing and that the mean T max for all doses examined was 48 hours post-dose for male monkeys (see the Nonclinical review of Dr. Andreasen, IND 103077, dated June 18, 2009). It is plausible that the remaining difference in exposure between CPD and FIH after dose normalization could be a result of the greater than dose proportional PK for AMG 785, as was observed in the 6-month monkey toxicity study. Therefore, the differences observed between the systemic exposure after a single SC dose of 3 mg/kg FIH and 2.75 mg/kg CPD are considered acceptably similar from the nonclinical perspective.</p><p>Additionally, the mean T max shift noted in the CPD-treated group towards an earlier time point of 24 hours fell within the T max range for FIH-treated animals (i.e., 24-72 hours) and is not considered a concern at this time for a subcutaneously administered drug product.</p><p>Furthermore, the comparability between the Process 1 and Process 2 drug substance and drug product were evaluated by the Product Quality Team under the IND and NDA and the information provided was considered adequate to establish comparability between Process 1 and Process 2 drug substance formulations from the Product Quality perspective (see discussion under Section 2.3 Drug Formulation above). This provides evidence that the manufacturing and formulation changes made between Process 1 and Process 2 did not significantly alter the drug product quality.</p></div>

A total of 245 subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive romosozumab (N = 163) or placebo (N = 82) for 12 months and followed for an additional 3 months after completion of the double-blind period for evaluation of safety and immunogenicity. No follow-on therapy was administered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Safety Population and Endpoint</head><p>The analysis population was the safety population, which included all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of either romosozumab, placebo, or alendronate in the 12-month double-blind study period. The main safety endpoint of interest was major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as a composite endpoint of CV death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. CV serious adverse events (CV SAEs) was the secondary endpoint of interest and was a composite endpoint of the following: death, cardiac ischemic events (MI, angina, coronary revascularization), cerebrovascular events (stroke, transient ischemic attack), noncoronary revascularization, hospitalization for heart failure, and peripheral vascular event not requiring revascularization. CV death included fatal events adjudicated as cardiovascular-related or undetermined. CV adverse events were adjudicated by the Duke University Clinical Research Institute (DCRI) and re-adjudicated by Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Study Group. Because the DCRI and TIMI adjudications yielded similar results, the review is focused on the original DCRI-adjudication rather than the post-hoc TIMI-adjudication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Statistical Methods</head><p>The sponsor submitted a statistical analysis plan for the CCR on April 23, 2018, and submitted the CCR on June 28, 2018. The sponsor analyzed the outcome of interest, the time to the first occurrence of MACE, using a Cox regression model for each study. Subjects who did not have MACE in the double-blind period were censored either by loss to follow-up or at the end of double-blind period. In the analysis of the individual components of MACE, subjects were not censored when they experienced another type of CV event. The sponsor conducted the analysis using the double-blind 12-month period and the overall study period. The sponsor used the same model to analyze the CV SAEs. Also, the sponsor conducted a meta-analysis of the three studies, which compared the combined alendronate and placebo arms to the romosozumab group.</p><p>In addition to the sponsor's analysis, the reviewer conducted a meta-analysis only using the two studies in women (Studies 337 and 142), the indicated population. This meta-analysis did not distinguish the effect of the active control, alendronate, on the outcomes from the placebo effect, nor does it directly compare alendronate and placebo. Therefore, the reviewer conducted a network meta-analysis which compares multiple treatments simultaneously in a single analysis by combining direct and indirect evidence within a network of randomized controlled trials. Therefore, the analysis provides estimates that compare romosozumab to placebo and alendronate to placebo. The network meta-analyses were conducted on MACE and CV SAE events. The analysis used the same censoring criteria used in the sponsor's analyses. Additionally, the reviewer conducted network meta-analysis on individual components of MACE. The reviewer conducted two network meta-analyses based on fixed-effects models; univariate analysis with treatment group adjusted only and multivariate analysis with treatment group and age adjusted and stratified by countries.</p></div>

One phase 3 studies was designed to demonstrate superiority of romosozumab 210 mg in 70 mg/ml concentration compared to placebo, while the second study was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of romosozumab 210 mg in 90 mg/ml concentration, the intended dose for marketing, to romosozumab 210 mg in 70 mg/ml concentration.</p><p>The key efficacy endpoints were the reduction in the incidence of new vertebral fractures and increase in the bone mineral density (BMD) after 12 and 24 months of treatment. FDA analysis shows that treatment with romosozumab 210 mg (70 mg/ml concentration) compared to placebo reduced the risk of new vertebral fracture by 73% and 76%, at 12 and 24 month, respectively. Compared to placebo, treatment with romosozumab also significantly increased BMD at lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck through 12 and 24 months.</p><p>The analysis further shows that romosozumab 210 mg in 90 mg/ml concentration was non-inferior to romosozumab 210 mg in 70 mg/ml concentration with respect to the percent change in BMD at lumbar spine.</p><p>The two studies provide evidence demonstrating the efficacy of romosozumab for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women at increased risk of fracture.</p></div>

The proposed dose for marketing is 210 mg (90 mg/mL solution) subcutaneously once every month for 12 doses in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm by a healthcare professional.</p><p>According to the Applicant: Romosozumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits sclerostin, a negative regulator of bone formation. Romosozumab has a dual effect on bone, increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption. Romosozumab increases trabecular and cortical bone mass and improves bone structure and strength.</p><p>This statistical review is based on two pivotal phase 3 studies (20070337 and 20120156). <ref type="table" target="#tab_87">Table 1</ref> presents a brief summary of both studies. </p></div>

The model included the treatment as the main effect and age and prevalent vertebral fracture as covariates. The odds ratio and the corresponding 95% 2-sided confidence interval and p-values using a score test were provided. Point estimates of absolute risk reduction (difference in proportions, control -treatment), risk ratio (ratio of proportions, treatment over control) and the relative risk reduction (100*(1-risk ratio)) as well as the corresponding 95% confidence intervals were also calculated via the Mantel-Haenszel method, adjusting for age and prevalent vertebral fracture strata.</p><p>The secondary fracture efficacy endpoints (i.e., incidences of non-vertebral fracture, clinical fracture, major nonvertebral fracture, major osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture) through months 12 and 24 were analyzed using the full analysis set. The cumulative incidence of fractures was summarized using the Kaplan-Meier estimates, and the hazard ratios and the confidence intervals for the risk reduction relative to placebo were based on the stratified Cox proportional hazards model.</p><p>The percent changes from baseline in lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck by DXA at month 12 and month 24 were analyzed using the ANCOVA model with LOCF imputation using the primary efficacy analysis set for BMD and PRO/ClinRO endpoints. The ANCOVA model included treatment, age and prevalent vertebral fracture strata (stratification factors), and baseline value of the endpoint. Additional covariates of machine type and machine type-by-baseline value interaction were also included in the model to adjust for the effect of machine type on baseline value for parameters derived by DXA.</p></div>

The incidence of new vertebral fracture was 0.5% in the romo group compared to 1.8% in the placebo group (P-value: &lt;0.001) through Month 12. The relative risk reduction in new vertebral fracture was 73% in patients receiving romo compared to placebo. The incidence of new vertebral fracture was 0.6% in the romo/denosumab group compared to 2.5% in the placebo/denosumab group (P-value: &lt;0.001) through Month 24. The relative risk reduction in new vertebral fracture was 75% in patients receiving romo/denosumab compared to placebo/denosumab. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Fracture and Non-vertebral Fracture</head><p>The study protocol pre-defined the clinical fractures as non-vertebral fractures and clinical (i.e. symptomatic) vertebral fractures. <ref type="table" target="#tab_92">Table 6</ref> shows that non-vertebral fractures accounted for more than 85% of clinical fractures.</p><p>The incidence of clinical fracture was 1.6% in the romo group compared to 2.5% in the placebo group (P-value: 0.008) through Month 12. Romo significantly reduced the risk of clinical fractures by 36% (95% CI: 11%, 54%) through Month 12.</p><p>Following the pre-specified testing sequence for type I error control, the incidence of non-vertebral fracture through month 12 and subject incidence of non-vertebral fracture through month 24 did not show statistically significant difference between the romo and placebo groups. No further testing on other endpoints proceeded from this point per the pre-specified testing sequence.</p><p>The incidence rate difference for clinical fractures between romo and placebo was mainly due to the difference for the clinical vertebral fractures, which were already included in the primary efficacy endpoint. Therefore, we believe that clinical fracture may not be an appropriate endpoint for fracture risk evaluation.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">Table 10</ref>-2 in study report.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Survival Analysis</head><p>The statistical analyses for mortality data were performed for each sex separately. The survival function of each group was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method applied on daily intervals and graphs were produced. Any animal with accidental injury that causes its death or its unscheduled sacrifice was censored in the estimation. In addition, all animals still alive at the end of the experimental period were censored at the following day.</p><p>The log-rank test was applied to the four groups in order to assess the significance of the overall group effect on mortality data. When significant differences among groups (p ≤ 0.05) were revealed, then the significance of an overall dose-related trend in mortality across all groups was evaluated using Tarone's method. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">4</ref> Using the Multtest procedure (SAS/STAT), Tarone's test was implemented as a Peto two-sided test, with all uncensored deaths coded as 2 and all censored deaths coded as 0. The corresponding arithmetic dose level scores (0, 3, 10, and 50) was used to perform the overall trend test. Furthermore, the vehicle control group was compared to each of the other three groups using a Peto two-sided test. The sign of the statistic was used to indicate if either an increase or a decrease of the mortality rate across dose levels was observed for the trend test and each pairwise comparison.</p><p>Sponsor's concluded: The numbers of death were listed in follow table. The test results show no significance for both male and female datasets, with p-value = 0.9751 and p-value = 0.5922 respectively. Therefore, no post-hoc testing was done for these datasets, that is neither Tarone's trend test 4 nor the pairwise comparisons were performed.</p><p>[Source: page 55 of study report of 107895.pdf]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.1.2</head><p>Tumor Data Analysis Neoplastic findings classified as fatal and incidental were processed using the death rate method and the prevalence method, respectively. The processing of incidental tumors was done by creating a single separate interval for the time period following the experimental period (terminal sacrifice period) and by dividing the experimental period into the following fixed intervals: 1-52 weeks, 53-78 weeks, 79-90 weeks for males, and 1-52 weeks, 53-78 weeks, 79-92 weeks, 92-97 for females. Using the derived outcomes from the processing of both fatal and incidental tumors, a test statistic was built to perform a global survival-adjusted trend test (Peto's test) on tumor data observed in a "mortality dependent" context. <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">5</ref> For each data set within each sex, the significance of an overall linear dose-related increase in tumor occurrence rates across the four groups was evaluated using Peto's survival-adjusted one-tailed test. The corresponding arithmetic dose level scores (0, 3, 10, and 50) was used to perform the overall trend test. Furthermore, Peto's upper-tailed test was used to check if the tumor rate in each test item treated group was significantly higher than the one in the vehicle control group. When performing a pairwise comparison, only the data corresponding to the two compared groups were submitted to the statistical analysis.</p><p>Adjustment for multiple testing: As mentioned by <ref type="bibr">Lin 6</ref> , the discrete permutation distribution was used to compute the corresponding p-value for each statistical test performed on a dataset containing 10 or less tumor occurrences. Each trend test (the overall trend and the pairwise comparison tests) was conducted at the 5% significance level but was discussed in the statistical report according to the tumor prevalence classification (common or rare) and the FDA's recommendations. More precisely, given that this chronic study is in only one species, significance of the results for common and rare tumors were respectively discussed at 0.01 and 0.05 levels for the overall trend test, and at 0.025 and 0.10 levels for the pairwise comparisons.</p><p>Sponsor's concluded: There was no neoplastic change attributed to the weekly administration of AMG 785.</p><p>There was a statistically significant increase in renal lipoma, a rare tumor, by trend test (p =0.0486 versus cutoff of p&lt;=0.05), in females only. The incidence of renal lipoma was marginally increased in females at 50 mg/kg/dose compared to concurrent control and marginally above the testing facility historical data range and reported literature.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.2.1</head><p>Survival Analysis The survival distributions of rats in all treatment groups were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. For control, low, medium, and high dose groups, the dose response relationship was tested using the likelihood ratio test and the homogeneity of survival distributions was tested using the log-rank test. The Kaplan-Meier curves for survival rates are given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 1A and 1B</ref> in the appendix for male and female rats, respectively. The intercurrent mortality data are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_87">Tables 1A and 1B</ref> in the appendix for male and female rats, respectively. Results of the tests for dose response relationship and homogeneity of survivals, are given in Tables 1A and 1B in the appendix for male and female rats, respectively.</p><p>Reviewer's findings: All surviving animals were terminated at Week 91 for males and 98 for females. This reviewer's analysis showed the numbers (percent) of death were 40 (67%), 41 (68%), 40 (67%), and 38 (70%) in male rats and 40 (67%), 39 (65%), 36 (60%), and 43 (72%) in female rats in the VC, LD, MD, and HD groups, respectively. The tests did not show any statistically significant dose response relationships or pairwise comparisons in mortality in male or female rats.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.2.2</head><p>Tumor Data Analysis The tumor data were analyzed for dose response relationships and pairwise comparisons of control group with each of the treated groups. Both the dose response relationship tests and pairwise comparisons were performed using the Poly-k method described in the paper of Bailer and Portier <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> and Bieler and Williams <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[2]</ref>. In this method an animal that lives the full study period ( max w ) or dies before the terminal sacrifice but develops the animals live up to the end of the study or if each animal that dies before the terminal sacrifice develops at least one tumor, otherwise the adjusted group size is less than N. These adjusted group sizes are then used for the dose response relationship (or the pairwise) tests using the Cochran-Armitage test. One critical point for Poly-k test is the choice of the appropriate value of k, which depends on the tumor incidence pattern with the increased dose. For long term 104 week standard rat and mouse studies, a value of k=3 is suggested in the literature. Hence, this reviewer used k=3 for the analysis of this data. For the calculation of p-values the exact permutation method was used. The tumor rates and the p-values of the tested tumor types are listed in Tables 3A and 3B in the appendix for male and female rats, respectively.</p><p>Multiple testing adjustment: For the adjustment of multiple testing of dose response relationship, the FDA guidance for the carcinogenicity study design and data analysis suggests the use of test levels α=0.005 for common tumors and α=0.025 for rare tumors for a submission with two chronic studies in species, and a significance level α=0.01 for common tumors and α=0.05 for rare tumors for a submission with one chronic study species in order to keep the false-positive rate at the nominal level of approximately 10%. A rare tumor is defined as one in which the published spontaneous tumor rate is less than 1%. For multiple pairwise comparisons of treated group with control the FDA guidance suggested the use of test levels α=0.01 for common tumors and α=0.05 for rare tumors for a submission with two chronic studies in two species, in order to keep the false-positive rate at the nominal level of approximately 10% for both submissions with two or one species.</p><p>It should be noted that the FDA guidance for multiple testing for dose response relationship is based on a publication by Lin and Rahman <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. In this work the authors investigated the use of this rule for Peto analysis. However, in a later work Lin and Rahman <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> showed that this rule for multiple testing for dose response relationship is also suitable for Poly-K tests.</p><p>The tumor rates and the p-values of the tested tumor types are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Tables 3A and 3B</ref> in the appendix for male and female rats, respectively.</p><p>Reviewer's findings: Based on the criteria of adjustment for multiple testing discussed above, there was no tumor types or combined tumor types which were considered to have a statistically significant positive dose response relationship in male rats. The pairwise comparison did show a statistically significant increase in incidence of adenoma cortical in Adrenal (which was considered as a rare tumor) in MD groups compared to the control (p=0.0184&lt;0.05).</p><p>In female rats, a statistically significant positive dose response relationship was noted in adenoma islet cell for pancreas of female rats (p=0.0323&lt;0.05) if this tumor was considered as a rare tumor. No other statistically significant findings were noted for female rats.             <ref type="figure">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</ref> </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacokinetics</head><p>Romosozumab is a humanized IgG2 monoclonal antibody that binds and inhibits sclerostin. By blocking sclerostin, romosozumab increases bone formation due to the activation of bone lining cells, increased bone matrix production by osteoblasts, and recruitment of osteoprogenitor cells. Additionally, romosozumab results in changes to expression of osteoclast mediators, thereby decreasing bone resorption.</p><p>The following is a summary of clinical pharmacokinetics of romosozumab:</p><p>Romosozumab exhibited nonlinear pharmacokinetics across the SC and IV dose ranges of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg and 1 to 5 mg/kg, respectively. Exposure increased greater than dose proportionally (e.g., 550-fold increase in mean AUC from time 0 to infinity [AUCinf] for the 100-fold increase in SC dose from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Absorption:</head><p>Administration of a single dose of 210 mg romosozumab in healthy male and female subjects (n = 90, age range: 21 to 65 years) resulted in a mean (standard deviation [SD]) maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of 22.2 (5.8) mcg/mL and a mean area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 389 (127) mcg*day/mL. The median time to maximum romosozumab concentration (Tmax) was 5 days (range: 2 to 7 days). Steady-state concentrations were achieved by month 3 following the monthly administration of 210 mg to postmenopausal women. Trough serum romosozumab mean concentration values from samples collected prior to dosing at months 3, 6, 9, and 12 ranged from 8.46 to 9.78 mcg/mL.</p><p>For a 210-mg SC dose of romosozumab, the estimated bioavailability was 81%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distribution:</head><p>The population PK analysis estimated volume of distribution at steady-state was 3.92L.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Renal function</head><p>Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated an increase in romosozumab exposure with increasing severity of renal impairment. The dedicated renal impairment study also showed that mean Cmax and AUC were 29% and 44% higher in patients with severe renal impairment as compared to healthy subjects while mean romosozumab exposure was similar between patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis and healthy subjects. Dose adjustment based on renal function is not warranted for the following two reasons: 1) the fixed dosing regimen (210 mg) was given to all subjects, including 10 subjects with severe renal impairment in the Phase 3 study and had an acceptable safety profile, and 2) data from the dedicated renal impairment study indicated that the incidence of hypocalcemia was associated with severity of renal impairment, but not with exposure of romosozumab. The number of subjects reported hypocalcemia was 0/8 in healthy subjects, 1/8 in subjects with severe renal impairment, and 4/8 in subjects had ESRD requiring hemodialysis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Available Treatments for Osteoporosis</head><p>Treatment for osteoporosis and the prevention of osteoporotic fractures consist of 1 class of bone-forming agents and several types of antiresorptive therapies, including bisphosphonates <ref type="table" target="#tab_87">(Table 1)</ref>.  Study 20120277 and 20150197 were the two pivotal PK comparability studies to bridge the drug product tested in Phase 3 studies (the single-use glass prefilled syringe (PFS) containing 70 mg/mL romosozumab) and the proposed drug product for marketing (the single-use PFS containing 90 mg/mL romosozumab). Details of these two studies can be found in Section 4.3.  Study 20060220 was the first-in-human study for romosozumab in which single ascending doses of romosozumab up to 10 mg/kg for SC and 5 mg/kg for IV were tested in healthy men and postmenopausal women.  Study 20060221 was the first multiple-dose study in patients with low bone mass.</p><p>Subjects enrolled in this study were treated with placeo, 1 mg/kg Q2W, 2 mg/kg Q2W, 2 mg/kg Q4W, or 3 mg/kg Q4W for 3 months, all by SC administration.  Study 20110227 was the dedicated renal impairment study.This study was conducted because of the following reasons: 1) Despite the large molecular weight, eGFR was found to be a significant factor in the PK of several monoclonal antibodies <ref type="bibr">(Zhu et al, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Frey et al, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Struemper et al, 2013)</ref>. 2) Additionally, chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been implicated with disturbances of the Wnt pathway with an elevated level of serum sclerostin reported in CKD subjects <ref type="bibr">(de Oliveira et al, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Brandenbury et al, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Drueke and Lafage-Proust, 2011</ref>). An inverse relationship was found between serum sclerostin and eGFR in CKD subjects <ref type="bibr">(Pelletier et al, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cejka et al, 2014)</ref>.  Study 20060223 was a single-dose study in postmenopausal women with low bone mass who had been receiving alendronate for at least 1 year and in postmenopausal women with low bone mass who were treatment-naïve for osteoporosis/bone loss. The objective of the study was to investiage PK, PD, safety and tolerability of romosozumab in subjects transitioning from alendronate to romosozumab study.  In addition, Study 20090153 and 20110253 also provided supportive PK information of romosozuamb while the primary objectives of these two studies were to evaluate the PD of romosozumab. Study 20090153 was designed to evaluate the effect of romosozumab on parameters of bone quality of the forearm using peripheral quantitative computed tomography and Study 20110253 invesitgated the percent change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD after 3 months of romosozumab administration in postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density previously treated with alendronate.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bioanalysis</head><p>Romosozumab concentrations in human serum were quantified by a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using specific anti-idiotype antibodies for capture and detection of romosozumab.</p><p>Briefly, microplate wells were coated with mouse anti-humanromosozumab antibody to capture romosozumab. Unbound materials were removed by washing the wells. Horseradish peroxidase-labelled mouse anti-human-romosozumab antibody was used for the detection of the captured romosozumab. The nominal assay range for lower limits of quantification and upper limits of quantification was 50.0 to 2500 ng/mL, and the dilution linearity was established for up to 1:10000 dilution. See Section 4.1 for more information.</p><p>PK model The PK of romosozumab was described by a three-compartment PK model with linear distribution to peripheral compartments, parallel linear elimination in the central compartment and target-mediated nonlinear elimination in the peripheral compartments.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Incidence</head><p>In Phase 1 studies, about 7.9% (66 of 832) of subjects developed binding antibodies after at least 1 dose of romosozumab. All positive subjects showed a persistent binding response with a positive result at the last time point tested. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 27.3% (18 of 66) of binding antibody positive subjects.</p><p>The incidence of anti-romosozumab binding ntibodies in clinical studies with repeated dosing was higher than the antibody incidence following a single dose. About 20% (852 of 4289) of subjects exposed to romosozumab in the Phase 2 and 3 studies developed binding antibodies. The antibody responses were transient (i.e., became negative by the last time point tested) for 48.6% (414 of 852) of the binding antibody positive subjects.

Romosozumab treatment produced pharmacodynamic effects in changes of bone turnover markers (an increase in P1NP and a reduction in CTX-I) as well as an increase in the bone mineral density (BMD). During clinical development multiple studies evaluated these PD effects, including two Phase 3 studies (Study 20080289 and Study 20120156) that had bone mineral density (BMD) at Month 6 as the primary efficay endpoint and the pivotal Phase 3 study (Study 20070337) which had BMD and bone turnover markers as secondary endpoints.</p><p>The pivotal evidence of effectiveness is from the Phase 3 pivotal trial (Study 20070337) which is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study with 2-year fracture data.</p><p>The following sub-sections further provide details of the fracture data, the BMD data, and the data for bone turnover markers.</p></div>

After the double-blind period, subjects entered a 12-month denosumab follow-on study period in which they received denosumab 60 mg SC <ref type="formula">Q6M</ref> in an open-label fashion while remaining blinded to their initial treatment assignment. The primary analysis was conducted after all subjects completed the 24-month visist. The co-primary efficacy endpoints were subject incidence of new vertebral fracture through Month 12 and Month 24.</p><p>The applicant's analysis showed that romosozumab significantly reduced the risk of new vertebral fractures compared with placebo through Month 12 (odds ratio = 0.27, p &lt; 0.001), with a relative risk reduction of 73% (risk ratio = 0.27 [95% CI: 0.16, 0.47]).

The romosozumab 140 mg QM and 210 mg QM dose groups also demonstrated statistically significant increases when compared with ALN (p &lt; 0.0001) and TPTD (p ≤ 0.0276). Lumbar spine BMD continued to increase from Month 12 to Month 24 in all but the 140 mg Q3M romosozumab dosing group; the BMD increases were greatest in the 210 mg QM group <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1.</ref>) Compared with the placebo group, each of the romosozumab groups showed a significantly increased lumbar spine BMD (p &lt; 0.0001) at month 18 and 24.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.3">Is an alternative dosing regimen and/or management strategy required for subpopulations based on intrinsic factors?</head><p>No. There is no need for alternative dosing regimen for subpopulations based on the intrinsic factors. The proposed dosing regimen with a fixed dose of 210 mg given monthly is appropriate for the general indicated population.</p><p>However, use of romosozumab in patients with severe renal impairment and with ESRD requiring or without dialysis should be carefully monitored for hypocalcemia.</p><p>The applicant conducted a dedicated renal impairment study investigating PK of romosozumab in healthy subjects (n=8), subjects with severe renal impairment (n=8), and subjects who have ESRD requiring hemodialysis (n=8). Subjects have ESRD without dialysis was not enrolled into this study. The exposure in patients with severe renal impairment was higher than that in healthy subjects. Mean Cmax and AUC were 29% and 44% higher in patients with severe renal impairment as compared to healthy subjects. However, the exposure range in these two groups have substantial overlap. Most of the subjects with severe renal impairment had values that were within the range of healthy subjects, specifically, Cmax in 7 out of 8 subjects and AUC in 6 out of 8 subjects. Meanwhile, romosozumab PK was similar between healthy subjects and ESRD subjects requiring hemodialysis. The scientific explanations behind this observation are unclear at this time. When it comes to safety, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events in the dedicated renal impairment study was hypocalcemia. Data suggested that the incidence of hypocalcemia was associated with severity of renal impairment, but not with exposure of romosozumab. The number of subjects reported hypocalcemia was 0/8 in healthy subjects, 1/8 in subjects with severe RI, and 4/8 in subjects had ESRD requiring hemodialysis.</p><p>Based on the population PK (PopPK) analysis (Section 4.5), no significant impact of gender, age, race (Japanese/non-Japanese), prior alendronate, and drug product manufacturing process on romosozumab exposure were identified. However, body weight and severity of renal impairment would affect PK of romosozumab.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">Bioanalytical assays for immunogenicity assessment</head><p>Two validated assays were used to detect the presence of anti-romosozumab antibodies in human serum. Samples were first tested in an ECL-based bridging immunoassay to detect antibodies capable of binding to romosozumab (binding antibody [Bab] assay). Samples confirmed to be positive for binding antibodies were subsequently tested in a non-cell-based assay to determine neutralizing activity against romosozumab (neutralizing antibody [Nab] assay) for all studies. If a sample was positive for binding antibodies and demonstrated neutralizing activity, the sample was defined as positive for neutralizing antibodies. See Product Quality Review (immunogenicity section) for more detailed information regarding the immunogenicity assay validations.</p><p>This section provides a summary of assay information relevant to clinical pharmacology assessments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3.1">Binding Antibody Assay</head><p>This ECL-based homogenous bridging immunoassay method is based on the bivalent characteristics of the antibody binding and utilizes the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) platform. The testing strategy follows a two-tiered assay approach consisting of a screening assay and a specificity assay. The screening assay is performed to detect the presence of binding antibodies to romosozumab. Samples with a signal-to-noise (S/N) value greater than the assay cut-point are then tested to confirm the specificity of the response. Samples from drug-treated subjects tested in the specificity assay that deplete in the presence of excess soluble drug are reported as positive for the presence of anti-romosozumab antibodies.</p><p>Samples are treated with acetic acid to enable antibody complex dissociation before the analysis. Samples are then incubated overnight with conjugate/neutralization mixture consisting of biotinylated romosozumab: ruthenylated romosozumab (50:50), Tris pH 9.5, and soluble drug (only in the specificity assay). During this overnight incubation, the 2 antigen binding sites of anti-romosozumab antibodies are able to form a bridge between the labeled romosozumab molecules. The biotinylated-romosozumab molecule binds to the streptavidin-coated surface of the well resulting in the immobilization of the bridged ADA-conjugate complex. The plate is then washed, treated with tripropylamine MSD read buffer, and read on a MSD plate reader. The result is a luminescent signal from a series of electrically induced oxidation-reduction reactions involving ruthenium (from the captured complex) and tripropylamine. The consequent ECL signal is measured by photodiodes and is quantified as ECL units. The amount of ECL signal is proportional to the amount of anti-romosozumab antibodies in the sample.</p><p>The binding antibody assay sensitivity and drug tolerance in human serum are provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table  4</ref>.1.4. In the pivotal Phase 3 study, afte 210 mg monthly dosing, trough serum romosozumab mean concentration values from samples collected prior to dosing at months 3, 6, 9, and 12 ranged from 8460 to 9780 ng/mL. In the same study, samples for anti-romosozumab antibody were collected at baseline, months <ref type="bibr">1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 24</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3.1">Neutralizing Antibody Assay</head><p>To detect the presence of antibodies that are capable of disrupting the binding of romosozumab to sclerostin in serum samples, an ECL-based competitive target binding assay was developed. This assay utilizes the MSD platform and follows a tiered, two-assay approach consisting of a screening assay and a confirmatory assay. Samples that show reactivity in the screening assay are placed in a confirmatory assay that confirms that the interruption of the binding between romosozumab and sclerostin observed in the screening assay is due to the presence of antiromosozumab neutralizing antibodies. The combined results of the screening assay and confirmatory assay are used to determine if a sample is positive or negative for neutralizing antibodies against romosozumab.</p><p>The method for the detection of anti-romosozumab neutralizing antibodies uses ruthenylated romosozumab and biotinylated sclerostin. In this assay, the anti-romosozumab antibodycontaining sample is incubated with ruthenylated romosozumab and biotinylated sclerostin and allowed to form a binding complex. The binding complex is captured on an avidin-coated MSD plate. The plate is then washed and read on a MSD plate reader. The result is a luminescent signal from a series of electrically induced oxidation-reduction reactions involving ruthenium (from the captured complex) and tripropylamine. The consequent ECL signal is measured by photodiodes and is quantified as ECL units. If there are anti-romosozumab neutralizing antibodies present in the sample, they will compete with biotinylated sclerostin for the binding to the ruthenylated romosozumab; therefore, the amount of binding complex captured on the plate is reduced and the result is a decrease in ECL signal in the assay. To confirm that a sample contains anti-romosozumab-specific neutralizing antibodies, an excess amount of romosozumab is added exogenously to the sample, which will bind to anti-romosozumab antibodies and reduce the amount of anti-romosozumab antibodies available to bind to ruthenylated romosozumab, thus resulting in an increase in ECL signal in the assay.</p><p>The assay sensitivity and drug tolerance for human serum for romosozumab bioassay are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>.1.5. In the pivotal Phase 3 study, samples for anti-romosozumab antibody were collected at baseline, months <ref type="bibr">1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 24</ref>.

The study included a 24-month initial treatment phase during which subjects received romosozumab (419 subjects randomized to receive 70 mg, 140 mg, or 210 mg), placebo, or active control. Romosozumab and placebo were given QM or Q3M; one active control group received alendronate for the first 12 months followed by romosozumab for another 12 months, and the other active control group only received teriparatide 20 mcg QD for 12 months.

Trough concentration values increased greater than dose proportionally. At Month 12 and Month 24, mean Ctrough at the 210 mg QM dose were 10-fold greater than concentrations at the 70 mg QM dose. Overall, the data indicate a greater extent of accumulation for 210 mg QM dosing than at 70 mg QM dosing.</p><p>For the Q3M cohorts, accumulation was minimal. The peak serum romosozumab concentrations increased 1.6-fold after the first dose and after the 12th dose for the 1.5-fold increase in dose from 140 to 210 mg. Mean romosozumab concentrations at trough time points for Q3M cohorts were below the quantitation limit (BQL).</p><p>The mean peak concentrations after the first dose of romosozumab at 140 mg QM for the cohort that received ALN treatment for the first year and for the cohort that received 24 months of romosozumab at 140 mg QM were similar at 12500 and 12400 ng/mL, respectively. Serum romosozumab Ctrough values ranged from 2590 to 5150 ng/mL for the ALN cohort and ranged from 2780 to 4770 ng/mL for the romosozumab 140 mg QM cohort.

Peak romosozumab concentrations increased 3.6-fold over the romosozumab 70 to 210 mg dose range (3-fold increase in dose). Mean serum concentrations measured 1 week after the administration of the first dose of romosozumab (day 8) were 7150, 16500, and 25600 ng/mL for the romosozumab 70, 140, and 210 mg groups, respectively. Trough serum romosozumab mean concentration values (from samples collected before dose administration at months <ref type="bibr">1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12)</ref> after multiple administrations with romosozumab ranged from 777 to 911 ng/mL, 3730 to 4590 ng/mL, and 6060 to 10400 ng/mL in the romosozumab 70, 140, and 210 mg groups, respectively. Trough concentrations demonstrated greater than dose proportional increases with ascending dose in the dose range of 70 mg to 210 mg, with the Month 12 time point exhibiting a 12-fold increase in concentration for a 3-fold increase in dose.

The scope of the analysis was decided for the following reasons: 1) Subject showed significant impact of immunogenicity on PK. 2) Study 20060326 had a retreatment period after subjects were off romosozumab for 12 months and, therefore, provided a good opportunity of investigating immunogenicity after retreatment. 3) The pivotal Phase 3 Study 20070337 enrolled 7180 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, which represents about 80% of the entire patient population in this submission. In general, the higher S/N ratio is, the lower the romosozumab exposure is. Impact of immunogenicity on PK based on S/N ratio is summarized as follows:</p><p> One of the neutralizing antibody positive subjects (Subject ) from Phase 1 study 20060220 was inadvertently enrolled and dosed in a subsequent ascending multi-dose pharmacology/pharmacodynamic study 20060221.

Of note, 10 mg/kg was the highest dose tested in the romosozumab clinical development program. On , a non-serious adverse event of injection site erythema was reported as mild in severity, related to study drug and resolved on with no further action taken. The subject was positive for binding antibodies on (study day 57; S/N value = 1.61) and for neutralizing antibodies on (end of study [study day 85]; S/N value = 37.30). The subject returned for follow-up antibody testing as specified in the protocol. Prior to re-exposure of romosozumab in study 20060221, the subject's S/N values ranged from 382.05 to 1019.50. The subject was still positive for neutralizing antibodies when, in violation with the protocol in/exclusion criteria, she enrolled in romosozumab Study 20060221 (subject number ) and received a second dose of romosozumab at 1 mg/kg SC on and then every 2 weeks until . At the time the subject was enrolled into Study 20060221, the investigator was not aware of her prior participation in the first-in-human study. The subject was tested for anti-romosozumab antibodies as per protocol, every month during Study 20060221 and approximately every 3 months after last dose: she remained positive for neutralizing antibodies as of and was then lost to follow up. Throughout the study, the range of S/N for subject was between 333.40 (before first dose) and 7,454.68; following the peak S/N value of 7,454.68 on study day 141, the values decreased over time to 639.83 at the subject's last follow-up visit. </p></div>

Therefore, these covariates had no impact on romosozumab exposures and no dose adjustments are proposed based on these factors. Body weight and renal function (as measured by eGFR) were significant covariates with increasing exposure predicted for decreasing body weight or eGFR.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.2">Reviewer's comments:</head><p>The reviewer found the Applicant's population PK model structure for romosozumab reasonable. The applicant's population PK dataset included ESRD patients with hemodialysis from study 20110227 (the dedicated renal impairment study) When the reviewer reran the population PK analysis, these patients were removed for the following reasons.</p><p>1. Data from the dedicated renal impairment study showed that the exposure in severe renal impairment subjects was 44% higher than that in subject with normal renal function, whereas the exposure in ESRD subjects with hemodialysis was comparable to that in subjects with normal function ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>). The reason behind the scene is unknown as hemodialysis does hardly remove large molecules. In the dedicated renal impairment study, PK samples were intensively collected over 85 days after a single dose of 210 mg. When hemodialysis occurred on a day of sample collection, sample collections were performed before hemodialysis. The frequency of hemodialysis in ESRD patients was not specified. It appears that the impact of hemodialysis on PK of romosozumab is inconclusive. 2. On the other hand, the VPC plot ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>) from study 20110227 shows that the observations of severe renal impairment subjects were slightly under-predicted and observations of ESRD subjects with hemodialysis were slightly over-predicted. When reviewer reran the population PK analysis without the ESRD subjects, the parameter estimates were consistent with Applicant's results except that the power-law coefficient estimate of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was changed from 0.189 to 0.219 1 .</p><p>One thing to mention, the eGFR values used in the Applicant's population PK model was calculated using the following equation:</p><p>= 186 × ( ) -1.154 × ( ) -0.203 × 0.742( ) × 1.212( )</p><p>The coefficient (186) was different from the value (175) used in the <ref type="bibr">Phase 3 dataset (adbase.xpt)</ref>. The coefficient of 175 is recommended in FDA guidance with regard to dedicated renal impairment study (http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/Guidances/UCM204959.pdf). However, the difference is not expected to result in significant change in population PK results. Thus, the reviewer used the dataset as provided by the Applicant.</p><p>Based on the reviewer's assessment, except bodyweight and renal function, other covariats , including gender, age, race (Japanese/non-Japanese), prior alendronate, and drug product manufacturing process do have not signifant impact on romosozumab exposure.</p><p>The impact of body weight and renal function were independently evaluated by the Reviewer using the updated population PK model. Summary values based on these covariates for the Phase 3 data are provided below in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 5</ref>. The reviewer is presenting information in this manner so that it is easier to compare exposures differ between patients with various degrees of renal impairment to exposures in patients with normal renal function. The exposures were comparable for normal, mild and moderate renal impairment patients. The exposure in severe renal impairment patients was imprecise due to the limited number of patients with severe renal impairment included in the Phase 3 trials. According the simulation, the exposure in severe renal impairment are expected to be 1.6-fold higher than that in normal renal function patients, respectively. Considering the fixed dosing regimen was given to Phase 3 study with an acceptable safety profile, no dose adjustment is needed for patients based on renal impairment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.2">Exposure-BMD analysis</head><p>The effect of romosozumab concentrations on the time course of BMD changes in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis was analyzed by the Applicant. The studies included in this PK/PD analysis are:</p><p>Protocol 20060326: A multi-center, international, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in approximately 400 postmenopausal women with low BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip or femoral neck. The study consisted of three phases: 1) 24-month romosozumab treatment phase (day 1 to Month 24); 2) 12-month denosumab/placebo phase (Month 24 to month 36); 3) 12-month romosozumab retreatment phase (month 36 to month 48).</p><p>Protocol 20101291: A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in Japanese women with osteoporosis defined as low BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip or femoral neck. Approximately 220 subjects were to be randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive either70 mg, 140 mg or 210 mg romosozumab SC QM or matched placebo SC QM for the duration of the 12-month treatment period.</p><p>Patient demographics at screening are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 9</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">Table 10</ref>. The study population consisted of 522 females with ages ranging from 55.3 to 84.8 years, PMO ranging from 1 to 45 years, and weights ranging from 32.5 to 95.9 kg. There were 301 non-Japanese and 251 Japanese subjects, and all but one Japanese subject was enrolled in study 1291.  Initial modeling was performed using the mechanistic PK/PD model developed to describe the ontreatment PD efficacy (BMD) effects of romosozumab using the 24-month initial treatment phase Study 60326 and 12-month Study 1291 data. Individual romosozumab PK parameter estimates for PK/PD modeling were derived in population PK analysis (section 4.5). The effects of study (1291 vs. 60326) on baseline BMD were included in the base model. The base model also included an effect of DXA (hologic vs. lunar) machine type on baseline BMD.</p><p>In the final model, the body weight and PMO were added to the population PK/PD model. Diagnostic plots revealed that the model was consistent with the observed data and little systematic bias was evident ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_38">Figure 9</ref>). The VPC results revealed that the full model for two-year efficacy provided a reliable description of the data with adequate precision of structural model and variance parameter estimates ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>). Parameter estimates are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_87">Table 11</ref>. The population mean estimate for logit(Ima x ) was -0.812 (67.0%), corresponding to an I max value of 0.307. Estimates for IC 50 and SC 50 were 70.4 ng/mL and 22,600 ng/mL. Differences in baseline BMD for study 1291 subjects (approximately 15% lower) and lunar machine measurements (15% higher) were identified.   Once a suitable population PK/PD model was developed, an extension to the base model was developed to describe the on-treatment, off-treatment and re-treatment PD efficacy (BMD) effects of romosozumab using only Study 60326 data that included the off-treatment (nominal months 24-36) and romosozumab re-treatment. Additional model development was driven by deviances between the model-predicted and observed markers for the off-treatment and re-treatment periods. The final model was updated by adding a rebound and rebound precursor pool with the precursor affecting the resorption cavity input. VPC results for the re-treatment model are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>. These VPC plots were stratified by the romosozumab dose regimen that was administered prior to the offtreatment period. Results were presented for the entire study period (0-48 months), the off-treatment phase only (24-36 months), and the re-treatment phase only (36-48 months).</p><p>To conclude, the two-year efficacy of romosozumab was described by exposure-BMD model. The model provides a reasonable representation of the effects of romosozumab on BMD.</p></div>

Efficacy results from Study 142 are thoroughly reviewed in Section 8.1.2. Since efficacy results from Study 337 were previously reviewed with the original submission, this review only provides a summary of the efficacy results from Study 337 (in Section 8.1.5). Efficacy results from Study 174 are not addressed in this review, as the study population is not one for which an indication is currently sought. The safety evaluation is based on safety results from Study 337, Study 142 and Study 174. All safety results from Study 142 are thoroughly reviewed in Section 8.2. Since the safety results of Study 337 were previously reviewed in detail with the original submission, this review will only summarize key safety results of Study 337 in Section 8.2. General safety results from Study 174 are not addressed in this review, as the study population is not one for which an indication is currently sought. The cardiovascular safety results from Study 337 and Study 174, however, are included in this review alongside those of Study 142 (in Section 8.2.5, Analysis of Cardiovascular Safety). The study was conducted at 270 centers in 41 countries (89 centers in Western Europe and Australia/New Zealand, 88 centers in Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East, 49 centers in Central/Latin America, 26 centers in North America, and 18 centers in Asia Pacific and South Africa).</figDesc><table><row><cell>20070337/</cell><cell>Randomized,</cell><cell>Romosozumab 210</cell><cell>Incidence of</cell><cell>24 months</cell><cell>7180</cell><cell>Post-</cell><cell>222</cell></row><row><cell>01575834</cell><cell>double-blind,</cell><cell>mg SC QM or</cell><cell>new vertebral</cell><cell>with 12</cell><cell></cell><cell>menopausal</cell><cell>centers</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>placebo-</cell><cell>placebo SC QM for</cell><cell>fracture at</cell><cell>month</cell><cell></cell><cell>osteoporosis</cell><cell>countries</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>controlled</cell><cell>12 months followed</cell><cell>month 12 and</cell><cell>extension</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>by denosumab</cell><cell>month 24 (co-</cell><cell>period with</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>60mg SC Q6M for</cell><cell>primary)</cell><cell>open-label</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>12 months</cell><cell></cell><cell>denosumab</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>20110142/</cell><cell>Randomized,</cell><cell>Romosozumab 210</cell><cell>Subject</cell><cell>Event driven</cell><cell>4093</cell><cell>Post-</cell><cell>270</cell></row><row><cell>01631214</cell><cell>double-blind,</cell><cell>mg SC QM or</cell><cell>incidence of</cell><cell>median</cell><cell></cell><cell>menopausal</cell><cell>centers</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>active-</cell><cell>alendronate 70 mg</cell><cell>clinical fracture</cell><cell>follow-up 33</cell><cell></cell><cell>osteoporosis</cell><cell>41</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>controlled</cell><cell>po QW for 12</cell><cell>and new</cell><cell>months;</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>countries</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>months followed by</cell><cell>vertebral</cell><cell>minimum 24</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>alendronate 70 mg</cell><cell>fracture</cell><cell>months</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>po QW</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell cols="2">Studies to Support Safety</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>20110174/</cell><cell>Randomized,</cell><cell>Romosozumab 210</cell><cell>Percent change</cell><cell>12 month</cell><cell>245</cell><cell>Men with</cell><cell>31 centers</cell></row><row><cell>02186171</cell><cell>double-blind,</cell><cell>mg SC QM or</cell><cell>from baseline in</cell><cell>treatment</cell><cell></cell><cell>osteoporosis</cell><cell>10</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>placebo-</cell><cell>placebo SC QM</cell><cell>lumbar spine</cell><cell>period</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>countries</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>controlled</cell><cell></cell><cell>BMD at 12</cell><cell>15 months</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>months</cell><cell>total follow-</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>up</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="3">SC = subcutaneous; QM = once monthly; po = orally</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row></table><note>: A Multicenter, International, Randomized, Double-blind, Alendronate-controlled Study to Determine the Efficacy and Safety of Romosozumab in the Treatment of Postmenopausal Women With Osteoporosis Investigators and Study Centers:</note></figure>

Atypical low-energy or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in patients receiving romosozumab See section 8.3.6 Significant Adverse Events. Labeling can manage this risk as the number of AFF cases observed to date is low and all cases had confounding factors. Since romosozumab has antiresorptive activity, as demonstrated by BTM profiles and histomorphometry data from bone biopsies, ONJ is an important potential risk for romosozumab. Osteonecrosis of the jaw, which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients receiving romosozumab. See section 8.3.6 Significant Adverse Events. Labeling can manage this risk as the number of ONJ cases observed to date is low and all cases had confounding factors. Like other monoclonal antibodies, romosozumab could be associated with hypersensitivity reactions. Based on medical review of the integrated safety data, hypersensitivity is considered an important identified risk with romosozumab. Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, erythema multiforme, and urticaria, occurred in the romosozumab group.

At Month 12, cancellous BFR/BS was similar to placebo (cortical Month 12 data not available). o Increase in intracortical/Haversian bone formation based on ca. 2X increase in MS/BS (% mineralizing surface) (statistically significant) and intracortical BFR/BS (not-statisticallysignificant), but no change in MAR (osteoblast activity parameter). o No effect on cortical porosity, thus intracortical resorption was likely increased too. o Marked decrease in Ps.BFR/BS (due to decreases in MS/BS and MAR) at Month 2 (change from baseline) that was marginally significant (p=0.08), in a small number of biopsies. However, there was no change in average Ps.BFR/BS at Month 2 in a larger study group. Data on Ps.BFR/BS at 12 months were not available. o Mlt increase in cancellous bone at Month 12, and slight significant O.Th increase at Month 2 but not Month 12. However, in light of normal bone histology, the data did not appear to indicate a significant mineralization defect. Increase or maintenance of the romosozumab-induced increase in bone mass (i.e. BV/TV, Tb.Th). o Decreases in cancellous ES/BS and Oc.S/BS, as compared to placebo (0-12 mo). The decreases appeared to be smaller than those caused by romosozumab, indicated by increases in these parameters as compared to those in romosozumab-treated (0-12 mo). Data on effect of Dmab on Ec.ES/BS were not available. o Reversal of increase in W.Th in romosozumab-treated, at 24 vs 12 months. o Decrease in cancellous MS/BS and BFR/BS at 24 vs 12 months, in both groups, as expected based on anti-resorptive effects of Dmab; values at Month 24 were similar in both groups. o Decreased AcF in both groups at Month 24 vs Month 12. o No effect on Co.Po% at Month 24 vs 12; no difference between groups. o No effect on O.Th or Mlt at Month 24 vs 12 and no difference between the 2 groups.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Significant decreases in erosion surface ES/BS% and Oc.S/BS at the cancellous surface</cell></row><row><cell>(Effect at Month 12 larger than at Month 2) and decrease in endocortical Ec.ES/BS</cell></row><row><cell>(Month 2 data only), consistent with the decrease in systemic resorption markers (e.g.</cell></row><row><cell>serum CTx).</cell></row><row><cell>o Denosumab (Dmab, 60 mg SC, once every 6 months) administered in the 12-24 month period,</cell></row><row><cell>after placebo or 210 mg/mo romosozumab, had the following effects:</cell></row><row><cell>o</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

On July 19, 2016, Amgen submitted an original BLA, which included a 24-month phase 3 placebo-controlled fracture study(Study 337)   in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. During the review cycle, the sponsor notified the FDA of preliminary results from two studies (Studies 142, and 174) intended for a future supplement. Study 142, an active-controlled study in women, identified a higher incidence of serious cardiovascular (CV) events in the romosozumab arm (2.5%) compared to the alendronate arm (active control) (1.9%). A similar trend was observed in Study 174, a placebo control study in men with osteoporosis.The key safety endpoints were major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and cardiovascular serious events (CV SAEs) adjudicated by Duke University Research Institute. The safety analysis included events observed during the double-blind 12-month period. The sponsor estimated the incidence and hazard ratio (HR) of MACE and CV SAE in each study. They conducted a meta-analysis, which compared romosozumab to alendronate and placebo combined. To distinguish the effect of alendronate on CV risk from the placebo effect, the reviewer conducted a network meta-analysis which compares multiple treatments simultaneously in a single analysis by combining direct and indirect evidence within a network of randomized controlled trials. The reviewer's analysis only included studies conducted in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis (Studies 337, and 142). The HR in Study 337 comparing romosozumab to placebo was approximately 1.0. In contrast, in Study 142 comparing romosozumab to alendronate, the HR was 1.87 [95% confidence interval (CI):1.11, 3.14], indicating an increased risk of MACE in the romosozumab arm compared to alendronate arm. The network meta-analysis resulted in a HR of 0.55 [95% CI: 0.27, 1.14] when comparing the risk of MACE in the alendronate arm to the placebo arm. This suggests that the large HR estimate in Study 142 might be because the incidence of MACE was low in the active control arm.It is difficult to discern whether the increased risk of MACE identified in the romosozumab arm in Study 142 is truly a drug effect, chance finding, or because of alendronate's potential protective effect on MACE. However, because a similar trend was noted in the study of osteoporosis in men (Study 174), this signal provides corroborate evidence and should not be ignored.Romosozumab (EVENITY ® ) is a sclerostin inhibitor indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture. The proposed dose of romosozumab is 210 mg administered subcutaneously once every month for one year. 5%) arm. In contrast, the incidences of serious CV events in Study 337 were similar across arms (1.3% romosozumab and 1.3% placebo).OnJuly 13, 2017, the FDA issued a complete response letter stating that a complete analysis of Study 142, as well as an integrated assessment of cardiovascular risk from the above phase 3 studies (Studies 337, 142 and 174) would be needed to complete the benefit-risk assessment of romosozumab. In response, the sponsor submitted the Comprehensive Cardiovascular Report (CCR) on June 28, 2018, in the current submission.On August 17, 2018, the Division of Bone, Reproductive, and Urologic Products consulted the Division of Biometrics VII to evaluate the CV safety signal associated with romosozumab. This document is the statistical review of the CV safety of romosozumab.</figDesc><table><row><cell cols="3">1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 2 INTRODUCTION</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="2">2.1 Study Overview</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>-</cell><cell cols="2">On July 19, 2016, Amgen</cell></row><row><cell cols="5">submitted an original BLA, which included a 24-month phase 3, placebo-controlled fracture ANDREA BENEDICT 03/02/2017 study (Study 337) in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.</cell></row><row><cell cols="5">During the review cycle, the sponsor notified the FDA of preliminary results from Study 142, a</cell></row><row><cell cols="5">phase 3 trial, intended for a future supplement.

The network meta-analysis resulted in a HR of 0.55 [0.27, 1.14] when comparing the risk of MACE in the alendronate arm to the placebo arm. This suggests that the HR estimate in Study 142 might be because the incidence of MACE was low in the active control arm. However, the network meta-analysis had limitations because it only used two studies, which led to wide confidence interval. In addition, the HR comparing the alendronate arm to the placebo arm was estimated indirectly.It is difficult to discern whether the increased risk of MACE identified in the romosozumab arm in Study 142 is truly a drug effect, chance finding, or because of alendronate's potential protective effect on MACE. However, because a similar trend was noted in a study of osteoporosis in men (Study 174), this signal provides corroborate evidence of risk and should not be ignored.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

Based on the clinical trial data, hypocalcemia is considered an important identified risk. Mild and transitory decreases in albumin-corrected calcium and a compensatory increase in iPTH were observed after initiation of romosozumab Based on the totality of data, the risk of hypocalcemia is manageable with appropriate monitoring recommended for patients with stage 5 CKD. See sections <ref type="bibr">8.3.8</ref> Laboratory evaluations. Labeling can manage this risk.</p><p> Hyperostosis: The intended pharmacologic effect of romosozumab is an increase in BMD and bone strength; however, hyperostosis (excessive bone growth) may be a potential risk with romosozumab administration. The current data, including the audiology substudy, do not support a safety risk of hyperostosis with romosozumab use; however, given the mechanism of action for romosozumab, it is considered a potential risk. See section <ref type="bibr">8.4.4</ref> Hyperostosis. The data does not support a safety risk for hyperostosis with romosozumab.</p></div>

Romosozumab is expected to increase bone formation and bone mass. The sought indication for the BLA is the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Romosozumab was evaluated in Phase III studies in postmenopausal women at a dose of 210 mg by subcutaneous injection every month (QM). The intended treatment duration is 1 year. The sponsor submitted the data from a 2-year lifetime carcinogenicity study in rats to their BLA application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rat Carcinogenicity Study:</head><p>Romosozumab was given to Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 0 , 3, 10, 50 mg/kg/week (60/sex/group) weekly via sc injection for a minimum of 91 weeks in males and 98 weeks in females. Dose selection was based on the expected pharmacologic effect in bone, clinical exposure multiples, and the lack of significant toxicity in a completed 6-month rat toxicity study. ECAC concurred with the study design <ref type="bibr">(October 11, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Findings: The survival at the end of study was between 25-40% and comparable across all groups.

No effects on mating, fertility, male reproductive parameters (sperm analyses or organ weights), ovarian or uterine parameters, embryo-fetal survival or fetal body weights were observed.</p><p>At 300 mg/kg, there were 3 fetuses from 3 litters that had reduced ventral processes (which develop into the carotid tubercles) on the 6th cervical vertebrae, slightly exceeding the historical range of the test facility, which was considered to represent a developmental delay (development of the ventral processes of the cervical vertebrae proceed in an anterior to posterior direction and the ventral processes on the 7th cervical vertebrae had not started to develop at gestation day 21). No other fetal effects were observed at any dose level. , blood samples were collected from all animals for determination of AMG 785 serum concentrations and anti-AMG 785 antibodies (ADA). These data were used to select animals that were suitable for further evaluation based on whether they were ADA negative or if ADA positive, had lowest signal-to-noise ratio (used to assess strength of ADA response) and/or highest AMG 785 serum concentration values. At DS 22, 37% of the females and 53% of the males had measurable anti-AMG 785 antibodies (and were eliminated), with signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio ranging from less than 10 to more than 1000.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PRIOR FDA DOSE CONCURRENCE: Yes</head><p>RAT CARCINOGENICITY: Negative.</p><p>RAT TUMOR FINDINGS: There were no AMG785-related tumor findings.</p><p> Macroscopically, there were AMG785-related macroscopic findings in bones (miscellaneous, calvarium femur, lumbar vertebrae L5-L6, sternum and tibia) and spleen. There was also AMG785-related thickening of the bone in males and females, in a dose dependent manner, correlating with the increase in bone mineral content (BMC) by ex vivo peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) and hyperostosis, microscopically. This effect was systemic, usually affecting all routinely collected bones. An increased incidence of spleen enlargement was noted in females at  3 mg/kg and in males at 10 mg/kg/dose, correlating with increased extramedullary hematopoiesis microscopically.</p><p> Microscopically, there were no neoplastic changes associated with AMG785 administration. The sponsor identified two significant findings. Renal lipoma in 3/60 females at 50 mg/kg (p =0.0486 by trend test, when compared to 1/60 in concurrent control; marginally above historical control data range). Adrenal cortical adenoma in 6/60 males at 10 mg/kg (p = 0.0169 by pairwise comparisons, when compared to 0/60 in concurrent control; within historical control data Page 3 of 41 range). Since renal lipoma was a rare tumor, it would be considered significant when the p value was ≤ 0.05. However, due to absence of pre-neoplastic lesion findings, the increased incidence in the female HD group had no toxicological significance. On the other hand, adrenal cortical adenoma was not a rare tumor, it would be considered significant when the p value was ≤ 0.01. Therefore, the increased incidence in the male MD group had no toxicological significance.</p><p> Microscopically, there were two osteosarcomas noted in the males at 50 mg/kg, which were not statistically significant by trend test and pairwise comparison, but the incidence was 3.7%, marginally higher than the historical range of 3.33%. Long term use of PTH has been known to result in osteosarcomas, osteoma, and osteoblast hyperplasia. Due to lack of pre-neoplastic findings and other bone tumors, the sponsor considered these as spontaneous.</p><p> FDA statistical review: tumor analysis did not show any statistically significant dose-response relationship in tumor incidence in tumor types tested in male rats. The pairwise comparison did show a statistically significant increase in incidence of adenoma cortical in MD groups compared to the control in male rats (p=0.0184&lt;0.05) and a statistically significant positive dose response relationship in adenoma islet cell for pancreas in female rats (p=0.0323&lt;0.05), if these tumor were considered as a rare tumor. No other statistically significant findings were noted for female rats.</p><p> Microscopically, there were non-neoplastic changes associated with AMG785. Bones: increased incidence of hyperostosis was noted in all dose groups. Spleen: increased incidence of secondary extramedullary hematopoiesis was noted in all dose groups (male: 13/60, 38/60, 44/60, 40/54 and female: 37/60, 49/60, 57/60, 60/60 in Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively). Liver: increased incidence of secondary extramedullary hematopoiesis was noted in all dose groups (male: 5/60, 13/60, 13/60, 12/54 and female: 22/60, 25/60, 41/60, 39/60 in Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively). Injection sites: mononuclear cells infiltrate was noted in all dose groups. However, changes in bones, spleen, and liver were dose dependent, whereas changes in injection sites were not dose dependent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RAT STUDY COMMENTS:</head><p>The 104 week rat study via sc injection was conducted to assess the carcinogenic potential of AMG785. The study was terminated at Week 91 for male groups and Week 98 for female groups. The survival at the end of study was between 25-40% and comparable across all groups. There were non-neoplastic changes associated with AMG785 administration in bones (hyperostosis), spleen and liver (secondary extramedullary hematopoiesis), and injection sites (mononuclear cells infiltrate), which were all expected pharmacological effect of AMG785. However, there were no neoplastic changes associated with AMG785 administration. The sponsor identified two tumor findings that were significant (i.e. renal lipoma in 50 mg/kg females; p = 0.0486 by trend test, adrenal cortical adenoma in 10 mg/kg males; p = 0.0169 by pairwise comparison). Since renal lipoma (rare tumor) and adrenal cortical adenoma (common tumor) had no pre-neoplastic lesion findings, and there was a lack of dose , there were between 36-43 rats/sex/group died or euthanized. AMG785 had no effects on the overall survival rate or mortality.  There were increased bone radiopacity in almost all males and females treated with AMG785 that correlated with thickening of the bone (macroscopically) and hyperostosis (microscopically). This was an expected pharmacological effect of AMG785.  Marked dose-related increases in bone mass and geometry were noted at the femur metaphysis and diaphysis. Trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) was 4-fold and 6fold higher in males and females, respectively, when compared to vehicle controls.  There were no AMG785-related neoplastic findings.  There were AMG785-related non-neoplastic findings. However, findings were limited to pharmacological effect of AMG785, including hyperostosis, secondary extramedullary hematopoiesis in spleen/liver, and mononuclear cell infiltrate at the injection sites.  There were no satellite TK groups included in this study. However, at <ref type="bibr">Week 13,</ref><ref type="bibr">there</ref> were minimal or no differences in mean AMG785 serum concentration among animals.  Anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) were found in 1 female and 10 males at 50 mg/kg, 3 males at 10 mg/kg, and 18 males at 3 mg/kg. These ADA-positive animals had reduced mean serum AMG785 concentration when compared to ADA-negative </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ADA and TK Parameters: Week 13</head><p>At week 13, 33%, 19%, and 25% of female rats developed anti-drug antibody (ADA), and 70%, 28% and 42% of male rats developed ADA at 3, 10, and 50 mg/kg, respectively.</p><p>The ADA positive samples determined by immunoassay from Groups 2 through 4 were then analyzed in the bioassay to detect the presence of neutralizing ADA (Nab). Rats in the 3, 10, and 50 mg/kg AMG 785 dosed groups with ADA positive and Nab positive were then removed from the study per the protocol amendments 7 and 8. This removal reduced the group size to: 60, 60, and 60 in females and 60, 60, and 54 in males at 3, 10, and 50 mg/kg dosed groups. Among remaining animals, all rats were negative for Nab. However, there was a total of 32 ADA positive rats retained (1 female and 31 males).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In Vivo and Ex Vivo Bone Measurements: At necropsy</head><p>An increased bone radiopacity was noted in almost all AMG785 treated males and females (73%, 88%, and 85% in males and 97%, 93%, and 92% in females at 3, 10, and 50 mg/kg, respectively). This was systemic affecting all bones and was considered an expected pharmacological effect of AMG 785, correlating with hyperostosis of bones observed microscopically. No other AMG 785-related effects were noted based on the distribution of radiological changes among all groups. Radiographic bone production, bone loss or mixed reaction was noted in a few rats at miscellaneous bone sites or in the femur and tibia, generally correlated with macroscopic and microscopic histological changes.</p><p>Page 15 of 41</p><p>With regard to femur metaphysis, there was a significant increase in femural bone mineral density (BMD) in all AMG785 treated animals, in a dose dependent manner (30%, 60%, and 79% in males and 33%, 79%, and 116% in females at 3, 10, and 50 mg/kg). There was also a significant increase in femural bone mineral content (BMC) in all AMG785 treated animals, in a dose dependent manner (2x, 3x, and 4x in males and 2x, 4x, and 6x in females at 3, 10, and 50 mg/kg).</p><p>With regard to femur diaphysis, there was a significant increase in femur diaphyseal parameters in both males and females at all doses. Cortical BMD was increased in animals by 3-4% at 50 mg/kg in both sexes. Cortical thickness increased at 3, 10, or 50 mg/kg by 43%, 80% and 113% in males and by 25%, 58% and 106% in females, respectively, attributed to increases in periosteal circumference at 10 and 50 mg/kg, and marked decreases in endosteal circumference at all dose levels. These geometric changes resulted in increases in cross-sectional moment of inertia (CSMI) of 61% and 116% in </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</head><p>The Applicant is seeking the approval of EVENITY® (romosozumab) for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture. Romosozumab is a humanized IgG2 monoclonal antibody that binds and inhibits sclerostin. By blocking sclerostin, romosozumab increases bone formation due to the activation of bone lining cells, increased bone matrix production by osteoblasts, and recruitment of osteoprogenitor cells. Additionally, romosozumab results in changes to expression of osteoclast mediators, thereby decreasing bone resorption.</p><p>Romosozumab is administered by subcutaneous injection. The proposed dosing regimen is 210 mg monthly for 12 months. EVENITY® should be administered by a healthcare professional and a full dose of EVENITY® requires two single-use prefilled syringes, each delivering 105 mg of romosozumab. The 210 mg monthly dosing for 12 months was selected for Phase 3 studies based on a Phase 2 dose ranging study. The Applicant additionally submitted results of 8 clinical pharmacology studies in healthy subjects, subjects with low bone mineral density, and postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (PMO) to support the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of romosozumab.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Recommendations</head><p>The Divisions of Clinical Pharmacology 3 and Pharmacometrics have reviewed the information contained in BLA 761,062. The review team recommends approval of this BLA from a clinical pharmacology perspective if inspection results of the analytical and clinical sites of the two pivotal PK comparability studies (Study 20120277 and 20150197) are acceptable (The inspection results will become available on 04/19/17). The key review issues with specific recommendations and/or comments are summarized below:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Review Issue Recommendations and Comments</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pivotal or supportive evidence of effectiveness</head><p>The pivotal Phase 3 study 20070337 (n = 7157) provides the primary evidence of effectiveness. Subjects treated with romosozumab (12 months) followed by denosumab (12 months) had a reduced risk of fracture at Month 12 and Month 24 compared to subjects treated with placebo (12 months) followed by denosumab <ref type="formula">(12 months</ref>). In addition, romosozumab/denosumab treatment is associated with an increased bone mineral density in lumbrar spine, total hip, and femoral neck compared to placebo/denosumab at Month 12 and Month 24.</p><p>The Phase 2 dose ranging Study 20060326 provides supportive evidence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">6</ref> was estimated to be 0.383 mL/hr/kg, following a single SC administration of 3 mg/kg. The mean effective t1/2 was 12.8 days after 3 SC doses of Q4W 3 mg/kg.</p><p>Development of ADA was associated with reduced serum romosozumab concentrations. One subject tested neutralizing antibody positive in the first in human single dose Phase 1 study had a rapid decline in romosozumab serum concentrations after retreatment. After a single dose of 1mg/kg, romosozumab serum concentration rose to 2010 ng/ml on Day 5 dropped below the lower limit of quantification (BQL = 50 ng/mL) on Day 7 and remained BQL through the PK sampling window up to 168 days, despite continued dosing once every two weeks. In the Phase 3 studies, the presence of binding ADAs appeared to decrease romosozumab exposure up to 25% at months 3, 6, and 9. The exposures became comparable (approximate 10% difference in mean values) at month 12 between ADA positive and ADA negative subjects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intrinsic Factors:</head><p>Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no notable difference in pharmacokinetics with age (20-89 years), gender, race, or disease state (low bone mass or osteoporosis) was shown.</p><p>The exposure of romosozumab decreased with increasing body weight.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specific Populations:</head><p>Renal Impairment: Following a single 210 mg dose of romosozumab in a clinical study of 16 patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis, mean Cmax and AUC were 29% and 44% higher in patients with severe renal impairment as compared to healthy subjects. Mean romosozumab exposure was similar between patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis and healthy subjects. PK of romosozumab was not evulated in ESRD patients without dialysis. A population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated an increase in romosozumab exposure with increasing severity of renal impairment.</p><p>Prior exposure to alendronate: The pharmacokinetics of romosozumab was similar in patients transitioning from alendronate therapy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Dosing and Therapeutic Individualization</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">General dosing</head><p>The proposed dosing regimen is 210 mg monthly for 12 months.</p><p>The dose-response relationship for efficacy from the Phase 2 dose-finding study and the efficacy data from the pivotal Phase 3 study, where only one dose level was studied, support a recommendation of the 210 mg monthly dosing. In the Phase 3 study only Ctrough were collected, therefore the AUC data in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> were predicted for the PK substudy population using the population model parameters estimated for each individual. Furthermore, due to the small number of subjects with severe renal impairment study 20070337, the reviewer simulated exposures in severe renal impairment using the same covariate model to evaluate the effect of renal impairment. The covariate model was developed based on a total of 10 subjects with severe renal impairment (8 from the dedicated renal impairment study and 2 from the pivotal phase 3 study 20070337). Please note, Study 20070337 had 10 subjects with severe renal impairment but only 2 of them had PK data.</p><p>An increasing exposure was also predicted for decreasing eGFR. In particular, the predicted exposure for patients with severe renal impairment was ~60% higher than subjects with normal renal function; which is consistent with what observed in the dedicated renal impairment study (Study 20110227). In the dedicated renal impairment study, mean AUC were 44% higher in patients with severe renal impairment as compared to healthy subjects.</p><p>Dose adjustment based on renal function is not warranted for the following two reasons: 1) the fixed dosing regimen (210 mg) was given to all subjects, including 10 subjects with severe renal impairment in the Phase 3 study and had an acceptable safety profile (Section 4.6), and 2) data from the dedicated renal impairment study indicated that the incidence of hypocalcemia was associated with severity of renal impairment, but not with exposure of romosozumab.</p><p>An increasing exposure was predicted for decreasing body weight. In particular, the predicted exposure for subjects in the lowest quartile of body weight was ~50% than that in the highest quartile of body weight; which could have the potential to affect the safety profile. However, the fixed dosing regimen (210 mg) was given to all subjects in the pivotal Phase 3 study and had an acceptable safety profile. Therefore, dose adjustment based on body weight is not warranted (Section 4.6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.4">Are there clinically relevant food-drug or drug-drug interactions and what is the appropriate management strategy?</head><p>Food-drug interactions are not applicable as romosozumab is administered by SC injection.</p><p>Disease-drug-drug interactions are not applicable because postmenopausal women with osteoporosis do have not much elevated proinflammatory cytokins based on the current understanding.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study sites</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Source: Reviewer's independent analysis.</head><p>The results elucidate that the exposures were relatively higher in low body weight patients and lower in high body weight patients, but the magnitude of difference between 1 st and 4 th quantile will be less than 1.5-fold. The difference in exposure across body weight is considered as relatively small and not clinically significant. Thus, no dose adjustment is necessary based on body weight.</p><p>The results indicate that the BMD is comparable across renal function categories. The similar conclusion can be drawn based on the primary efficacy endpoint, new vertebral fracture. There is no trend that the BMD %CFB and/or new vertebral fracture rate would be increased in more severe renal impairment patients. On the other side, BMD %CFB was decreased around 37% and 34% for 12 and 24 month in highest body weight group compared to that in lowest body weight group. However, this difference did not result in any clinically significant differences in incident rates of new vertebral fracture across body weight range. All these results demonstrate that no dose adjustment is necessary based on body weight and renal function from efficacy perspective.</p><p>From safety perspective, only one subject with hypocalcemia was identified in the Phase 3 study. In the dedicated renal impairment study <ref type="bibr">(Study 20110227)</ref>, hypocalcemia were reported to 5 subjects, 1 severe renal impairment subject and 4 ESRD subjects with hemodialysis. Based on <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> in section 4.5, the exposure in ESRD subjects with hemodialysis was comparable to that in normal renal function subject. Thus, the higher event rate of hypocalcemia is not driven by the exposure, which further support that no dose adjustment is necessary based on renal function.</p></div>			</div>
