However, embryo and fetal toxicities were seen (see ). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. ZYVOX should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus." If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated." 5. The following paragraph was added to the end of the section:</p><p>"Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible." 6. In the section, under the heading , the word "most" in the beginning of the second sentence of the first paragraph was changed to "some" and it now reads:</p><p>"In some of these cases, a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures was reported."</p><p>We completed our review of these applications, as amended. These applications are approved, effective on the date of this letter, for use as recommended in the agreed-upon labeling text.</p><p>The final printed labeling (FPL) must be identical to the enclosed labeling (text for the package insert) submitted March 28, 2007.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.0">Purpose of Supplement</head><p>This supplement is submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 314.70 (c)(6)(iii) to revise the WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS sections of the labeling for ZYVOX ® on the grounds of safety. This submission is in response to a letter sent by the Division dated September 29, 2006, stating: "The Agency has recently reviewed the safety labeling of marketed antimicrobials with regard to Clostridium difficile associated disease (CDAD). Recent epidemiologic and scientific data indicate that outbreaks of a highly virulent strain of C. difficile have emerged in various health care facilities. These infections have been reported with antimicrobial agents and appear to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality. To ensure consistency in the communication of these risks, the Division of Anti-Infective and Ophthalmology Products, in collaboration with the Division of Special Pathogen and Transplant Products, is requesting that changes be made to the following sections of the package insert in order to provide adequate information: WARNINGS section and PRECAUTIONS/ Information for Patients subsection."</p><p>This submission also amends the label to implement the Division's one modification to Pfizer's proposed language regarding convulsions in the PRECAUTIONS/General subsection of the ZYVOX ® label.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.0">Submitted materials:</head><p>The electronic submission contains the following sections:</p><p>• Cover letter dated March 28, 2007 • Completed FDA 356h Forms for the three applications;</p><p>• <ref type="table">Labeling Table of Contents:</ref> -SPL labeling for ZYVOX ® -Marked-up labeling document;</p><p>MO Comment: The review of the three labeling supplements is integrated since the applicant's proposed labeling revisions for the current package inserts are identical and apply to these applications. The differences between these applications are in the dosage form, strengths, and route of administration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.0">Applicant's Proposed revisions:</head><p>(Note: Deletions are marked with strikethrough and additions are underlined.)</p><p>1. In the WARNINGS section, paragraphs describing pseudomembranous colitis have been replaced with the text below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(b) (4)</formula><p>"Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including ZYVOX ® and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.</p><p>C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use.</p><p>Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated."</p><p>2. The following text has been added to the PRECAUTIONS/Information for Patients subsection:</p><p>• "Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible."</p><p>MO Comment: The applicant's language as stated above (#1 and #2) is consistent with that of the Division's language stated in the letter dated September 29, 2006. 3. In the PRECAUTIONS/General subsection, the following revision proposed by the Division has been implemented by the applicant:</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.0">Review of Supporting Information</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Convulsions</head><p>According to the applicant, a search of the safety database was conducted for linezolid cases reporting convulsions from September 1, 1999 through April 30, 2005. Pfizer states that the cumulative search was obtained from spontaneous reports, adverse event registries, health authorities, medical literature, cases of serious adverse events reported from clinical studies, and solicited cases from marketing programs. The applicant reports a total of 39 relevant cases including three cases from clinical study reports and 36 from other sources. The 3 clinical study cases were assessed by the reporter as serious and briefly summarized as follows:</p><p>1. Mfr. report #2000021611US: This is a 39-year-old male with AIDS and chronic MRSA osteomyelitis who was enrolled in a compassionate use of linezolid study in the United States. On April 10, 2000, the patient was administered linezolid 600 mg BID orally and two days later developed seizures. The report states that the patient has a history of deep limb venous thrombosis but no history of seizure disorder. However, five days prior receiving linezolid, the caregiver reported that the patient had an episode of tonic/clonic jerking movement of his extremities followed by loss of consciousness lasting 2-3 minutes. Concomitant medications included Bactrim-DS, efavirenz, mirtazapine, olanzapine, and paroxetine. The reporter considered these medications along with linezolid as co-suspect medications. According to the report, the event did not recur with rechallenge.</p><p>2. Mfr. report #200002120530PH: This is a 38-year-old female who developed generalized skin lesions and diagnosed as Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. The patient was treated initially with vancomycin (dosing regimen unknown). Concomitant medications included vitamin A (Retinol), vitamins (Iberet-500) and ferrous sulfate. After approximately seven days of vancomycin treatment, the patient's medication was changed to linezolid 600 mg bid (oral). The patient was entered into the clinical study. The patient's condition apparently improved as reported and was discharged on the 13 th day of hospitalization with instructions to complete a one-month course of linezolid. Approximately on day 22 of linezolid therapy, the patient developed seizures and found to be in septic shock with acute renal failure secondary to Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. The patient was admitted to the hospital and was treated. The report states that linezolid was discontinued. The patient's condition apparently improved after treatment with phenobarbital, pressor agents, and antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam). The reporting physician assessed the events as possibly related to the study medication. The report states that the sponsor did not agree with the investigator's assessment.</p><p>3. Mfr. report #2002134072DE: This is a 74-year-old male patient who developed MRSA sepsis that was treated with linezolid. On the 6 th day of treatment, the patient developed generalized epileptic seizures. On the 17 th day, the patient developed septic shock and died. According to the report, blood cultures obtained on that day were positive for MRSA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-clinical study cases:</head><p>The applicant reported a total of 36 non-clinical study cases of convulsions as summarized in the following table: Age and medical history were unknown. The patient was hospitalized for 45 days, and during this period he received two courses of linezolid (indication and dose/frequency were unknown); the first course lasted for 14 days and the second lasting for 10 days. According to the report, the patient went into a vegetative state while in ICU developed multiple seizures and MRSA pneumonia. After stopping the second course of linezolid, the patient was apparently well enough to be transferred to the general medical unit. But, four days later, the patient died. The report states that the role of linezolid in relation to patient's death, and the cause of death were unknown.</p><p>Applicant's Overall Assessment:</p><p>Of the 39 cases reporting convulsion, one case was excluded from further analysis because the reported event "tremor" was not considered relevant. In 12 cases, information including patient's medical history, event onset date, duration of drug therapy at event onset, and linezolid therapy dates were not provided. In 6 cases of convulsion, concomitant medications with reasonable temporal relationships to the event could have caused or contributed to the reported event. These medications include ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, meropenem, erythropoietin, ondansetron, olanzapine, and efavirenz. of seizure developed seizure while on carbamazepine and linezolid treatment that was reported by the treating physician as suspected drug interaction or could be related to the high fever of the patient. Five of the patients had underlying serious illnesses which could possibly contribute to the seizures.</p><p>The remaining 13 cases, an alternate etiology could not be determined from the information provided. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> summarizes these cases.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>. Six of the 7 patients with history of seizure were reported to have recovered and one patient had an unknown outcome. Two patients (#2004200390DE, and #2005024277) without known histories of seizures were reported to have a positive dechallenge and rechallenge. These two patients apparently recovered from the event after discontinuing linezolid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of time interval from treatment with linezolid and development of seizures for both Sponsor's and AERS cases:</head><p>(MO Note: The mean and median were calculated based on the same observations (i.e., number of days). One case was reported to have 10 minutes latency and another case of about 2 hours. Based on this analysis and review of these cases, it is still difficult to make a definite conclusion on the time of onset of seizure because of limited information provided, the underlying medical conditions of the patients, and concomitant medications contributing to the relevant event.)    MO Comment: The reviewer reviewed 27 cases (unduplicated) from AERS database. Five of these cases <ref type="bibr">(#6114675, GXKR2004US006624, 190002, and 2002124082 US)</ref> with reports of convulsions could possibly be under the spectrum of serotonin syndrome. Spontaneous reports of serotonin syndrome associated with concomitant administration of linezolid and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been reported and mentioned in the label. One death was reported in a 58-year old male patient (#2006038618) with history of hypertension and COPD. The patient received linezolid 1200 mg (interval, route and indication were unknown). According to the report, the patient developed grand mal convulsion five days after linezolid therapy. Concomitant medications included voriconazole, fentanyl, amitriptyline and omeprazole. EEG and brain CT scan were apparently normal. Causality assessment by the reporter was unknown. The reported events were grand mal convulsion and drug interaction.</p><p>Six patients <ref type="bibr">(# S4121613 [4334483-2]</ref>, #5711887 (4549428-X), #2006077872, #2006049276, #2006027475, and #158761) had a history of seizure as described in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Most cases have limited information about the patient's history, concomitant medications, and reporter's causality assessment to make definite conclusions to the etiologies of convulsions/seizures.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. Hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis/allergic dermatitis/ Stevens-Johnson syndrome</head><p>The applicant's reports of hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock and allergic dermatitis were obtained from spontaneous reports, adverse event registries, medical literature, clinical studies, and company's sponsored marketing program (solicited cases) regardless of causality. The database was reviewed for linezolid cases coded to the MedDRA preferred adverse event terms MO Comment: The applicant did not mention cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome in the search. AERS reports had a total of 11 linezolid cases of SJS, one case of possible of SJS and TEN, three cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), 3 cases of Lyell's syndrome, and 2 cases of possible DRESS (Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome). Three deaths were reported with cases of SJS:</p><p>• #2000018584GB: A 74-year old male with a history of hypertension, angina, diabetes mellitus, bladder tumor, pleural effusions, renal and heart failure. developed MRSA empyema and was started on teicoplanin and rifampicin (duration of therapy was unclear in the report). Concomitant medications included diltiazem and isosorbide mononitrate. The patient developed extensive maculopapular rash on abdomen and back. The antibiotics were stopped. Linezolid was started at 600 mg BID I.V. on and after four days of therapy, patient developed a widespread rash with conjunctival and mucosal involvement. The reporting physician felt that this was SJS. Linezolid was stopped. The dermatologist impression was severe erythrodermic drug reaction and not classical SJS or erythema multiforme. The rash was reported to have improved but recurred after a day. The patient was started on gentamicin and fucidin. However, her condition deteriorated and she died on . The patient was diagnosed with left ventricular failure, myocardial ischemia, diabetes mellitus and erythroderma caused by drug reaction. According to the sponsor, there is reasonable possibility that the reaction is causally related to the medications, including linezolid. The fatal outcome is likely due to the poor general condition of the patient and underlying disease.</p><p>• #2001086126GB: A 21-year old male with history of florid hepatitis and aplastic anemia developed septicemia due to VRE and Enterococcus faecium resistant to ampicillin. The report states that linezolid was the only treatment option. Dose and duration were unknown. The patient experienced rash, swollen lips soon after starting linezolid which was reported as SJS. The patient died on an unspecified date. No details of this report were provided. The consultant believes that linezolid was probably not the direct cause of death. The reporter stated that the patient was probably taking other drugs for his aplastic anemia and that a causal relationship to linezolid cannot be excluded. There were no reports of deaths with the reports of anaphylactic reactions in the AERS cases.</p></div>

Please refer to your new drug applications (NDAs) for ZYVOX ® (linezolid) tablets, (NDA 21-130), ZYVOX ® (linezolid) IV injection (NDA 21-131), and ZYVOX ® (linezolid) for oral suspension (NDA 21-132).</p><p>The Agency has recently reviewed the safety labeling of marketed antimicrobials with regard to Clostridium difficile associated disease (CDAD). Recent epidemiologic and scientific data indicate that outbreaks of a highly virulent strain of C. difficile have emerged in various health care facilities. These infections have been reported with antimicrobial agents and appear to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality.</p><p>To ensure consistency in the communication of these risks, the Division of Anti-Infective and Ophthalmology Products, in collaboration with the Division of Special Pathogen and Transplant Products, is requesting that package inserts of all marketed antimicrobial products currently labeled with regard to CDAD be updated, and changes be made to the following sections of the package insert in order to provide adequate information: WARNINGS section and PRECAUTIONS/ Information for Patients subsection.</p><p>1. In the WARNINGS section, paragraphs describing pseudomembranous colitis should be replaced with the text below. The drug product name (as it appears in the label) should be inserted where shown.</p><p>"Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including [INSERT DRUG NAME HERE], and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.</p><p>C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use.</p></div>
